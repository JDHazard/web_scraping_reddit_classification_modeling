1,Comicboy87,comicbooks,Say what you want about Morrison Batman or Snyder but those run are legend They are so good Even when I don understand Morrison sometimes I still get the idea and understand maybe 80 percent Snyder batman is radically different in term of hopey preachy batman Tom King just doesn do it for me It so boring He us the same panel shot through story telling and corny line like because I batman are so bad And I think Maybe it not fair because you had 2 great before who fucking made crazy as story arc with their writing I gave King a chance 50 issue is too gracious but I can anymore,It really hard for me to like Tom King Batman when it wa Grant Morrison and Scott Snyder before him

11,7thSon_,comicbooks,I looking at getting some Hellboy next I see that there are omnibi a well a the smaller red stripe tpb volume looking at Seed of Destruction Wake the Devil etc Are there any difference between these other than the amount of issue collected in each Some of the omnibi seem to run up to 500 page which is maybe a bit on the large side I like reading tpbs because of the light format But collecting the red stripe tpbs is definitely more expensive in this case hence the question about any content difference,Looking to start Hellboy which format

14,Ellie_Ganza,comicbooks,It hard to be a invested in comic because I tired of the repetitive reboots which force u to reevaluate the character or story one grows up reading There no consistency What is the point of killing off a character when you know they revive them soo ex Scarlet Witch Rogue Captain America remember how it took 20 YEARS for marvel to resurrect Illyana AKA Magik whereas no barely a month go by It also piss me off that comic change story so it fit with the movie like changing Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver into Inhumans because of the MCU and Fox drama or changing Nebula into a psychotic monster into a morally ambiguous character who also resembles now the movie version And don get me started on the Spider Family Before it wa just Spider Man and occasionally Spider Woman Jessica Drew Julia Carpenter and now you have endless variation,Do you feel the constant reboots and resurrection have hurt comic when it come to narrative structure

19,fastzander,comicbooks,To me it not so much a superhero powerset or costume that make them interesting but their backstory personality and attendant theme To me it doesn matter if a superhero ha a similar powerset and or costume to another superhero if their story is original and thought provoking It is for these reason that I prefer Sentry and Blue Marvel over Superman Sure their power are basically the same a his but their premise I believe are far more engaging than Superman ha ever been Superman is just a goody two shoe 1950s boy scout Insufferably wholesome righteous chivalrous infallible always doing the right thing incapable of thinking a bad thought he rescue cat from tree and help old lady across the street and everyone love him And yes I know that I generalizing here that there is more to Superman than this and that there have been some very in depth exploration into defence of his psyche and why he act the way he doe over the year so don flame me Superman fan but the above is the basic spirit of him Sentry and Blue Marvel on the other hand seem to have far more creative nuanced serious personality and backstories to me Think about it Sentry wa an unemployed overweight middle aged drug addled loser who essentially created his persona to escape from the crushing mediocrity of his life plenty of room for commentary here on the escapist aspect of the superhero genre who wa present during the entirety of his world superhero history but wa forced to retroactively erase himself from it and who now struggle with mental illness and a constant battle with the dark side of his own self Blue Marvel meanwhile wa a black man who possessed superpower during the Civil Rights era and could have used them to rise up against white people yet made the choice not to even a he incurred the scorn of both his own people and white people and wa forced to give up his career by the president due to the latter fear and who wa eventually forced to battle his own former best friend when said friend attempted to found a world free of racism To me the latter two simply come off a possessing far more interesting past and far more psychological complexity than Superman To me the premise of the latter two come off a involving far more interesting theme and subject which could be spun off into far more interesting storyline There far more moral ambiguity and far fewer easy way out,Sentry and Blue Marvel are more interesting than Superman IMO

65,SimSimeon01,comicbooks,I did a quick search and couldn find much discussion on it and most of the talk here seems centered around Marvel and DC book but I thought I ask anyway for the following reason I wa able to follow it fine up to issue six but starting with issue seven thing have gotten very confusing I reread the entire series so far a number of time and I am still at a loss It make sense up to issue six There IS stuff in there that not spelled out but it seems to be intentionally vague to create a sense of mystery or because it scary supernatural weirdness But starting in issue seven a plot point wa introduced that is very unclear to me and I wa wondering if anyone could explain to me what exactly is meant to be going on The character in the story themselves seem to understand it fine from their reaction so either I just not getting it personally or well the writing is just poor here As I said up to this point thing made sense and when something wa unclear the character in the story didn understand what wa going on either But in issue seven stop reading here a I am going to get into spoiler In issue seven Carnahan seems to be revealing that the dead refugee couple were in fact the modern holy family and that their dead newborn wa meant to be the Second Coming of Christ Carnahan killed them because he the Anti Christ Apparently all the child killing stuff wa irrelevant and Carnahan just partook in it because the vessel mean Carnahan physical body just enjoyed it This leaf me very confused because Carnahan say a number of other thing that implies he is not nor ha he ever been Carnahan He seems to say that he is the Anti Christ a separate being from Carnahan and possessed Carnahan body after he killed the refugee baby so Jesus couldn use Carnahan a his vessel instead This is very confusing for a number of reason First the Anti Christ thanks Shaw for killing Carnahan implying that he emptied the vessel of a soul so he could posse it instead of Christ There a number of problem with this One if Carnahan and the Anti Christ are separate being wouldn Carnahan soul still be occupying his body So if Christ can take the body now that the Anti Christ occupies it how could Christ take the bod if Carnahan soul wa still in it Second why would Christ second choice for a vessel be a sadistic child killer who work with pedophile to murder kid Some random middle aged guy is a weird choice why not just be born to some other couple But even if you accept that some middle aged guy is a good second option why a child killer I know Ennis isn a fan of Christianity and put blasphemy into his comic for fun but this doesn seem like an attempt to be edgy or shock ala Preacher It seems like Ennis is attempting to write a straight faced religious horror story and in that context why would Christ want to occupy the body of a serial killer who is under investigation by the police for connection to pedophile who murder kid Wouldn that make ministering to his flock or fighting the Anti Christ even more difficult than it otherwise would be Third I not even sure if Carnahan and the Anti Christ are meant to be separate being because one moment Carnahan talk like he is the Anti Christ who is just now occupying Carnahan newly dead body but in issue eight he talk about murdering his family a a child because he wa the Anti Christ all his life This would also make sense of his supernatural ability to make witness to his activity go on shooting spree and the pedophile he worked with commit suicide It pretty inconsistent and leaf me very confused Fourth why is Carnahan and or the Anti Christ continuing to fuck with the police He killed Jesus so it it kind of mission accomplished Why is he doing weird spooky shit in this warehouse Isn he just drawing unnecessary attention to himself If you were the Anti Christ wouldn you want everyone to be ignorant of the fact you stopped the Second Coming By drawing attention to it wouldn you just give people faith in God And for that matter why do all the pedophile serial killer stuff Again isn that just drawing unwanted attention to yourself if the real goal is just stop Jesus from redeeming mankind Anyway I just really baffled by all this Ennis is one of my favorite comic book writer and I never been this confused by his writing before Is there something I missing If you reading the book so far and it make perfect sense to you can you fill me in on what up I wa largely enjoying it a lot up to issue six and now I just don know what to think,Is anyone else on here reading A Walk Through Hell by Garth Ennis

142,upyours192,comicbooks,So I read the following just to give you a list Captain America all of Golden lil bit of Silver and all of Bronze Sandman all of Golden and Bronze Challengers of the Unknown Thor 131 140 Annual 2 154 179 Fantastic Four 1 93 Annuals 1 7 X Men just the 1st ish SHIELD Atlas Kobra all of the Fourth World Saga Demon OMAC Kamandi Losers Days in the Mob Eternals 2001 Machine Man Devil Dinosaur Black Panther Silver Surfer that last one he did with Stan Lee Captain Victory Silver Star Super Powers Destroyer Duck and The Prisoner amp x200B I also got some opinion if anyone want to talk about them amp x200B First off any comic that I haven read that you think I should be him I gauge my taste from what I liked best to what I hated the most Best OMAC To Wake the Mangog Silver Star Worst Golden Age Sandman X Men Devil Dinosaur So Challengers of the Unknown is an obvious template for Fantastic Four Like even down to the random alien that picked up the Challengers is somewhat used again in FF The Fourth World Saga is an obvious continuation of Thor though a lot of the character in the Fourth World saga feel like reinterpretation of many other Marvel character Orion felt like the Hulk getting uncontrollably angry at time Lightray felt like a more mild version of the Human Torch Darkseid felt like Dr Doom a little only way more tamed down in term of showboating egotism Mister Miracle felt like a way nicer and le sexist Mr Fantastic right down to the way he would science his way out of thing and his relationship with Big Barda who felt like Thor meet Susan Storm Highfather wa a far nicer Odin Desaad felt like Loki The Forever People felt like a hippie version of The Challengers of the Unknown Big Bear felt like the antithesis to The Thing So I know that many people believe that Hunger Dogs is the ending to his Fourth World Saga but like Super Powers pick up like right after Also that Darkseid land felt like the inspiration for Grant Morrison far future JLA story where Darkseid won Devil Dinosaur felt like a poor man Kamandi Those human with super power in Kamandi felt like a super powered version of Challengers of the Unknown Darius Drumm wa like the insane ending to the constantly evolving symbolic character that represented fascism for Jack Kirby I mean obviously it started with Red Skull then Dr Doom strangely enough Hydra Kobra then Darkseid and finally Darius Drumm Am I missing anyone Would the Mad Bomb count from Cap America Maybe some of the baddie in The Losers I guess Silver Star wa the most meta and experimental I seen with Jack Kirby in term of storytelling It wa fucking insane Captain Victory wa the most Kirby in term of art I seen from him from the 80 Jesus christ 2001 wa insane OMAC is easily my favorite thing by Kirby Outside of the Mangog and Galactus v Ego story I didn care for Thor Was anyone else let down with The Losers So I noticed in many of his earlier work that hypnotism is like a really big way of dealing with enemy I saw it quite a bit for some character in his Golden Age Captain America and in Challengers of the Unknown it used a the most random way to beat enemy In FF they use it to defeat the Skrulls Doom the Doom us it Miracle Man us it etc And then hypnotism wa used many time in others story too It just seems very prevalent in his story Any one else notice that,I just read all the Jack Kirby comic I own What else by him should I read
143,SJW_NPC,comicbooks,Fairly new to reading comic book and just gave one of the worst comic a shot Since it looked like a fairly short read enjoyed the dynamic that I saw in the original civil war movie and it seemed appropriate since the Captain Marvel movie is currently just out in theater and she happens to be one of the most controversial figure from that comic While I fairly new to comic book I am not to storytelling and character from other medium So right now I feeling confident enough to have an opinion on character from this series since I seem to have a very strong opinion that go against almost everybody take I seen on this And while I agree that it far from the best story ever told and could been executed far better given the premise I however cannot for the life of me imagine how anybody can think that Captain Marvel is in the wrong here amp x200B I argue that the only good thing that Tony did wa investigate how the power of the inhuman work which to be fair Carol couldn really do on her own since she lacked the talent to do so amp x200B Now while both of them lose someone near and dear to them Only Tony seems like he acting out of emotion and while that might be very understandable given the context it really isn really a good point in his favor here amp x200B Captain Marvel act proactively to prevent disaster from happening and save countless life in doing so Yes she arrest people for crime they haven committed yet but I don see how that different from arresting a suspect for a murder bomb threat shooting These people aren convicted they simply put under arrest while the hero figure out the situation One could even argue from the perspective that planning to commit murder is considered a crime but I don have to since I don need to do so to defend Carol action here She isn convicting people for crime they didn commit she simply putting them under arrest Contrast that to Tony who spends most of his time demonizing Carol and whose only argument seems to be Captain America is on my side therefore I am right Hell it even revealed later that he trusted Carol with the situation but wouldn trust someone else with that same responsibility yet wasn able to articulate those thought The nail in the coffin is towards the end when Captain Marvel seems to be remedying the situation with spider man and Captain America but get attacked by Iron Man The good guy Then get his as kicked You can even argue that Carol is a Mary Sue because she get humbled quite a few time during this series Honestly it kinda reminds me of the absolute hatred people had for Korra from the Avatar series People seem to really hate the cocky brash confident and strong female lead no matter how well it executed and will hate the character regardless amp x200B What the hell am I missing here I can see how people didn think the comic wa good that a whole other subject but thinking the Captain Marvel wa so in the wrong that it made you hate her I cannot for the life of me understand this position,Why do people think Carol is the bad guy in Civil War II

201,SimJWill,comicbooks,So after completing this series I feel a little mixed I come to really enjoy limited run Superman story ala Secret Identity and while I enjoyed element of this story especially in the beginning Clark learning how to fly some thing I really thought were unnecessary I didn like that so many people knew about Clark power the entirety of issue 2 I thought wa overly dark and could have been executed better or left out entirely while it wa nice seeing Clark drinking and having fun because that wa a good way of humanizing him the serendipity of having him pretend to be Bruce I felt wa le charming and more of a reach The comic doe a better job of showing how established character meet in issue 4 where we see great portrayal of Lex Luthor and a fun aside with Dick Grayson Issue 5 wa good with showing how Clark learns to become a hero and work with police but then 6 double down on what I didn like from previous story and ha Clark Smallville friend chat about him being Superman Finally Issue 7 show Lobo Cue audience cheering whose anecdote about pissing in the skull of long dead Kryptonians while in character I think wa a bit over the top for my liking I know I probably in the wrong about this but when I read that part I wa taken out of the whole experience and just had to say wtf In conclusion these are all just my thought after an initial read through and by all account should not be taken a gospel If I had to rate the series I give it a 6 10,Superman American Alien

389,Old_Ironsides_58,comicbooks,Where do you turn when a big huge company like ReedPop Reed Exhibitions that run 500 event worldwide each year and ha a gross income of 9 5 billion each year doe you wrong This is a story that begin on October 6th last year at the NYC Comic Con but in way it actually begin all the way back in 1974 I wa sixteen year old back in 74 and attending my first Comic Book Convention in NYC There I received the 100 page program book that I still have to this day Back then artist and writer were only to happy to autograph your program for you and many would throw in a quick sketch too I wa thrilled to get over 20 autograph that year including such luminary a Neal Adams Jeff Jones and Jim Steranko just to name a few While I never lost my love of comic book I did drift away from them while in college and in the early year of raising a family I returned to them in the early 90 and have attended many a convention since then That program now contains over 200 different autograph and amazingly nearly 100 tiny sketch in the margin So when Alex Ross wa doing a promotional signing of Marvelocity with Chip Kidd at the NYC Comic Con this past fall I jumped at the chance He doe so few signing and Marvels wa one of my biggest favorite from the early 90 Alex never charge a fan for an autograph at this event you were purchasing the book from Penguin ReedPop which he would sign Also he would sign an additional second item for you I wa looking forward to adding his autograph to the 200 I already had in my 1974 program The signing ran from 1 30 to 3 00 I arrived at 1 15 and a one might expect many had arrived earlier As the line advance soon there were over 60 people behind me After over an hour we were herded onto an extremely large elevator and taken up to the floor for the signing What followed wa truly unfortunate We we told to stay in the elevator which then returned to the ground floor We were then informed that Alex wa spending longer with each fan than expected and we would not be able to meet him a promised a he had a prior engagement scheduled immediately after 3pm Our ticket were taken from u with multiple apologizes and the promise of a refund or a book a soon a they could arrange it While disappointed at my age you understand that these thing happen As you might expect it wasn the book that I wa looking forward to nor wa it obtaining Alex autograph What ha always meant the most to me is that brief encounter with those who imagination and talent entertain awe and inspire u that is what I treasure It matter not whether it is a name we all know or someone who ha just published their first comic book Imagine how it felt afterwards to discover from the people at Alex Ross Art that ReedPop had turned away those last 60 fan without first informing Alex Once Alex knew his team tried to find those who might still be in the area but sadly nearly all of u had dispersed Then to add insult to injury what followed over the next 3 month we multiple email in which I requested a refund that month after month never came Penguin Random House had attempted to arrange the refund but since ReedPop had collected the 66 00 it had to come from them My request achieved nothing my follow ups went nowhere and even threat were simply ignored Not once did ReedPop send me an email update or respond to my inquires Then something rather unique happened I had copied Eli at Alex Ross Art on some of the email and unbeknown to me they to had been working behind the scene since the beginning of January to try and get ReedPop to fix this They too had gotten nowhere with the multi billion dollar corporation However they were determined that this treatment wa not acceptable and asked me to send them a copy of my online ticket receipt for the event to aid in pursuing the issue They even promised to refund me what I had paid even though they never received a single penny of it I provided them with the requested evidence and they once again went to bat for the little guy This Monday ReedPop at long last contacted me stating that they had figured out why I hadn received the refund and it had now been processed Then yesterday a package arrived via UPS from the people at Alex Ross Art it wa a literal Swap Bag of goody containing over a dozen item including 3 signed print I have wonderful story of those I met over the 45 year that I been carrying around that program from 1974 Of how Moebius actually wrote a tiny greeting to his friend Sergio Aragonés back in 93 that Sergio then read 22 year later at SDCC Of winning a futuristic prop used in the TV series The Expanse while meeting James S A Corey Yeah both of them How Janet Lee and I have become friend when we discovered we both create hand made Christmas Tree ornament each year These are but a few of the many Though I never got to meet him of all the story I have how Alex Ross and his people stepped in for the little 6o year old guy is certainly finest and I wanted to share it with you all,An Alex Ross Story
390,Atmageth,comicbooks,When Bendis first announced he wa coming to DC I wa honestly incredibly apprehensive I hadn been reading much Marvel at the time but I had heard some of his recent output wasn great That said this wa the man who wrote Ultimate Spider Man so I decided to remain cautiously optimistic I am so happy i wa totally wrong Bendis book at DC are not only my favorite running right now but some of the best comic to come out of DC in recent time As a Superman fan his Superman run is basically just a dream come true Both of them just kick total as in every way Action is bringing that really strong street level feel Bendis is known for to the Daily Planet and I love the idea of the Invisible Mafia Superman is definitely not a strong a Action on a technical level but I think I prefer it just because of how much cool cosmic crap Bendis is bringing in I adore how well he connecting DC Cosmic together and with what he been teasing I even more excited for where it going Rogol Zaar ha a terrible Jim Lee design but his backstory is incredibly compelling Young Justice just launched but that first issue wa such a massive celebration of everything DC With this book spearheading the Wonder Comics imprint this ha the potential to be a fantastic platform for diverse character ala what Marvel is doing with Champions and the surrounding mini and ongoings The big thing though for me is these book are really making me feel excited and passionate about DC in way I havent really been feeling for a while Its been a major surprise to me but Bendis ha become a major voice at DC and he really revitalized that spirit I even more hopeful that the people he bringing with him like Kelly Sue DeConnick are going to have similar success,Can we talk about Bendis

408,Batpresident,comicbooks,It interesting to note how the two version of batman widely considered to be the best Nolan And Miller seem to be political antithesis to each other Miller Batman for example is motivated by rage and anger combined with a strong sense of punishing the wrong He the epitome of Vigilante justice He see the world going to shit he see the system fucking up and he want to BEAT THOSE FUCKERS UP In contrast Nolan Batman seems to be doing it more from moral obligation than anything There a focus that he thinking his motivation out that it not out of emotional sense of right and wrong In fact that method is explicitly condemned in this version where Rachel slap Bruce for planning to shoot Joe Chill after his trial failed This Batman belief in making a working system most seen when he see Harvey change a more legitimate change compared to his vigilante justice This difference is most exemplified when looking at what happens when Batman leaf his vigilante way for year The government ha failed and Batman ha to lead a resurgence in Gotham to establish peace and separate it from the rest of the country and then face Superman whose become a crony of the government The government ha succeeded even if through dishonest mean Batman personally aided in Batman ha to defeat Bane who lead a resurgence in Gotham that separate it from the rest of the country Hell N Batman actually end up serving the same role Superman typically doe in his story a a role model and symbol for the regular citizen to emulate There a feeling that if the two met they would see each other a the villain of their own story M a bane N a superman So I wa wondering ha this happened to other superheroes where there are two version almost opposite to each other What are the politics of other batman My batman experience is kind of limited so here are the one I personally experienced Zack Snyder Batman where he is something something cool fight scene I don know Right wing ish A serious house on serious earth where batman wa against the modern mental healthcare system Scientologist And a random crazy issue where batman kidnapped Robin after his parent died yelled at him with a ridiculous Clint Eastwood impression and killed cop in a giant explosion I have no idea where that came from and I can find that issue anymore It had amazing art though,Batman political alignment

420,mothman232,comicbooks,Hi everyone I wa browsing reddit while on break and I noticed some comment on Cates Venom that made me think Let me start by saying that I enjoy both the new Venom run and the New 52 Batman series even though I find the latter a bit inconsistent in place That said I wa thinking of the similarity between the two run and I am wondering if they are coincidence or not The first thing we can notice is that both writer aim for gritty and dark story with grandiose villain that threaten whole city with unconventional mean Both Knull and the Court of Owls are new creation and retcon part of the character origin story Cates is also bringing back Carnage Venom nemesis just like Snyder brought back the Joker Bruce nemesis in his second story arc The main character is a deeply troubled anti hero who usually end up winning at a high personal price Father figure have had quite a deep impact on the protagonist psyche This is something of a subjective opinion but both writer ending appear a bit rushed after the bombastic buildup that preceded them for example Venom 6 wa slightly underwhelming for me even if I enjoyed it all the same Both writer are perfectly complemented by artist that show a big Todd McFarlane influence Capullo even worked on Spawn and seem to be inspired themselves by the 90 a far a the badass element http cdn comicsverse com wp content uploads 2018 09 VENOM4 jpg in their story are concerned For example I haven read Dark Nights Metal but from what I heard it very 90 influenced plus you can deny that the dragon symbiote is pretty much something you could find in a lost early Image comic book Another thing I started to notice recently is that while at the beginning Cates Venom seemed to be universally loved it starting to get it fair share of detractor both on twitter and here on reddit The same could be said of Snyder Batman which started very strong with the Court of Owls and then started to get a somewhat mixed reception in the subsequent story arc I could probably find other thing in common but I am wondering if it all just a reach on my part or if you agree disagree and why I suppose some of these element are common for a lot of comic book but I can help but connect the two run everytime I see some new page Thanks for contributing to the discussion,Similarities between Snyder Batman and Cates Venom

443,RobinDJT,comicbooks,This is my opinion I want the old Helena Bertinelli back This the perfect time to bring her back because Birds of Prey rebirth kind off flopped and while Helena wa the not the sole reason for this there were many reason that I could list in another thread I don see where to go with the current version she is not the best character Compared to all the development the old version ha it a no brainer Pre New52 Helena She wa friend with Tim Drake She butted head with Batman a he kicked her out the JL and Barbara She later becomes friend with Barbara and Batman warms to her during Birds of Prey She ha always been on the outskirt of the Batfamily she wa involved in Batman No man land and Batman Hush always trying to get in closer To be accepted by them Now I always found this interesting because the original Helena Helena Wayne wa Batman and catwoman daughter So while the Bertinelli version had a different story she wa always connected to Batman and involved in his story This always felt right to me They are different character the two Helena Not only do they look different their history is different Their connection are different Their story are different Yes she is white but that not a problem Yes it important to have dark skinned character for representation because white people aren the only one who read and support comic but it not important to do it this way and replace an existing character with load of development It not the way to do it If the only reason not to bring her back is because she is white I think that wrong I don want to get rid of the new Helena but they can make her into her own character she ha a whole history with spyral I have thought about this way too much but I have interesting idea And if it doesn happen ok I guess I just continue reading some old story,Discussion Bring back the old Helena Bertinelli

457,Dubwell,comicbooks,Once Upon a Deadpool wa not perfect by any mean but it wa way better than it should of been and it ha me more excited for the future of Marvel and Deadpool now It also made the flaw of Deadpool 2 more evident Let me start this off by saying Deadpool 2 is my favorite of the 3 Deadpool movie 4 if you include the super duper cut The reason why Deadpool 2 is my favorite is because it wa the most comic accurate Deadpool in term of Wade Wilson being human He had real emotion and it wa great The other reason is that Deadpool 1 seemed like it wa strictly for shock value while making deadpool more like the internet version of Deadpool It wa still a good film that wa funny but it wasn my Deadpool and that ok I don expect them to make a character identical to the comic since character change and evolve with time Plus movie and humor are subjective When I heard Deadpool 2 would have a PG 13 version I wa intrigued but scared I mean how can they remove the violence language and joke Well after watching Once Upon a Deadpool twice I am really surprised with how much of the movie still worked Let look at the bad of it first though They seriously dropped the ball with the beginning of the movie The beginning wa so choppy They removed my favorite action scene they removed the blood they omitted the Logan joke and the cocaine joke which they totally could of pushed for These are problem that could been handled better The problem is they couldn reshoot the stuff and they didn plan the fight scene around a PG 13 The rating wasn the main issue it wa the fact they had to work with pre shot footage They also played it VERY safe PG 13 movie can have blood Like a lot more than they showed They also removed joke that were totally ok like the mcrib joke and the prison wallet sound fx Let get to why I loved the movie despite those flaw Deadpool acted and talked more like Deadpool from the comic He wa more meta and his joke weren reliant on swearing to be funny He wa more absurd and creative with his expletive The bleeping wa clever a hell and acted just like the swearing symbol in the comic Some of the redone joke were actually better in some case too though that is subjective Overall it just felt more like Deadpool from the actual comic This also made me so happy since it mean that Deadpool isn about a rating but it the character and the joke So many of the joke in the original used profanity a a crutch This is the flaw I never noticed with Deadpool 2 Seriously I never realized how much of Deadpool 1 and 2 were just sex joke said differently with random noun There are time where I laughed even though it wasn funny or well written but because he dropped some f bomb The problem with that is they wear off after and lose their impact after over use Once upon a Deadpool got creative with the censorship which in itself if more clever than just crude humor If they announced a PG 13 Deadpool movie now I don think I would be too upset I think they would have much more blood and violence than Once Upon a Deadpool offered It also wouldn be a disjointed film since they could film around the restriction They can take the restriction and use them a a way to get more clever joke In fact the joke would have to rely on clever writing instead of the shock value the movie seem to rely on To be honest the movie got me hyped since there is a very real chance that Deadpool can appear in mainstream Marvel movie and the movie show that he can work very well in a PG 13 Spiderpool can actually happen now Sorry for my writing style and thanks for reading TLDR In some way Deadpool PG 13 is more like Deadpool than Deadpool,Movie Once Upon a Deadpool Once Upon a Deadpool wasn perfect but it wa way better than I could of predicted

480,IamNet,comicbooks,I NEVER read a DC comic only watched the movie and some series but a friend of mine told me that Flash wally west could run 24 tredecillion time faster then light and outran instant teleportation and i wa like What well then doesnt that make him most OP superhero and then he wa like Nah he is more like a second tier hero And my mind just blew I have watched the CW series and i know he can phase so can he just phase through any enemy heart and kill them and they cant even counter him cuz he is fast a fuck boi Imagine the mass of the punch he will throw that would kill anyone with one blow Your mass becomes infinite when you travel a fast a light theoretically and let assume in the comic they can define infinite then his punch have a mass of tredecillion time of infinite That make him super OP but then why is he a second tier hero or is it because he is not BATMAN I never read the comic and heard this from a friend so i might have missed some crucial point or maybe others are more OP than him,Why is Flash not the most powerful superhero Discussion
481,someweirddud,comicbooks,tom king ha a lot of stigma and controversy surrounding him what is his stuff like he ha gotten into trouble for the 100 page Walmart special and others like that so I am wondering if his stuff is isn a decent read,thought on tom king
482,Donna201299,comicbooks,the Green Lanterns specifically Hal John Guy and Kyle These four men each fill in the same role often at the same time yet have completely different personality that make them more than just another Action Hero Hal Jordan is often cited a generic and many detractor neutral on the character say that he just a generic Silver Age Character Allow me to defend Hal for a moment here because I always seen that notion a a bit unfair Hal is often praised by modern writer a THE Green Lantern The Best of the Corps and that never made much sense to me because of how Hal character tick Hal is not a leader nor is he a follower he a lone agent a fearless loyal thrill seeker with arguably self destructive reckless behaviour stemming from childhood scar but an ethical code equal to Superman even though he slightly more willing to kill than Big Blue even if he doesn like it Outside of his heroic he an Air Force Test Pilot a job that let him literally fly solo on thrilling flight detached from the rest of the world akin to how his role a a Lantern ha detached him from the rest of the Earth more and more over the year John Stewart is very different He an ex marine a sniper to be precise and a former archaeologist both role require focus seriousness efficiency and precision all thing John ha in spade Like Hal he detached from the Earth though John is far more detached than Hal will ever be a Hal will always going back for Carol while John who ha a confessed preference for alien woman seems to go more exotic with time He orderly organised and sharp minded with a mind for philosophy and ethical debate He prefers efficiency to flashy substance hence his frequently mundane usage of the Ring he rather take someone down quickly and efficiently over a big light show Out of these four John is the one most suited to lead the Lanterns by far Hal great at solo mission Guy great in all out brawl and Kyle great at being a Wild Card One Man Army but none of them have John ability to lead Guy Gardner is complicated Most people look at him and just see the man who got hit by a bus and got One Punched by Batman and a such dismiss him a The Dumb Brute One which is sad because Guy had a fascinating history beyond being a bruiser He had two main job before becoming a Lantern a Social Welfare Caseworker and a Teacher of Disabled Children Yeah that right Guy Gardner the Lantern whose often characterised a an oafish idiotic loser who only care about himself and whose face his fist is going to connect to next dedicated his life to caring for child and inmate going through rehabilitation This alone make Guy a fascinating character a man with such outward aggression yet seems to be one of the most caring character we covered so far but we not done yet You see the reason Guy quit the casework job wa because his aggression from his teenage year wa beginning to seep out of him His teenage self wa a delinquent whose behaviour stemmed from a particularly horrible childhood of abuse neglect and failed attempt to get positive attention from his father that he only coped with through his love of comic book General Glory story to be precise A lot of people including DC if the New 52 historical rewrite mean anything choose to ignore a lot of this a Early Instalment Weirdness but I choose to use all this information a a basis for why Guy doe what he doe At the end of the day he a bitter cynical jerk with anger issue that doesn trust authority figure and love beating people up but he also imaginative loyal devoted to helping the le fortunate willing to fight to his last breath to save the universe and ha a fascinating tendency to see the best in people even if he frequently get envious of those truly noble quality He a truly flawed hero and while he actually my least favourite Lantern because of how often he just shown a a dick with none of the pathos that make him interesting beyond that I have to respect him for that Kyle Rayner is weird out of place and shouldn work a a Lantern Not a a character in a piece of fiction of course if anything his creative nature make him perfect a a user for a multi tool like the Green Lantern Ring No In Universe Kyle make absolutely no sense a a member of a Police Force operation like the Green Lantern Corps He like one of those young kid who were mandated to go to war during WWI obviously not suited for it but the circumstance forced him to However all thing considered he made the best of the situation The reason why I described him a The Wild Card One Man Army earlier wa because Kyle mind is that of a very good artist creative unique and weird This kid ha the most destructive potential out of any GL ever due to the power of his mind Hal the best solo act John the best leader and Guy the best throw down fighter but Kyle could easily take out all of them by simply letting his imagination run loose This kid even made Batman freak out once with his dangerous potential He a dork but an immensely powerful creative dork and that what make him an effective Lantern Special credit to Danny buckle,Why these Green Lanterns are more compelling than you think

509,Chronos96,comicbooks,So after hearing this series reccomended so often on here I decided to buy the two omnibus on Comixology for 12 dollar and honestly I glad I bought it on sale I didn hate it in fact I honestly read the whole series in about eight hour over three day My issue with the series and the reason I glad I got it on sale instead of paying full price ha to do more with the last few chapter After Elijah enacts his plan to kill the rest of the Four I felt like the series just lost all of it momentum The last issue where they rescue Ambrose just seemed sort of pointless and it felt like a non ending Honestly the whole series seemed more like loosely connected vignette where Ellis just wanted to show off a cool concept I mean I realize everything came together in the end but I can imagine reading this series monthly and having it make any sense at all I guess my main problem with the series is that it never felt like there wa any real sense of stake going on Elijah Jakita and Drums all felt hyper condfident and for a supposedly sinister a the four were supposed to be they didn really seem present in the story or much of a threat to begin with They were dispatched so easily I don know long story short I enjoyed the series but I honestly don get the hype surrounding it and I feel like Black Science by Remender handled the multiversal aspect better The main character were likable but not really relatable,Discussion Just finished Warren Ellis Planetary What are your thought Spoilers obviously
510,mo3ismyname,comicbooks,I am a relatively new reader compared to many people on this sub and I just need something cleared up I have been reading a bunch of Daredevil and I plan on picking up the new 1 in February I think I have a sufficient amount of Daredevil knowledge so this question isn about that I want to start reading Captain Marvel in preparation for the movie and Miles Morales spider man I know that they both relaunched recently and I am familiar with their origin and character I haven read much of either of them though and I am wondering if I can pick up the 1 and continue from there I looked it up and found nothing relevant so I am wondering if the Reddit community can answer some question for me 1 Can I pick up the number 1 and start from there 2 Is it specific to different series 3 If I cannot start at the 1 where can I start for those specific character 4 I know there is a lot of backlash online about the 1 is that because of post like these Thanks for helping me out,Question about Marvel 1
511,yuudachikaini,comicbooks,Original http twitter com TheBigBang_ status 1086034214737334273 Now where were we Ah yes the ol let wait for the big corporation to change their model of business out of the kindness of their own heart recurring discussion Real talk for all their speech of supporting the Direct Market DC and MArvel number 1 priority is themselves AND YOU CAN T BLAME THEM FOR IT THEY ARE BUSINESSES Look at DC It went from a company that wa super communicative with retailer and incredibly supporting to one that decided to give a Tom King and Andy Kubert story to Wallmart I dunno maybe they got big money for that Maybe Mr Wall Mart really love comic and wanted some exclusive But they literally cut out their number 1 partner retailer in the direct market out of something that we could sell since our customer actually know these creator It wa puzzling but just another show of how comic book store are seen by the corporation But hey we still be here to welcome them back with open arm if this thing fails Because retailer are sucker for punishment You know when everyone talk about how comic are doomed and publisher are the devil blah blah You know who the retailer online aren blaming Retailers You know whose fault it is that we have 750 million variant per month Retailers because they the one that buy them in the first place Marvel isn to blame that there are 1 in 500 variant Retailers are because year of their practice and speculation lead to this Retailers that spent their life only selling DC and Marvel and not building a diverse customer base are in danger now Because this is a different market And some are having a really hard time with it The entire situation the industry is living now There isn one single culprit It all of u The Direct Market remember we talking single issue here is a delicate ecosystem And we been in the middle of our very own Climate Change for a good while So what can we do improve thing The Direct Market NEEDS returnability We won be able to raise our order and try to get more customer in store in the current climate when we are being asked to take on all the responsibility Retailers are expected to buy all these comic from publisher buy them outright you don get to return what you don sell and then do the marketing ourselves and sell them to customer And hopefully we turn a profit THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE You not even marketing your own book comic company An ad for NIGHTWING on BATMAN isn marketing You talking to the same audience How is it that these massive mega company can market anything to save their life Retailers have to shoulder all of these different expense of the business so the publisher can make a much money a possible and we don even get treated a real business partner We are constantly asked to buy not order BUY book without knowing what happens in them or sometimes who the creative team even is That that doesn work like that anywhere else I mean I love Chip and totally get why he want to keep people in suspense DAREDEVIL 1 but I not people I a business partner and Marvel should have not kept me in the dark It business Creators should be free to create and not have to worry about marketing when they working for a corporation Corporations have people that do just that marketing Put them to use Example I love the creator in the upcoming AGE OF X MAN stuff All brilliant talented people Pre order on that are nearly zero because no one know really what is Because marketing for this is let put something on Newsarama and call it a day Those creator are fighting an uphill battle and they seem to have almost no support from the publisher What the point of releasing a book you don believe in 100 Do you want to sell it or not The company don care Because they know they sell enough copy to make it or at least not lose money and that enough Why spend money on marketing and potentially get new customer if you happy with milking the usual people for more You know why you are seeing all these announcement of new series selling out in the first 5 minute Of 2 selling out even before coming out Because publisher aren overprinting They rather not take that risk They rather YOU the customer wait week for a second printing potentially never coming back for it Retailers aren ordering a many comic a before so publisher print these thing a close to the bone Then they can joyfully announce that they sold out in record time gee whizz If you have order of 10 for an 1 and you print 10 5 because you rather get the sigh marketing bump of THIS WAS SO HOT THAT IT S ALREADY GOING INTO SECOND PTG BEFORE COMIGN OUT you not helping retailer or more important the customer If you putting out weekly series with no returnability and where retailer are buying 5 or 10 issue sight unseen You not helping Retailers are here to sell a many comic a possible but it incredible how our business partner make it so hard It really shouldn be this way It doesn have to be this way RETAILERS Join ComicsPro We have a louder voice when we talk a one No one is going to help u we have to help ourselves CUSTOMERS Keep being wonderful and spending money in your favourite comic book store Word of warning though more and more store are cutting order a much a possible and if you not there on Wednesday or have a pull list you might miss out We seen a big increase in order since we started using ComicHub Customers are definitely getting savvier about ordering comic and now we have even LESS stuff going on the shelf If your local shop ha it open an account on ComicHub to manage your order If they don it grand Start a pull list Tell the folk at the counter what stuff you into and what you want to buy all that help Again almost all the store we know are trimming order a much a possible don miss out Publishers Some of you are already amazing and we love you so much The other one let see how we can work together more We can sell more comic TOGETHER Let get into 2019 and work

517,strongerthenbefore20,comicbooks,I am getting pretty pissed at the constant trend of DC and Marvel having all of this character development and storytelling in order to make change to their character only to end up reverting them back to normal and undoing all of the character development usually in a single issue Recent example that come to mind Spoilers The most recent run of the Ultimates went to all of this trouble to turn Galactus into the Lifebringer only to turn him back to his normal played out self in Infinity Countdown Dr Doom progression into a good guy I really enjoyed his appearance in Invincible Iron Man and Infamous Iron Man and now he is back to being an arrogant villain Superman and Batman return to their underwear look Sunspot transition from being a first rate Avenger back to being a second rate X Men I don know about you but I think comic would be a lot more interesting and popular if they made change to character and stuck with them amp x200B,Why can DC or Marvel ever keep any new change

604,GrayGhostt,comicbooks,The new Green Lantern run is really good with a lot to dig into but there been one recurring comment that pop up which I wanted to discus The notion of Morrison ignoring continuity for his run which considering his great body of work seems quite an odd criticism to me The bulk of it emerges from Morrison not following up the 2 page epilogue to Hal n Pals which feature Carol and Hal embracing but there an issue there Morrison wrote his script way ahead of time and is currently working on 11 the issue meant to come out September of 2019 which is crazy ahead of time for a monthly book so what he wrote came in way ahead of time and wa all done and set in stone before Hal n Pals epilogue wa ever even done Beyond that Venditti himself is the writer that tore down the Carol Hal relationship more than anyone else Johns spent a great deal of time and effort bringing them together again and writing their dynamic and relationship wherever he could over the course of his 9 year tenure Then Venditti tore it all down in his very first issue after the beautiful Green Lantern 20 conclusion with not even a second hesitation The justification given at the time for this wa also quite frankly ridiculous I quote it here for the sake of context gt N So what are your feeling about Carol Ferris In your first issue you had Hal and Carol break up again Is her relationship with Hal something you just see a being played out or do you have plan for her gt RV I think Carol is an amazing character I love her and I feel like what happened between her and Hal Carol dump him in issue 21 is just something that I feel like a woman who is a strong and commanding a her would do And just because her and Hal are on the out at the present moment doesn mean that she doesn have a key role to play in all of the Green Lantern title and not just to Hal and the main Green Lantern book specifically Now having done this his tenure also saw the fairly awful issue where Carol who still with Kyle tell Hal that maybe they be together again which is pretty not great to say the least Venditti not only ripped apart the work Johns did and tore down the relationship but over the 85 issue of GL he wrote majority of if not all Carol moment revolve around or are tied to how Carol no longer love Hal and doe not wish to be with him You can break something that wa earned over the course of year of storytelling like that ignore it and then pretend it all fine again in a 2 page epilogue What about Carol Where is she right now emotionally How doe she feel We not given any of this a Carol thrown aside and never really used especially during the course of the Hal n Pals era We get Soranik poor turn random new OC character like Sarko get full arc but Carol get nothing What happened can be fixed via a I broke the toy here they kinda how I found them 2 pager You have to work for it you have to build what wa broken again You have to put in the work You have to earn it It why the criticism baffle me since Venditti never did that work he just utilized a fan service moment to mark the end of his era They not even together again they see each other embrace kiss and that it That not a relationship or them dating again This is all putting aside all the other various instance of throwing out continuity in his tenure from blowing up everything in the Sinestro run the true successor to Johns GL both figuratively and literally to regressing of Sinestro and more Morrison read Venditti stuff early on which is how he came up with The Blackstars a he read every issue of Green Lantern and all of Hal story alongside every sci fi DC collection he could get his hand on to build his GL run His run ha had intern going through ton of old comic to get information on old long lost character and concept The guy is the champion of everything is canon and is the guy that wrote Batman and Multiversity the guy who used Electric Blue Superman in Rock of Ages he not the one to ignore continuity His run pick up on a facet of Hal that even Johns run stated quite blatantly http i imgur com D7v60ZJ png and having spoken to Sharp about the book it about a man that very specifically been through the end of day in Johns run and having seen all that the universe ha to offer and exploring where this guy who been good bad dead everything you can ever be is right now and how he feel It brought back Eve Doremus the silver age love interest who loved Hal for Hal Jordan and not Green Lantern in contrast to Carol which is what Hal always deeply longed for It set to bring back all of his love interest and plan to examine Hal through his relationship This is a run that care deeply for continuity and history It evident when you see Morrison speak on it and Carol herself gt He ha a lot of woman Hal had a lot of girlfriend and female character he connected with over the year and we bringing them all back Carol Ferris is his one true love with spark and fire but we wanted to bring back all these different woman from his past They all have different relationship with him and they not all sexual relationship Some have a problem with him some really like him and their husband hate him we playing a lot more with this guy who appears in your life suddenly and now Green Lantern sleeping on your couch for the next week What are you going to do with him gt We want to explore all of those relationship and also all of Hal Jordan previous relationship in the book So Tom Kalmaku in issue 3 We do see a little bit of the Justice League but they been beaten They only just been beaten and Hal come to save the day And all of the female character that have been in the book we bringing all of them back and they all have very different relationship with Hal completely different approach to him gt So he surrounded by this constellation of people that I think they love him more than he even know and he doesn understand He doesn quite get it But I want to build another picture of him from their point of view We looking at all of his friend all of his lover and bringing them all back and using them a mirror Hal clearly ha a journey here a he start off where he doe Carol is his true love but he also ha this vast history with a myriad of character with whom he ha vastly different relationship and dynamic We not only getting to see Hal but the book is set to be about what Hal mean to everybody else from Oliver Queen Tom Kalmaku to even Barry Allen Barry in Season 2 If Hal ha to be with Carol again it ha to be earned it can just be a cheap 2 pager it can just not address Carol and how she feeling and where she at we need all of that A Hal that go through a great journey while dealing with all his history and then ha a heart to heart with his true love where we learn his perspective feel a lot more compelling to me and that really what we the fan I feel should get rather than a random epilogue This is a run that love and adores Hal great and rich history the team isn actively ignoring it it adding to it and building on it It why we get Controller Mu and the Blackstars a separatist sect that permit u to have Evil Darkstars without having to make the Darkstars full on bad guy a that not what that concept is meant for and in the long run it not sustainable It why we get Evil Star or Belzebeth who is a mix of Legion of Super Heroes mythology with GL mythology It how we get Volk,Spoilers In regard to Morrison The Green Lantern and continuity

615,ptolimistes,comicbooks,I start by saying something that might be controversial two third or more of all comic are bad or pretty bad About 20 25 are good or pretty good and 10 5 of comic are truly exceptional Bad comic for me are those that have pretty bad writing a lackluster story pretty shallow character and an overall lack of innovation Run of the mill action story that can be pumped out really quickly with little variation to the formula The mid range the good to pretty darn good one for me are those that have great writing great story with a lot of thought put into them or unpredictable twist intriguing character that are true to their overall identity in their own respective universe and great innovation These story for me include title like Old Man Logan Captain America Winter Soldier Brubaker Hulk Planet Hulk The Ultimates 1 and 2 Uncanny X Force Remender Kingdom Come Court City of Owls Batman Hush Batman Year One Dark Night Returns etc For me the truly great and truly exceptional comic are those that have all the characteristic of the very good one but also include some gripping thought provoking element some element that tackle a really serious theme or philosophical question I think it is this truly innovative aspect that separate the good from the great in comic book When I list some example I think you understand what I mean Watchmen Superman Red Son Batman the Long Halloween Maus Superman for all Seasons Arkham Asylum A Serious House on a Serious Earth Marvels Vision the 2016 series etc I want to know what you all think I know many who don really think too critically or reflect too seriously on these story I do though which might explain why I think so much is just garbage However the example I listed arent limited to those I named and there are many good tier comic that approach or lightly touch on the thought provoking theme I think distinguish the exceptional tier comic Tell me what you think about my evaluation and how yours differs What proportion of bad good and great do you think is comic a a whole generally,How do you judge evaluate rate the comic book story you read And what percentage of comic a a whole would you assign to bad pretty good and exceptional when it come to comic

657,Blue_Nosed_Clown,comicbooks,My main issue is with Cliff Robotman Larry Negative Man and Vic Cyborg Cliff and Larry can emote and they not too expressive in their movement which will provide a challenge when directing them Cliff is voiced by Ben Fraser who is amazing but the actor in the suit is a different guy kinda causing some disconnect which may or may not prove to be in it favor making them a little off putting Vic face plate is suppose to be integrated into his flesh There no real way for that to gel well And these show are getting a low budget Probably especially Doom Patrol for being so niche His body tech look like a shirt Might look better in motion I more wondering why he in the Doom Patrol since A he and Cliff sorta have a similar storyline with they humanity being interfered by the integration of technology sometimes even losing themselves to it Don know where they take his story arc But why can he just be a Titan Beast Boy still ha a connection with them so I wouldn be surprised if he switch over in a later season Crazy Jane is a Wild card since I don know much about the actress and her ability to portray multiple personality disorder She seems a bit moody teen hope to get a better grasp the more I see I do have faith in the direction of the show going with the semi pulp horror theme with the manor and the character Like in the original during the silver age And they like an old timey family taking group picture having dinner together etc Also they going with the mental heath root it seems since they were always character with mental disorder and deformity Cliff wa a amputee full body Larry wa in reference to burn victim Rita Elasti girl now Elasti woman probably to differentiate from the Incredibles which wa a reference to the Doom Patrol My Greatest Adventure a forgotten actress The writer seem to be going into body dismorphia which would be interesting What do you think Excited Pissed Don care I love this team so any publicity is something I happy about,Whats your impression on the Doom Patrol promotion

810,shablam96,comicbooks,Hear me out So my basic idea for Captain Marvel 2 Captain Marvel A Force or Captain Marvel Alpha Flight is that the Kree come for the Inhumans in Attilan and capture or murder most Then someone be it Maximus or a Kree set off a Terrigenesis bomb that creates the NuHumans on Earth The Kree then kidnap a bunch of these including Kamala So say Medusa wa the only Inhuman to avoid capture She Carol She Hulk and some other female character who had people close to them kidnapped team up to rescue the Inhumans from Kree enslavement Among the kidnapped Inhumans is Kamala Ms Marvel She lead a group of the NuHumans Inhumans to try and escape and they almost get out Anyway the A Force arrive and help the rest escape and defeat the Kree The end happy ever after setting up Kamala for her own spin off or lead in a Young Avengers Champions movie I know it unlikely heck I wouldn be surprised if Kamala wa made an Eternal or Mutant instead but given Captain Marvel too wouldn be until 2022 anyway I feel there enough room for damage control let the Inhumans rest before they get a decent version in the MCU Also side note I could totally see Kamala being used a the new young superhero a by that time Peter will likely be in college out in the world Only wonder is who would her villain be co a far a I know she hasn really got any,As bad a Inhumans wa I be fine with a rebooted version in the MCU

839,dancing_goldfish,comicbooks,What ha been your impression of Marvel year My personal opinion wa that it suffered from being a transitional year between Alonso and Cenulski A lot of the first half of the year felt like treading water waiting for the relaunch we knew wa coming We got author doing alternate reality or future storyline rather than anything substantial with the character Most title peaked in 2017 and fizzled out in early 2018 Bendis jumped ship and his book wound up Cap wa stuck in a weird post secret empire limbo where nobody wanted to talk about secret empire So he went into the future a did Laura Other title got stronger ending such a Mighty Thor and Amazing Spider Man The second half of the year wa probably a rebound with a lot of title getting stronger with relaunch Personally I enjoyed it le than most reviewer but then I not the audience for the whole back to basic approach I more interested in Miles Riri Amadeus and Jane Thor and found the return of Tony Odinson and Banner a bit same old same old It all felt le exciting and more average to me That said plenty of people found a lot to like in the new Hulk in particular and Spencer Spider Man show promise Coates Cap look to be dealing with the post Secret Empire fallout that everyone else wa too nervous to touch I characterise the Thor relaunch a boring but pretty but there no denying it pretty And Cates Venom is getting some hot review though I personally haven gotten much from it yet So overall I say that Marvel rebounded a bit with fresh start even while I personally am le interested and looking more toward Image and smaller company I haven mentioned the X line much because I struggling to characterise their year It felt kind of chaotic I feel like a bit of the X momentum from the previous year wa lost both Gold and Blue felt like they lost focus a bit and neither really built to a climax Tom Taylor X Men Red started massively strong out of the gate but probably needed to be bimonthly because it felt like it lost momentum and kind of drifted into an early retirement The Hunt for Wolverine felt badly managed with too many inconsequential mini that went nowhere and Return of Wolverine ha so far been pretty lacklustre I don read Deadpool but so far Skottie Young seems to be exciting people le than Duggan run I guess this sound negative but there have been positive too Writers like Kelly Thompson Donny Cates Matt Rosenberg have reinvigorated the writing pool a bit and others like Coates and Spencer and Ewing seem to be consolidating and improving I think more than anything we need to see some long run on book to let them really develop Anyway those are my off the cuff thought How about you,Marvel 2018

882,pingedme,comicbooks,Just something that ha been bothering recently As much a comic tend to either ignore or downplay it Many of the biggest Superheroes have taken a life sometime in their comic book career Yet despite this comic tend to ignore or downplay the potential consequence of such an act at least when the act isn being used to sensationalize a event Or at least shy away actually going through with the act So my question is Under What Circumstances Should a Superhero Kill Not Kill a Enemy Or what make killing acceptable and can a Hero still be looked up to when that happens To be clear I do not want Heroes to turn into killer for the sake of shock value I do not want Heroes to be interpreted a ruthless Anti Heroes Nor am I advocating for any Watchman esque deconstruction for the Superhero genre I am trying to get some opinion on this particular matter and try to get a better understanding on how death killing should be handled,Under What Circumstances Should a Superhero Kill Not Kill a Enemy
