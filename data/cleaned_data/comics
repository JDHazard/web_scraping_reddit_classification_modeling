8,fantasticox,comicbooks,I might be on a limb here but I genuinely feel like these early book are dropping a heck ton of momentum that HoX and PoX set up There a whole world here that is so interesting ton of possibility and a literal blank slate for every book Jonathan Hickman ha made irrevocable change to the status quos of Fantastic Four and Avengers and a larger part of the Marvel universe so it weird to me that given his coming to the X book and also given that a fresh new era of X book that will likely be a basis for happens in the MCU Given the weight of all of that why are we getting book like X force where the Professor dy it ripple out to every book for barely an issue and then with almost effort they bring him back Books like Fallen Angels that get a chance to provide u a non problematic Psylocke and make it the most boring thing on the planet Books that completely ignore decade and decade of hot take and and history of character to just write exceptionally lesser version of these character Marvel ha some of the best writer on payroll in the industry right now and they giving these book to some of the worst The only one I think is really doing something special is Marauders to be honest I fuming about this but I also hope I not the only one,Spoiler Discussion WTF is Dawn of X editorial doing

66,bardbrain,comicbooks,I realize Bendis is ALWAYS hazy with timeline but Jessica wa in Peter Parker high school class Meaning she graduated circa the comic released in 1965 and had to discover her power before that The first super villain she fought wa Scorpion Scorpion wa wearing a costume closer to what he wore in ASM 29 1965 than what he wore in Captain America 122 1970 and wa committing a petty theft a opposed to his somewhat grander crime in 1970 My best guess is that she debuted sometime after the wedding of Reed and Sue Richards and probably circa the first coming of Galactus and the Kooky Quartet era of the Avengers but before The Vision debuted Havok or Polaris joined the X Men and Kree Skrull War We can infer that she wa freed from The Purple Man circa Avengers 177 based on Jocasta presence on the team and the reference to just returning from space The Korvac Saga As to the length of the Purple Man control I guess it depends on whether you take the 8 month literally or in Marvel Time Classically in Marvel Time at five year to one that place her abduction by Purple Man roughly concurrent with Giant Size X Men 1 and the Jackal cloning Spider Man I kind of buy that a it represented a period of the Marvel Universe getting darker with the main problem being that Carol Danvers recognized Jessica and didn debut a Ms Marvel until 1977 That strike me a where you have to treat the timeline a hazy since there barely time for 8 REAL LIFE month between Carol debut a Ms Marvel and Jessica recovery Then again I think there relatively little issue backdating Carol origin However I don think you can interpret Jessica four year career a Jewel to be four REAL WORLD year because it too tied to Spider man timeline IMHO she had to have been active well before 1974 Thoughts,When wa Jessica Jones Career a Jewel A bit of analysis

78,Spaghettiprincess,comicbooks,First off dispite being heavily interested in politics and having strong oppinions on related subject a long a the story I am reading is well done I really dont care about Undertones or jab being thrown in here and there It make thing topical sure but I read comic for a story period If a story is good then I don care if a charater sound like a stereotype you can see on the news Second off I LOVE Neil Gaiman Sandman I love the Lucifer and Books of Magic series too So when Sandman Universe came out I wa stoked I have enjoyed all branch of the series so far except for one House of Wispers I wa originally really excited about this title It is new It focus on mythology that I am not familiar with and I love all of these series because I am so into mythology The story ha been okay so far But just that OK With a lot of the other connected title There wa this really clever natural way that the various creature and mythological device get explained So even if you are not aware of something in particular you ted it enough to enjoy the story That sort of happens in House of Wispers but not a well It also make it harder to follow when many of the conversation bubble are in creol or French I really do appreciate adding that in there to really make it feel authentic i think thats the right word but it is some time to the point I just feel like I am missing chunk of dialogue thats wa okay though There were some really cool thing going on in the book cool plot point I wa still down There were some social political undertone in the story I wa fine with a lot of it It usualy fit the character made sense or had some relevance to the plot There were a few time though thing just felt like they were there for no reason Didn seem to connect with anything I rolled my eye and kept reading Then the orphan girl and her cat came in the picture In this story arch there a typical orphan with shit surrogate parent with only a cat a a friend The problem with this wa one it wa unclear where this wa happening The parent had a Spanish last name but spoke with British slang Then she run away riding on the back of her now mutated cat friend The cat friend try to eat her but she basically say swiper no swiping and the cat decides to not eat her and help her instead They end up and a closed down immigration facility She make some comment about whatever country she in being a shit hole and it only hope wa the immigrant it shit on that wa blatant I get the character ha been abused But based on her abuse I dont really think she would even be aware of much of the world considering she wa locked up being a servant in these people house for most of her life It just felt like lazy writing and a really loud political comment that wasn even clear what country it wa directed to It felt sloppy House of Whispers ha not been my favorite story in the Sandman Universe It been real it been fun but it hasn been real fun And if sloppy politically charged writing is going to make it way in to an already not spectacular storyline I dont really care to hear the rest of it,First time quitting a series because of political overtone

133,DunBanner,comicbooks,When Conan 2099 wa announced I wa looking forward to it with extreme caution My only exposure to Marvel current Conan line wa Gerry Duggan first 5 issue story arc on Savage Sword of Conan Reads much better in the B amp W TPB It wa by no mean a great Conan story but an enjoyable Conan v Wizard type of story with cool Ron Garney art swordplay and sorcery and Duggan capturing the character voice perfectly So I went in expecting a Conan story but not enthused by Conan in Modern time aspect of the story Thankfully Gerry Duggan and artist Roge Antonio make it work for the part Conan is in the Modern Marvel age ruling a king in Mexico and when he is accepting tribute from his subject an altercation with a witch make him cursed a an eternal wanderer Duggan melodramatic narration and dialogue really capture Conan characterization a stubborn against any challenge and also show his guile in dealing with the curse I think it a good story for Howard Conan fan and it show to new reader that the character is more than just a one dimensional brute Roge Antionio artwork is good he doe bloody action scene well which is a must for a Conan story but I wish the background were more detailed Erick Arcineiga colour make the art work IMO with garish cyberpunk look for 2099 and earthier colour in Conan flashback I also liked how Conan wa well integrated into Marvel Universe despite my reservation against it and I wa unfamiliar with 2099 mythos and other Marvel titbit reading about it added to the overall enjoyment of the story That said there were a couple of nit pick which sometimes made the story detail feel muddled For instance Conan is ruling a king in the modern age yet his subject wear and live like medieval time Also despite living and adventuring in the present and 2099 Conan still wear a freaking loin cloth in contrast to the original Howard story where he wore appropriate clothing depending on his need and geographic preference I hope writer ditch this loin cloth stereotype a it is just tiresome at this point Nevertheless a good story art and an ending that capture Conan a the quintessential adventurer really make this comic worth reading,Conan 2099 is surprisingly good one shot comic but is also confusing

146,SoSorryOfficial,comicbooks,I been catching up on G Willow Wilson excellent Ms Marvel run lately and it had me thinking about Marvel character that exist primarily outside New York City It always kind of surprised me that we don see other distinct location develop their own microcosm of super more There are plenty of location that are specific to particular character or group but they never seem to flesh out enough to sustainably host multiple story at once For instance in the recent Ironheart series you get individual Ironheart story in her hometown of Chicago but she not running into other Chicago hero and villain like say Spider Man might run into Daredevil and team up against Kingpin or something I could see how it might be hard to really establish a location to the extent that it self sufficiently generates story when everyone already invested in the more NYC centric Marvel universe but it not unprecedented in comic Consider for instance the distinct roster of character in Gotham versus the one in Metropolis It exists somewhat with the Marvel UK stuff but not much else I guess what I trying to say is could it be baked into the DNA of Marvel comic that New York so dominates it setting that other location end up just satelites instead of hub In a world with mutant science experiment gone awry magic alien etc you think LA or Chicago might also have it own distinct metahuman scene of hundred of people let alone massive city outside the US,Discussion Marvel Outside NYC

160,MaskMakerDollar251,comicbooks,Doomsday clock will come out tomorrow 18 12 2019 on store wich will also mark the end of the series event and hopefully will give u the resolution around the state of the time line of the dc universe and in general of dc comic itself having read it to this point I confess that while I liked this story there ha been something that made concerned about I talking about possible spoiler the commedian return and the way he wa brought back from the dead Initially I wasn shacken up by it because I wa hopefull that Geoff Johns would have adress that issue in a way that would have been respectfull to the original work of Alan Moore maybe by making Doctor Manhattan create two separate reality in which one Blake wa saved by him and another where he still died for example But we reaching the end and to this day he still hasn addressed it yet and I worried that he won at all Now I not losing my hope on Geoff Johns just yet after all we still have one issue left and the internet say it will be a long issue My howeve is this based on what he do about it his action will affect Watchmen in term of acceptance from the community based on my subjective interpretation on the subject I think he can settle the issue with the following option Making two different reality a I mentioned at the beginning of the post leave it a it is by which I mean leaving the commedian alive in the dc universe which can still work because the original world of Watchmen will come undone for this but the original story will still exist putting back the commedian where he wa in the fall and erasing his memory of the experience I had to make this last point very clear because is the crux of what I trying to explain the very worst thing that could happen is if the writer decides to put him back to where he wa but with the memory still intact Because that would give Blake something to cheer on before diyng knowing that Ozymandias plan came usunder after his death That would give him hope And hope is the foundation of the Dc universe not of Watchmen Watchmen wa a story set on a world where hero needed to let go of their moral principal their thrust in the system and their hope of a better tomorrow and take the law on their hand to carry their justice on the world doing whatever wa necessary even murdering innocent So putting the concept of hope in a world like this would clash with it atmosphere making the tone inconsistent Not to mention that it would make Ozymandias an actual villain when he wa more like the antagonist of the story he may had killed innocent people but he didn do anything different from what his other collegues did in their career He wa still a hero doing everything he could to save the world The reason why I expressing my concern is not for my sensibility because even if the worst happens I could still treat it like a separate thing same a other older reader What vorries me is that when new reader will give Watchmen a try after they read Doomsday clock while some can treat it a a separate thing like me others will be left confused or won appreaciate the story for what it is which is a deconstruction of the superhero genre becuase Doomsday clock will influence the tone of the story And that all I want to say I don expect to recieve prize for this post since it could be percieved a an unpopular opinion but I hope we can all have a peacefull and respectfull conversation and that I not alone in this,Possibly unpopular opinion I think Doomsday Clock could possibly harm the quality of Watchmen

206,SageRadioX,comicbooks,It wa first published in those anthology book sold at Wallmart and I afraid it will never get the recognition it deserves because of that A girl is kidnapped in Gotham But not by the usual villain One day an alien life form simply abducts her for no apparent reason No one know where the girl may be in the universe No one know who did that There are no lead to follow There no guarantee that the girl is even alive But she might be and if she is she might be scared and hoping that someone anyone care enough about her to rescue her So Clark drop everything he ha on Earth and go up in the sky not knowing how much time it will take or if he can succeed to look for this missing girl that can be anywhere in the cosmos On his way Superman ha to face trial a physical a a boxing match to a spiritual a a Faustian bargain and everything in between Throw in some occasional surprise like an unexpected crossover with Sargent Rock and this easily became one of my favorite read of the year Sadly the only attention this story ever got wa a minor controversy caused by a chapter showing many death of Lois Lane which sparked another talk about fridging in comic It couldn be more unfair It basically Superman overthinking thing and imagining what kind of tragedy might have happened with his loved one since he wa away In the context of the story this stressed out and homesick Superman even come across a funny This is a story in which Clark expose his opinion on humanity and the world during a casual talk about food with a child It deserves better than minor controversy Ah and Kubert is at his peak too The boxing issue and the Sgt Rock crossover look fantastic Honestly I am willing to swallow a couple of Heroes in Crisis if Tom King continues to deliver comic like this It reminds the reader why and how King rose so high and so fast,Tom King Superman Up in the Sky is fantastic

310,bserum,comicbooks,You may be familiar with Tom King suggestion that influential contributor get co creator credit http www cbr com batman tom king creator credit oneil adam englehart rogers miller I kind of agree but I will say that creator too strongly implies originator which can lead to misinterpretation and confusion Instead I nominate defined by a a suitably reverent and all inclusive term Thus in Tom King example gt Batman defined by Bob Kane Bill Finger Denny O Neil Neal Adams Steve Englehart Marshall Rogers and Frank Miller But whereas the traditional method of identifying authorship is fairly straightforward whoever name are on the credit page of a character first appearance King asks for a more nuanced evaluation of credit But this can get complicated and subjective It call into question what constitutes a character in the first place I LOVE this question it one I given some thought to I suggest that a character is defined by 4 distinct facet I made a diagram http images2 imgbox com 84 aa 6d4NL5y7_o jpg Entity Both perfunctory yet integral this refers to the character individual self It is the basic element that make Jack Kirby and Joe Simon Bucky the same character a Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting Winter Soldier Whereas each of the other three trait can change dramatically the continuity of consciousness creates an indelible link to it previous incarnation Design The fundamental visual appearance of a character It the property that allows people who look nothing alike Adam West Michael Keaton Val Kilmer Christian Bale and Ben Affleck to disappear into the iconic entity we recognize a Batman Characterization The personality and attitude of a character defines the choice they make and the way they respond to the world around them Though possessing identical power set the contrast between Plastic Man lighthearted frivolity and Mister Fantastic intellectual seriousness illustrates why character relies on characterization Worldbuilding Transformative event exposure to chemical waste loss of loved one etc and individual element Hell Kitchen a Batmobile Kryptonite etc can become so tightly integrated with a character that they become associated with and an extension of that character So let me apply this to a character like Wolverine Wolverine is an excellent example of a character that ha been developed significantly since he showed up a an antagonist in Incredible Hulk 181 182 He stemmed from a concept by editor in chief designed by Marvel art director fleshed out by a writer who had just a few issue with the character developed dramatically over decade by another writer with a selection of other artist and writer contributing here and there Here is just one guy take on who defined Wolverine with totally arbitrary percentage because I have a OCD urge to quantify everything Chris Claremont 40 Logan name claw a part of body Adamantium reinforced bone healing factor mysterious backstory character development Len Wein 10 mutant animal sens ferocious attitude Government agent John Romita 10 original costume claw John Byrne 10 brown amp tan costume variant advanced age war veteran Alpha Flight Dave Cockrum 5 distinctive hairstyle Gil Kane 5 iconic cowl Barry Windsor Smith 5 Weapon X background Paul Jenkins Joe Quesada Bill Jemas 5 James Howlett name youth background Roy Thomas 5 Wolverine name Canadian Frank Miller 4 Japanese samurai background Bob Harras 1 Wolverine 75 writer Larry Hama ha reported that he wa against the idea of bone claw so I guessing it wa X Men editor Harras that conceived it bone claw,Influential contributor to character should get credit

412,Cole-Spudmoney,comicbooks,I need to rant a little bit about this there a difference between a character popularity among reader and their popularity in universe and it irritates me when comic writer confuse the latter with the former It something that come up in a couple of series that I otherwise really like Geoff Johns run on Aquaman is great it doe a really good job of relaunching the character taking a lot of inspiration from his Silver Age backstory but updated for modern storytelling standard But the character had that whole Aquaman is lame meme following him ever since the Super Friends cartoon so Johns decided to directly reference and refute that in his first issue First time we see Aquaman he stop some criminal making a getaway on the street and they all like Aw man we got stopped by Aquaman That so lame We never live it down Here the thing though in the DC universe no one going to think that Aquaman is lame The Super Friends cartoon doesn exist in this universe and Aquaman is a public figure a Justice League founder and one superhero among many others that have le impressive sounding power than his or no power at all I can easily buy Aquaman being unpopular in universe but that be because he come off a weird or off putting or confusing not because people don take him seriously Another example come from James Robinson Starman with the character Will Payton There one flashback issue set during Will time a Starman which begin with Will doing an internal monologue about how no one seems to like him and also feature a villain doing a long villain speech about how Will suck a a hero because he got no edge Now I have no idea if Will Payton wa an unpopular character or not at the time but I can believe he wa because he wa a genuinely altruistic and wholesome hero who got invented very soon after The Dark Knight Returns established that Comics Are Dark and Serious and For Adults and They Called Graphic Novels Actually Personally I like Will Payton for pretty much the same reason I like Captain America and I think that disliking him because he not edgy is like getting mad at Steve Rogers because he isn Spider Man But again I read all of Roger Stern run on the Starman series with Will and in universe he wasn unpopular For the most part he wa just obscure because he wa a new hero who mostly operated in the city of Phoenix and around the rest of the American southwest and he wa a popular hero among the people who knew about him As I said Robinson Starman is one of my favourite comic series of all time but that whole You unpopular because you have no edge thing doesn feel like something that honestly come from in universe it come off like Robinson using that villain a a mouthpiece to talk about why he himself doe not like Will Payton,Discussion When comic book get too meta about their character
413,kmone1116,comicbooks,Starting to get burnt out on reading your average Marvel and DC comic So I looking for something new for example I wa looking to pick up Paper Girls Super bonus if a series feature gay main character or mental issue Pretty much just trying to expand my reading horizon,Looking for some non super hero suggestion
414,ReallyJerrySeinfeld,comicbooks,So after finishing up Hellboy and meandering through B P R D and Watchmen I think Im ready for one of the big name and I think batman would be perfect for me Any other DC title would feel too intimidatingly connected to other story but Batman seems I don know how to say it perfect I thinking I might pick up the Long Halloween and I know it not a beginner thing but Killing Joke ha always been a bucket list story Is there any story this subreddit would bring to my attention that I should definitely read for a good time Also should I read Year One BEFORE Long Halloween or doe it stand on it own pretty well I heard it described a sort of a sequelish to Year One so that why I ask,Trying to get into Batman what are some good story to read for starter

475,jordan999fire,comicbooks,I feel like story telling wise Marvel DC Image Dark Horse or whoever if they want to start a extended universe or year down the line if they want to do another need to do it via TV Like I use DC for example because that is my favorite comic company If they instead of doing the DCEU gave a huge budget to HBO or another big channel that allows pretty much anything and told them to make a Batman show then after one season of that doing a Superman show etc etc that would benefit way more Than do it similar to the Arrowverse where once a year they all crossover and we have like a Justice League episode Then year in the future all of the show could end at the same time and a new show could start that would be the Justice League I feel like the only benefit movie get is the budget and the audience But if they gave a TV show a really big budget and it had good enough writer to pull in a big audience than we would get 1 More in depth look at the character 2 more world building 3 More character 4 More story Like I don think they could ever do every Robin in a movie universe I think the very minimum of that you could do is 4 movie Batman solo through half the first then getting Dick him having Jason and Dick in the second one but Dick leaving at the end Jason dying at the start of the third one time jump now he ha Tim and fight Red Hood fourth one we hear that Tim ha left Batman and Damian show up but with a show you not only could have every Robin but you could flesh them out you would probably have to make them older like 17 when they start with Batman except Damian This would also benefit villain a lot They could have a lot of reoccurring villain that we end up loving like Gotham did with Riddler Penguin and Jerome Jeremiah and we can have them live up to their comic book counterpart better and actually seem like a threat v something that get dealt with in a few day like in movie Marvel would benefit from this too We could actually have a whole season of Tony Stark being an alcoholic and then something happening where he ha to change and in the next season he is battling with it mentally We could have smaller hero show up such a a Punisher and Spider Man episode of Spider Man A Moon Knight episode of Black Widow And with show depending on how big they want to go they could give all of those smaller character show too maybe with smaller budget or animated or even just 1 season to really develop the character It make the world feel more lived in,Discussion Shows Would Benefit Comic Books More Than Movies

494,Enochlived,comicbooks,I think comic book in America began their downward spiral back in the 90 They caught on with gen x in the 80 and so the production value and the price of comic book started going through the roof In the 80 little kid could afford to buy comic book but in the 90 they price got over 4 buck each Instead of dot matrix printing and cheap newspaper grade paper comic company started using thick glossy page and expensive printing technique and because of the cost involved they started devoting their resource to established property rather than experimental comic and new writer But then during the Obama admin comic book were reduced to political propaganda Comiuc book have always had political overtone superman wa originally based on Neitzsche philosophy for example But now they started engagin in blatant propaganda like have Obama on the cover of spiderman etc That tactic of using comic book strictly a propaganda broadened to where it is now with comic just being horrible extreme left trash and writer getting hired strictly for their political view looking at you zoe quinn and story just being woke garbage Meanwhile the Japanese were still cranking out good comic book and so the crowd that used to read comic book ha switched over to manga While American comic are only concerned with making superman black and batman a tranny kodansha is still publishing thing like Attack on Titan which is a good well written manga amp x200B Will the American comic book industry ever escape the hand of the ultra left propagandist or is the current state of the industry just the last for gasp of a dying industry,Will American comic ever rise above their current sad state
495,aiggebe,comicbooks,This is a very specific question about numbering that been bugging me for a while now why did Ultimate Spider Man skip 149 The final issue of the original numbering is 133 the Ultimatum arc then it relaunches with a new 1 This relaunch continues until it reach 15 and then we get a double sized 150 Except that doesn equal 150 If the book had never been relaunched and continued with the original numbering what wa once 15 would now be 148 _not_ 149 Now I know _why_ Marvel did this because comic book numbering is a joke and they wanted to jack up the price for an milestone issue without waiting another month But wa there any official explanation Did they decide to count the Super Special 1 that about the Lizard I know Marvel and DC grab whatever they can to pump out anniversary issue every year like how Superior Spider Man original run wa counted a Amazing Spider Man issue But at least those use _something_ to pad out the numbering right I know this is a very specific question about a long cancelled book and an issue that would come out nearly a decade ago but it always been so odd to me I apologize if the answer is widely known or if this wa all complete gibberish,Why is there no Ultimate Spider Man issue 149

543,kappakingtut2,comicbooks,I got some huge issue with Zack Snyder But this isn about me and that all beside the point According to the cinematographer they only used about 10 of Snyder footage So from a fan of the movie making process that make me very curious to see how different they are compared to each other His version and the final theatrical version So many people hate that movie already releasing extra stuff about it wouldn make people hate it even more Too late for that And from a business standpoint Snyder ha some ravenous fan who would gladly throw money at anything with his name attached to it So Warner Brothers ha nothing to lose by releasing it either If it were up to me I would release one massive box set Similar to Terry Gilliam Criterion Collection version of Brazil One disc had his version of the movie the other disc had the theatrical studio cut version of the movie and a third disc with all of the interview and behind the scene secret I would love to see a full on documentary explaining exactly what happened with Snyder and the Justice League,I can believe I actually saying this God forgive me But I actually think they should release the Snyder cut

596,thewonderelf,comicbooks,This is very long TL DR at the bottom Some background I been reading comic since I wa a kid I in my 30 now but never had a store in my area One finally opened when I wa 13 and I wa so excited to have my own pull list and chat with the store employee about my favorite book Fables and Ed Brubaker Catwoman at the time And then I hit puberty Suddenly the owner started making inappropriate comment to me touching my shoulder or my wrist asking for hug etc He even gave me his phone number at one point But there were no other store in my area so I just made sure I took a parent with me when I picked up my book Once I had my own car I wa able to make excursion a little farther out to other shop I thought the thing with my shop wa just an anomoly While I never had an experience quite a terrible a the one with my first shop it soon became clear that a a teenage girl I wa not welcome in any shop I went to UNLESS I wa willing to flirt with whatever dude wa working My sincerity wa questioned I wa mocked my purchase were made fun of I put up with all of it because I loved comic and I wasn going to let a few asshole ruin my passion for me When I left for college in a medium sized city the first thing I did were locate the library and the comic book store It wa a small shop crammed with long box of back issue upon back issue And to my utter surprise and bafflement the older guy working there greeted me with a genuine smile asked if I wa a new student and gave me a tour of the store He asked about what I liked and we found out we were both really into Elf Quest He wa at least 30 year older than me but treated me with respect and kindness I wa broke and couldn afford to maintain my pull list but over the next few year I went in whenever I had a little extra money to spend Even if I didn buy anything it wa so nice to just chat to Bruce not his real name about what wa new and hear his story about brush in with comic celebrity After I graduated college and got a real job I went in and set up my pull list Since then Bruce and I have become genuine friend We play a tabletop RPG together and still nerd out about Elf Quest and now Giant Days He just an all around great dude who know his stuff Unfortunately the store isn doing well which I known for awhile So the owner made the rash and poor decision to fire his most knowledgeable most well loved employee who I sure wa also the most expensive I could be wrong but to my knowledge he did not attempt to change strategy or enact any other cost saving measure It may sound petty or vindictive on my part to break up with the store over what amount to a shitty financial situation but I can over emphasize how important it wa for me a a young nerd to find a safe welcoming comic space Everyone who work at the shop is nice but no one is a knowledgeable considerate or well loved a Bruce And no one else went out of their way to welcome me and make me feel at home So I made a tough choice and cancelled my pull list I be signing up at another local shop that ha made great stride in hiring woman and POC employee in recent year But I super bummed that it came to this and that my friend lost his job in such a crappy way It feel kind of like an actual breakup TL DR I wa sexually harassed and made to feel unwelcome and or unsafe in every comic shop I visited until I found a great shop staffed by an older guy who wasn a creep and made me feel welcome I been going to that shop for 15 year now but he just got fired because the shop not doing well So I broke up with the shop and it feel like I broke up with a romantic partner,I just broke up with my comic shop of 15 year because the owner fired the first person who made me a woman feel safe and welcome in a comic shop

599,howicallmyselfonline,comicbooks,TL DR at the bottom So year ago I loaned a bunch of comic from my old library and the art style and setting still fascinates me I really want to find this comic series back The only problem is the library moved and in the process sold off a lot of book I haven been able to find them I looked online for age but have yet to find the series What I do have is reference to similar styled artist and somewhat of an idea of the setting Perhaps people can help me find this elusive series First off I don know where this series come from or how many edition there are but I know from what I read that there is at least more than two volume to this series My guess is that it is a French comic From what I can recall it is about a blond sleek haired boy that at some point need to sneak into a strange medieval town The whole setting is somewhat absurd with lot of character wearing mask and a general carnaval esque magic feel to it all Also everyone seems to be able to tell that this kid is the only human in the world that it all play out in and him being discovered a being a human wa an important driving plotpoint The closest semblance I found in drawing style is the work of Jean Batiste Andreae Also the setting seems to resemble his work on Terra Mechanica except the style of the comic I am looking for is a little le realistic than the work of Andreae and a bit flatter in shading and brighter in color What I remember is that it also look like the flatter style that Jean Giraud Moebius used to draw in I searched all over the web but have failed Perhaps you mighty reddit hivemind can helo me find this comic I would he forever grateful TL DR loaned a comic book in the past cannot find it anywhere anymore Likely French based on similar drawing style and general story setting About a blond boy in a medieval carnaval esque world in which he is the only human,Trying to find a comicbook series that my old library sold when they moved Please help me find it
600,Donna201299,comicbooks,Anyone who is a Comic Book fan and ha been reading comic for a long time know that comic book artist and writer weren always treated the best anyone who isn sadly doesn know what went on behind closed door For most of the time comic book character have existed the actual business itself ha been marginal money wise DC comic didn mention Superman creator Jerry Siegel or Joe Shuster for decade and the lawsuit filed by those two to get the right to Superman back wa settled after they both died and in DC favor Bill Finger wa practically erased from History before Family member and friend had to fight a huge legal battle just to have his name credited a co creator of Batman Martin Goodman the publisher of Timely comic didn give a shit about comic He sold Marvel in the mid 60 when they were in their prime simply because he wa tired of it and had no idea what artist like Stan Lee Jack Kirby Steve Ditko and the others were accomplishing The entire staff basically had to ask for their job back with the new owner Ever hear of Batman Superman Spider Man Ironman The Hulk Yes even marginal fan may know this now but most people until very very recently weren even marginal comic book fan I feel this made it easier for these company to take advantage of their creator The one example that get to me however is what Leah Moore said about Alan Moore on twitter Now I know Alan Moore get a lot of shit for being a cranky old man that hate everything and doesn understand how the world work but the is an interesting read The idea that the man who loved superhero story so much he gave up his job and plunged recklessly into writing comic which at that time wa insane of him to do loved them so much he filled every panel and arguably every balloon and caption with that love loved them so much he tried to make them into something that provoked thought and feeling that addressed issue that spoke to people the way superheroes had always spoken to him That seems crazy to me I have his collection of Marvel comic dogeared from reading from love His problem wa that the medium he adored wa ruled by corrupt despot that the people who made that magic were abused that their contribution wa not valued that it wa stolen from them He already hated that before Watchmen He already knew Kirby had been shafted To see him dismissed a Crazy Old Alan Moore again and again and people not know what made him that way To see people dissing him when their job their industry their medium wa partly built on 40 year of his hard work I am not heartbroken just really fucking disappointed Can you imagine if he hadnt been fucked over If instead of being Grumpy Alan Moore Shouting From His Cave he had spent the past 40 year putting out book after book for DC and the rest Creating vast world full of the superheroes he love Enjoying comic Its a damn shame And from the interview itself in a section which could really do with being shared at least a much a the post Scorcese comment I afraid that for a few year now I have felt that since I am apparently not allowed to own the work that I created in the same manner that an author in a more grown up and worthwhile field might expect to do and since my protest at having my work stolen from me are interpreted by a surely young at heart and non unionised audience a evidence of my grouchiness and cantankerousness then the only active position that is left to me is to disown the work in question I no longer own copy of these book and other than the earnest creative work that I put into them at the time my only association with these work are broken friendship perfectly ordinary corporate betrayal and wasted effort Given that I will certainly never be reading any of these work again and that I have no wish to see them or even to think of them it follows that I don wish to discus them sign copy of them or indeed have anything to do with them I want to ask what your opinion on this subject is and ha the industry evolved from how it wa in the past For any comic artist or writer here Do you get fair compensation for your work,Has the treatment of Comic Book Artist and Writers Particularly Industry veteran gotten better

664,BTDnspace,comicbooks,It aggravating saying people always calling book that they don particularly like or that actually aren really well written a fanfiction I understand the connotation is that when that phrase used it mean that the writing is amateur and non professional but almost none of the character at Marvel or DC are written by their original creator anymore and haven been for decade Any writer writing for one of the big two company these day is doing so because they love the character and the world and are fan enter inspired by the decade worth of story they grew up with if someone wa not a fan of superheroes why would you want to write comic book for dc or marvel in the first place well unless maybe your Garth Ennis,Criticizing Marvel or DC comic book that you don like a fanfiction is absurd

687,Fucoui,comicbooks,This essay is what the title say and I don want to turn this into another moral crusade post so I stay up front this isn about justifying piracy I don it can be justified because it isn a just act and I think people who do pirate and seek comfort in that act should really just get over themselves and accept the fact that they participate in a small harm That being said what many comic creator and others are essentially stating in their argument against pirating is the poor people should be functionally barred from participating in culture because they cannot afford it which is essentially punishing people for living in poverty They are not offering advice to better increase access to comic book in legal way so that the poor can actually participate in culture they are not offering way in which the industry could eliminate piracy in a non punitive way and if you want to utilize the wholly broken criminal justice system to punish someone who stole a comic book essentially ruining that person life then you aren a good of a person than you think you are they are simply stating do not do this I poor I been poor and better than you This isn a a moral stance a many seem to think it is I been actually poor not man freelancing is tough can believe all the shit I have to put up with after graduating from art school and making comic really rough out here way but I two day away from homelessness and absolute poverty I starving and I need a way out way and in a my parent can afford to buy me anything to entertain me with so I steal it because being bored and poor is worse than being just poor nihilistic way During the second mentioned time I had virtually zero legal access to art outside of the library which I frequented but it wasn the perfect solution because of various issue I sure most people who dealt with library are familiar with This is in absolute term a societal moral failing not on par of homelessness in seriousness but of a similar far lesser failing We all in one way or another participate in a system that both fetishizes the power of art whilst also at the same time limiting access to it either through monetary mean the comic industry problem and through epistemic mean which also tie back into economic disparity and class but le of a problem for comic because that are designed to be working class art for working class people This is essentially the argument comic professional are making a deeply conservative one that both undermines the general value of art it important and people should a a right have access to it and really only punishes poor people through the regurgitation of conservative talking point This is not a good argument not for stopping piracy nor from increasing the access to comic and art and their own well being it is simply supporting a terrible status quo for the benefit of the corporation they all work at So what can be changed I state here I no longer read comic beyond a few book a year House of X and Power of X being the big one this year because I been completely priced out of the hobby and while I wished I could get down to the library more I can reliably get there because of issue of transportation time and energy poverty eats away at both of the last one and cause the first one I don torrent or download comic which might surprise people here given this essay I just don participate in the culture anymore beyond reading review and looking at preview because I can afford it But when I wa younger I did still them after I couldn afford to keep up with the weekly price or the bus fair it costed to get to the LCS so I stole it This is the crux of the issue of piracy framing it a a personal responsibility issue neither help creator or get rid of piracy All it really doe is create site of justification by pirate So once again what can be changed First we need to recognize that their are essentially two group of pirate those who will won stop pirating and really don give a shit you call them bad or wrong or killing the industry and functionally unreachable and those who literally can because issue of poverty or access or geography and so on I think it a mistake to confuse one for the other because all you doing to is turning the second into the first With that out the way what can be done about the second group A number of thing that are more suited for the betterment of the medium than telling them they are horrible people and are literally killing your child or some shit for downloading a infinitely replicated digital file I going to offer a number of argument that are more favourable for everyone from largest in term of scale to the smallest 1 A literal revolution that fundamentally change the fabric of our society so that worker including the pirate and the comic professional don need to either submit to a work place tyranny or starve to death and provides basic standard of living for everyone so those who want to spend the effort and time on art can without worry about starving and those who don want to pay for it don have to This is will not happen in our life time but it still a better argument than yelling at people on the internet either buy my book you actual filth 2 Utilizing the current government system to better fund art through public grant and other various method that give artist a livelihood that isn directly tied to how well a rigged economic system sell there book I would also propose this only be tied to creator owned book corporation should provide a basic standard of living for all individual they hire or they shouldn exist Again very unlikely 3 A union literally a union so that piracy doesn effect the bottom line of comic professional I know most comic professional unfortunately think like small business owner instead of worker but union have demonstrated to increase living standard across the board in a industry even for those not apart of the union 4 Destroy the direct market make comic cheaper and various other way the industry itself can change to not only make comic more affordable but make it more accessible which in turn would help out creator We see comic outside of the direct market flourish be it manga European comic or YA graphic novel 5 for creator owned comic utilize pay a you want which I used in pas creative endeavor and surprisingly most people paid the price ceiling and those who couldn were incredibly grateful or other pricing scheme or start a patreon or other crowdfunding but not Kickstarter because they are deeply anti union source supplement your income that will help eliminate the second group of pirate 6 lastly do a you are now Just yelling into the void of the internet If the goal is to destroy pirating and I agree it is then there are much better way than what is going on right now No amount of moral grandstanding is going to end the problem and I doubt anything ever will but there are better solution that just grandstanding,Poverty access to art and pirating

722,irenepanik,comicbooks,Hello fellow fan Over the year I employed different method for setting the mood right for reading comic book Be it setting my phone to silent or in the old day leaving the phone of the hook stocking up on snack work better now that I reading almost exclusively digital getting in my favourite chair or just making sure I have no obligation left for the day One thing that really set the stage for me and that I employed more and more over time is listening to music while reading I found that movie soundtrack can often elevate the immersion and experience to a great degree One of my favourite soundtrack to go with is the soundtrack to The Bourne Identity It both tense and beautiful Works well for most action and suspense comic like Batman I recently rewatched the movie and wa struck with that I come to associate the music with Batman Another one more bombastic and perhaps better for event comic is the soundtrack for The Rock by Hans Zimmer But it a bit uneven especially the Jade track in the middle of an otherwise pretty tense feel Do you do this What do you listen to,DISCUSSION Music while reading comic

765,AreYouOKAni,comicbooks,I am very stringent about the franchise that I enjoyed when I wa a kid Like Terminator ended with T2 Alien 3 never happened The Matrix wa a great solo movie you know the type of guy So consider me shocked when I read Verheiden comic and really really liked them If you have never heard about Mark Verheiden he worked on Superman and Phantom wrote the script for Jim Carrey The Mask created Timecop comic movie and show developed Constantine for NBC and Daredevil for Netflix But back in 1987 he wasn that big yet In fact Aliens wa his second comic book after The American miniseries Aliens Outbreak Nightmare Asylum and Female War Aliens Outbreak by Mark Verheiden and Willie Shubert http preview redd it 2b41dbx8lm141 png width 1280 amp format png amp auto webp amp 8b9e7cbb736b55a58ef8df7856af88f359c32e74 Verheiden wa the first guy to write Aliens comic book before him we had only an adaptation of the original movie And let just say that he knocked it straight out of the park The story pick up with Newt and Hicks after the event of Aliens because of course they didn die It been a while Newt is almost eighteen now and both of them are still really fucked up after the event of the movie Except that it not over and when the xenomorphs do come back the Colonial Marines need someone experienced to lead the expedition The actual story is a lot more bombastic and throw our hero all around the galaxy Without spoiling thing it very high octane gritty and fitting into the world of Cameron movie And yes we do get the closure on Ripley in this alternate universe and while it is somewhat fanservicey I find that it work The book do not shy away from the PTSD both Newt and Hicks are experiencing In fact both of them are often barely holding on to the real world and don turn into big damn hero with Batgod plot armor In fact the book is mostly about failure and character almost have to pay for theirs The art in Outbreak is a classical four color style common for the 80 but Willie Shubert is a good enough artist to make it work The two sequel have a little different more modern They are not bad but I find that I like the old school design of Outbreak better amp x200B Aliens Nightmare Asylum by Mark Verhaiden and Denis Beauvais http preview redd it f982d2i5mm141 png width 474 amp format png amp auto webp amp dfeac94be0e7db9d34b84ba183a3b0daa22c8cec DIFFERENT VERSIONS When Alien 3 released Dark Horse went into the Big Brain mode and tried to adapt the already released story to the movie continuity Newt became Billy Hicks became Wilks Ripley became a synthetic android clone of herself it really unclear and the story turned into a horrible mess Even the Aliens Omnibus vol 1 contains that version of the series and it just bad However the new Aliens The Essential Comics vol 1 http www comixology com Aliens The Essential Comics Vol 1 digital comic 69203 contains the original version with slightly cleaned up art You do miss out on Theory of Alien Propagation a pretty good lore book on xenomorphs but the upside are worth it CONCLUSION It may be nostalgia talking but I love these story They are a little campy and maybe not a dynamic a modern blockbuster but god damn it they are thrilling and fit this universe so damn well It a must read for all Aliens fan MY SCORE 8 10 Not bad for a human

amp f5c0602c011c7e7b08c28a53b5af251c3baf2f38 With Aliens Outbreak taken care off Verheiden picked up another high profile franchise from 20th Century Fox Predator Concrete Jungle came out in 1989 almost a year before Predator 2 It also doe the whole Predator in the Big City much better than the second movie Our hero is detective Detective Schaefer OK his name is not Detective it just all everyone ever call him Originally the character wa supposed to be Dutch now working for the NYPD but something fell through and comicbook Schaefer became Dutch older brother The brave detective Detective is investigating the gang war in NYC and trying to figure out what happened to Dutch in when an alien or to be exact a predator drop in the middle of it all and paint the town red Thus begin the worldwide journey that will take Detective to Russia and Guatemala looking for his brother and trying to understand what happened to him The comic is brutal dynamic and move really fast On the downside it not a cerebral a the movie with Predators being more in line with their later appearance than the Monsters in the Shady Wood Most issue are pencilled by Ron Randall with Chris Warner doing some art in Concrete Jungle It old school and overall pretty good Dark River ha much smoother coloring which actually kinda work too even if I rather the trilogy had a more uniform artstyle amp x200B Predator Dark War by Verheiden and Ron Randall http preview redd it e0mnxmc5ym141 png width 1100 amp format png amp auto webp amp 84bc63ca20763a1a1987f5c6f0788ff7ca72a456 There are a lot of way to collect this series including the recent Predator The Essential Comics vol 1 http www comixology com Predator The Essential Comics Vol 1 digital comic 692102 But really anything will do neither the art or the script changed in the release CONCLUSION It good even if not completely great However it above and beyond the rest of the Predators franchise aside from the first movie And it really really fun if you enjoy brutal action movie from the 80 It probably won pas the Bechdel test and it not all that politically correct but it still really good MY SCORE 7 10 This stuff will make you a god

856,trover2345325,comicbooks,Earlier I talked about about hard reboot that will put an end to both DC and marvel long running convoluted continuity with an ending and replace it with a hard reboot filled with reimagining of the character and original one every once once in 5 6 year with a fresh continuity from beginning to end However not many people are invested and interested with the idea for various reason amp x200B Many people think that it will cause lazy creativity which I thought might give artist and writer more freedom to create their own take of their own dc and marvel universe with a beginning to end or at least with a showrunner Many people are invested in the character and the long running continuity removing that will make everything wasted and felt that they are doing this for nothing Both marvel and Dc still use the current continuity and character without end for their profit especially that they are considered a their crash It wa believed that this idea would make the comic book sale much worse resulting in another comic book crash And lastly many people prefer huge continuity and back story in both DC and Marvel main comic rather than story with a beginning to end But what happens if DC and marvel decided to do a hard reboot anyway but becomes a success If it doe here what happens Many people will still think that this idea is controversial but later understood that it a good idea a the old one will live on a mascot and continue a standalone and non canon story a second imprint While the main line will only consist of hard reboot continuity with a beginning to end A mixture of old and new version of the character in both Dc and marvel will appear in crossover for an anniversary special but non canon or semi canon to celebrate the company success evolution and history Both new and old version of the DC and marvel character in different continuity will appear in video game Books made by marvel and DC aimed for kid will still start the old version of the DC and marvel character wince they are the mascot of the company And lastly there will be film or television adaptation adapting each continuity of the DC and marvel universe from beginning to end So if I belive that the hard reboot of Dc and marvel is a success then such thing that I explain will likely happen,My perspective on what happens if the hard reboot in both DC and marvel main universe will be a success in the comic book industry

929,LostWorld90,comicbooks,I think it about time I quit comic book in general Why It simple Majority of comic out there don even try to use all the creative tool that using both visuals and written word give them For example if more comic were like Sandman Overture in the way the art tell a compelling a narrative a the rest of the book a well a fit with the narrative and serf a a new level of understanding for how the story should be interpreted then I read more But I keep getting disappointed by comic book consistently I just picked up Brave New World by Adlous Huxley and I realizing that most comic book are picture book They don use visuals to show the under lying characteristic of character most of the time and the art is often film inspired retread even though comic book don have the audio visual atmosphere of movie because they are comic Most comic don even challenge your mind on implication and emotional depth Another problem I always had wa Super hero Like how many super hero book do there have to be There are big action franchise out there don get it twisted But for comic the two giant of the industry cater to only that audience A lot of indie comic are good but also fall into the lack of art that actually help tell the story in a unique way category often Looking at you SAGA Maybe I pick up a few graphic novel once or twice but from now on I back to being a book lover because at least I can find book that actually are complex use their word to create atmosphere beyond the surface level and actually give an emotional response I been reading comic since I wa 8 year old and it been over 10 year and I only now realizing half the shit I read isn even half good a reading The Phantom of the Opera or The Storyteller by Jodi Picoult ANyway that wa my rant,I think I might be quitting comic book soon

946,dracosadra723,comicbooks,Now I wa originally gonna post this on a subreddit that wa dedicated to Superheroes but the sub wa pretty much dead Also this is not to convert you into liking a certain type of hero but rather to understand their importance So I pretty sure that people here at this subreddit love superheroes Comics are the home of Superheroes We have gotten many superheroes that have affected our culture over the year like Superman Spider Man and Batman You have most likely heard many scholar talk about how superheroes are our modern American mythology and I couldn agree more But lately we have been getting a surge of a certain kind of hero and have seen a decline of another certain type of hero Now there are many sub archetype but I am only going to be talking about the two main type of hero and those two type of hero are the Aspirational and the Motivational hero Let establish what those hero are The aspirational hero are hero who don need a multi layered reason a to why they became a hero they become a hero because it simply the right thing to do They don have moral failing nor do they or should question their aspiration This type of hero is obviously in line with hero such a Superman and Captain America People usually say how the aspirational hero are unrelatable but the thing they aren supposed to be relatable they can be relatable but what is more important is whether they are inspiring The motivational hero are hero that have a multi layered reason to become a hero Like for example Spider Man who became Spider man after watching his uncle Ben die because he failed to take action and do the right thing These character have flaw and mess up from time to time We have been getting more and more motivational hero than we have been getting aspirational hero and the aspirational hero like Superman and Captain America have been deconstructed to be more of a motivational hero The thing is that we need aspirational hero a much a we need motivational hero because aspirational hero are their to set the standard of what is truly good Spider Man need Captain America to aspire to be that good without the aspirational hero the motivational hero are basically lost in what they are striving for because they don have a standard to aspire to Don get me wrong we need motivational hero to show u that it is okay to fail and that even though we fail that we must never give up what we are aspiring to do So that is the importance of aspirational hero they are there to set the moral standard for motivational hero I want to know what you guy think,The importance of Aspirational hero

996,ragecndy,comicbooks,So I been randomly arguing with myself about this but I think the biggest problem with superman fighting almost anyone is he can theoretically speed blitz EVERYONE like he could do the same he did to shazam in injustice to most character if he wanted I even remember he blitz lobotomized doomsday in some episode of the justice league cartoon he could probably do the same with guy like hulk thanos etc I think only actual speedsters and cosmic aware reality manipulator would be safe it kinda ridiculous if you think about it kinda break all his story too cause you have to have him holding off to explain why he doesn punch a hole through everyone in one mili second plus the fact that no one should be able to even touch him even if they were strong enough to do damage and I know there are guy that have crazy speed when traveling like Thor but I don think most of those do the speedster style thing were they just move freely and time stop Inb4 even guy that could take a punch could have their eye poked out and stuff like that,Are there non dedicated speedsters that could keep up with superman

998,jordan999fire,comicbooks,So a lot of people I know really hate Superman He isn my favorite comic book character not even in my top 10 but I never disliked him I actually find his part in huge event to be my favorite part Like in DCeased I loved him in DCeased But so many people I know just can stand him They usually can stand him for these reason 1 They say he is too OP 2 They say he is too happy and cheery 3 They say he is boring So a a fun little thing I would like to say why these are wrong Not saying you have to like the character by any mean but I have always found these argument to not be good I know a lot of comic character that I don really like that others love because I just have no interest in them Let begin 1 Superman isn that OP He is when you compare him to other hero but any hero can be OP given certain comparison People act like Superman only fight giant robot or car thief But he isn A lot of the people Superman fight either have kryptonite or something along those line that weaken him or they can use magic which also weakens him Plus I always found this argument weird anyway Every hero beat probably 99 of their villain If you random pick up a Green Arrow comic or Spider Man comic do you really think their is a possibility of him dying No Heroes don really have a chance of dying unless they make it a big event It at least on the cover if not also in the name of that issue Plus it not really ever about for pretty much any character of if they win but how they win Same applies to Superman On top of all of that Superman might not be easily killed but that doesn mean he can still lose He may beat the villain but what if the villain wipe out all of Metropolis 2 They plenty of comic where Superman is more serious and dark But what make Superman Superman is his hope He inspires hope Even when he is scared Even when he is worried or upset He inspires everyone around him to keep fighting But Clark Kent a plenty of moment in comic where he feel more human and like a regular person and I personally like him being more happy DC like to have a lot of darker and sadder hero Superman being happy make for a good contrast Same reason I like the Titans Teen Titans Young Justice some Flash stuff Same reason I like Spider Man in Marvel They are just fun character 3 Alright Call the comic lame call him a boy scout say whatever but boring That just make it seem like you aren that invested in the world of DC A lot of the battle Superman get in involves the entire city or the fate of the whole world They are hardly boring Hell even one of my favorite comic series I could understand someone calling boring because it seems like it is 90 dialogue Rebirth Deathstroke but most Superman comic I can really seem to call boring Maybe I am just picking up the really good one I don know but I have yet to read one and be like Could have not bought this,Discussion I never understood people dislike of Superman

1215,Donna201299,comicbooks,I am a major Hank Pym fan and I have been for a long time It started with a fascination with his awesome power but I began to relate more and more to this tortured genius though lauded a perhaps the most creative genius in the MU he is the forgotten Avenger the much despised hero I have always admired what a tragic and complex character he is between his relationship with Jan his fellow Avengers his progeny Ultron and yet he is always striving to better himself despite any and all setback He ha a passion curiosity and sense of duty that could rival Richards Parker and anyone else Unfortunately Hank Pym ha been one of the most ill treated major character in comic history His only solo ongoing ha been Tales to Astonish He almost had an Ant Man ongoing in 2003 under MAX but it wa cancelled prior to first issue while Scott Lang get to be the first Ant man with an ongoing In recent year it seemed writer have tried to sweep Pym under the rug of Avengers history his status a a founding Avenger seemingly lost upon most people or uncomfortably pushed to side by others I had long since accepted that to get my Pym fix I would have to be patient and grateful for what I got I happy I received the fatherly teacher from Avengers Academy the leader in Avengers AI and occasionally a true Avenger in the crossover and event that have included him When the rumor of an Ant man movie were first beginning to rumble I wa ecstatic to think that Pym would get to be on screen and a the MCU kicked off I held onto the fragile hope that he would get his due and be a founding Avenger on the silver screen Instead we get Hawkeye and Black Widow What more it seemed that Edgar Wright had decided that the second Ant man would be the one to be in the movie while Pym is relegated to being an aging figure with his glory day far behind him To add salt to the wound the great Tony Stark is now the creator of Ultron in the MCU with not even a hint towards his true origin traded for a little more spotlight on Iron Man The OGN Rage of Ultron wa an excellent read a well put together story with an immense focus on Pym demon As a Pym fan I couldn have asked for a better story that is until the way it ended I can help but think this is Marvel way of handling the Pym problem Get him out of the picture and allow Lang to supplant the Ant man legacy all for the sake of the MCU Hell post Secret Wars we may find out that it wa actually Tony who headed the Ultron project while Pym acted a his lab assistant if that The point of this rant is that I just kind of frustrated over the treatment of a character I really enjoy I a fan I have little to no say over what writer choose to do with these character but I can help but feel angry over a character that I grown particularly attached to I fear for the future of Hank Pym Though certainly nothing in comic is forever I feel a though a certain damage ha been done to the potential of this hero I long since given up the battle of explaining to friend who are movie goer or people new to comic who the real ant man is who the real inventor of Ultron is who this forgotten Avenger is Who know maybe RoU is just a sign of good Pym story to come but a a fan of this harrowed hero I learned to be skeptical In any all case Hank Pym is a hero and he is the Avenger I will always feel the greatest connection to despite all else,The Future of Hank Pym in the Marvel Universe

1231,Jake_CouldBeComics,comicbooks,Superman giving up his secret identity is only logical for a character who stand for truth and justice It can be Truth except for the truth of his identity and Justice because Superman isn a liar He doesn hide thing from people That not who he is And so far I seen only two consistent argument against Brian Bendis having Superman reveal his identity to the DC universe The first is that it been done before and never stick Okay sure this ha happened in the past even the recent past but that doesn mean it can be a meaningful story today And if you quick to compare what Bendis is about to do to what another writer did five or ten or twenty year ago just remember those guy were recycling the idea a well But that okay What matter is how the story work for today and whether there a chance of something new coming in the aftermath And if you think there not going to be something new and surprising after this reveal you simply selling Bendis short The second argument is that Superman need the Clark Kent identity to protect the people he love Why In 2019 Jonathan Kent is a young man who can very much take care of himself Lois Lane is considered one of the most dangerous woman in the DCU even without Superman to protect her Who else doe Superman have to shelter by being Clark Ma and Pa are long dead Jimmy Olsen is so clumsy he somehow danger proof It can be a question of logic because logic fall apart when you remember Superman civilian disguise is literally a pair of glass If you think logically about that gimmick it just seems silly albeit in a charming way that most people love regardless of whether it make sense So why else doe Superman need to hide Why should he continue living a a constant contradiction of his own moral code Look I love Clark Kent a much a the next fan but maybe it time to set that gimmick aside and let Kal El be the most super version of himself one with nothing to hide,Where Superman is concerned Truth and Justice shouldn come with an asterisk

1248,ausernameofaperson,comicbooks,I think it important to remember that the world is complex and that you may not understand it a well a you think One shouldn make generalization such a Gotham is my city One shouldn assume everything is under your control but you also shouldn assume everything all bad a Bruce doe later in the story until his conversation with Dick at the end This is something I feel is important to remember when dealing with politics and knowledge of the world around u It help prevent the level of close mindedness we see all the time while I not trying to go all enlightened centrism on y all while I don think all side are equal morally I think we can all be around equally guilty in term of close mindedness It interesting that Bruce denies the Court Of Owls in an effort to not let his emotion guide him on a case when that exactly what he doing It show how we can think we being rational when we being the opposite Overall the story an example of how comic can have real world relevance even when they aren overtly political in nature The great thing is this message is also equally relevant to one personal life,I think Court Of Owls ha a really relevant and interesting message

1302,kon-el99,comicbooks,I mean he Barry Allen adoptive potentially biological father so it seems kind of odd that he been entirely absent since DC Rebirth started The character wa always kind of underdeveloped but I always thought there wa a lot to play with I get that Henry is out of jail now but Frye gave Barry a home and a purpose when he wa at his lowest point I could really see Barry and Frye having a relationship akin to Barry and Joe in the TV show but the character seems to have been brushed under the rug Why do you think that is Do you think there any chance we will see him again Would you be interested in Frye returning Come to think of it Henry ha also had very little screen time in the comic recently so I am hoping that Williamson doe an arc soon that address the elephant in the room,Any idea where The Flash character Darryl Frye ha disappeared to

1332,mcm123456,comicbooks,My pick is Northstar from the X Men His sexuality is generally the thing people always associate him with but his power level is very underrated The guy is a speedster without being one of those broken DC level one but fast enough to be a danger to most marvel hero His speed exceeds Quicksilver generally flying at Mach 10 bu once been theorized that he could fly at 99 of the speed of light 186 282 mile per second 299 792 km If that speed wasn good enough he also ha photokinesis He can generate from his body a bright white light equivalent at maximum intensity to half million foot candle The good thing about that power is that even if a character is durable enough to resist the force many would still be blinded stunned Quicksilver is generally seen a being on the upper end of mutant power level and Northstar can do what he can do and more Who do you find to be underrated in the power department,Who do you think ha the most underrated underused power set

1389,shonenhikada,comicbooks,I mean it often pretended upon the reason they don want a character change is because it somehow break that character backstory but yet are ok with changing other aspect of their backstory costume personality if it make said character more edgy and cool And the rebuttle by many fan is just make a new character but a it is shown many new character do not do well and get lost in obscurity a reader don draw towards them preferring to read back the same hero that have been around for decade New original big two character don sell book and almost never stick around more than a year or so They just can compete for popularity against character that have been building their fanbases for 50 or 60 year Example Anyone remember a few year ago when he made some new hero including a wheelchair bound one No Because it wa barely a blip And that wa Stan Mutherhuggin Lee And the funny thing is comic book reader have no problem in changing a once establish straight female character into a gay bisexual woman see wonder woman or Harley Quinn for example but often always have problem with making a mainstream male character gay even though we know in comic thing always get reset later on,How come comicbook reader tend to be very homophobic

1693,s0naux,comicbooks,Hello all I a first time poster in this subreddit I looking for the name of a comic I bought when I wa kid during the early mid 90 Visually the art style wa like earlier Judge Dredd comic What I can remember of the comic wa there were two dukedom cult fighting each other for what I think wa some god figure The one cult wore red helmet with a single pointed tip similar to the god like figure The other cult wa more bulky and wore green colour Both constructed these strange mechs which housed multiple people There wa also a subplot with one of the royalty figure having a child that wa a demon this demon hid it form from them pretending to be a human baby The atmosphere wa very dark sci fi fantasy closest thing I can think of is 40k chaos cult Hope one of you can tell me the name of this obscure comic,Trying to find a comic book from my childhood
1694,ApolloDawn,comicbooks,I wa thinking about maybe grabbing a trade of emerald city seems like a year one equivalent Other then that i not sure I have a huge interest in the other story unless they absolutely needed I reading his aquaman right now and It fantastic I really trying to get into to dc so any suggestion for starting point on flash shazam and wonderwomen are welcomed a well,Can I read the Geoff Jhons Green Lantern Omnibus with no prior reading
1695,Cole-Spudmoney,comicbooks,I read Geoff Johns second run on The Flash with Barry from Flash Rebirth through to Flashpoint Then I went back and read the last part of the previous volume starring Wally from issue 231 to 247 Then I went back again and read the series Flash The Fastest Man Alive with Bart a the Flash followed by the All Flash one shot The beginning of Flash The Fastest Man Alive is just dull The story is dull the general setup is dull Bart roommate Griffin is such a jerk from the start that you have to wonder why they even friend and it no surprise at all when he becomes a villain Bart himself is drained of all personality his only distinguishing feature is his encyclopaedic knowledge which isn a personality trait The series start with Jay a the main Flash and he is automatically more interesting than Bart is to the point that I rather be reading a series about him instead The series doe pick up a little once Bart commits to being the Flash but only because it get a sense of direction all those problem are still there The series get a boost of energy in issue 9 when Marc Guggenheim take over a writer but it too little too late a he had to have known when he began that Bart wa gonna die in five issue time Bart is finally written with a distinctive voice but unfortunately it Wally voice his status quo isn anything like what Wally would be doing so the series is distinctive in that way but he still sound like Wally But I did kind of enjoy these issue then come 13 and Bart death is just really unsatisfying He didn need to die in order to stop the explosion so I don buy him being at peace with it when it happens And I don buy the Rogues killing him either and especially not killing him and then immediately panicking about it and trying to pin all the blame on Inertia I heard that Wally return wa supposed to be bad or mediocre but I really don see why Yes Mark Waid arc The Wild Wests isn a good a the best of his earlier long run but it still good I put it on par with his work from around Presidential Race through to Hell to Pay I actually liked the inclusion of Wally kid here more than I liked the inclusion of Superman son in Tomasi Superman I think because Iris and Jai share the same amount of spotlight that Jon get all to himself and there a bit more variety about it with Iris a the bolder one and Jai a the quieter one And I really liked how both their power were different because their developing Speed Force connection were expressing in different way I thought that wa pretty creative Anyway the series stay good after Waid leaf It doesn end with a bang but not with a whimper either more like gliding to a smooth stop Then Flash Rebirth come along and ruin everything Its attempt to convince u that it is so much better than what came before just end up making it so much worse with how desperately Geoff Johns want Barry Allen to seem cool He created the Speed Force so that make him important and therefore cool And he got a tragic backstory now The bowtie weren actually his fault Central City is edgy Can help but notice his wife Iris Allen is suddenly de aged about twenty year too to be the same age a him Meanwhile practically every character cannot stop shilling Barry and talking about how great he is the first thing Jay say is Barry Allen made me the Flash which just made me think What No The only dissenting voice is Bart and the fact that his criticism of the whole situation are so accurate yet get ignored make it feel like Geoff Johns saying Geoff hears ya Geoff don care Then there what this miniseries doe to Wally and his kid Wally suddenly doesn have that balance in life between being a superhero and fatherhood that he had in his own series he ha to stay home and be the dorky beleaguered dad so that Barry can look le dorky by comparison Meanwhile Jai ha suddenly morphed from a quiet nice kid to the most horrendous little brat on the planet while Iris sorry Irey ha become a lot more whiny and wilting then Irey somehow steal away Jai Speed Force connection which turn her from a character with her own distinct power set to just another speedster But hey she get the Impulse name possibly to ensure Bart stay Kid Flash the way Geoff Johns arranged it and I hope she enjoys it a she is written out of the series along with her family and is never seen a a superhero again By the way yes I know Geoff Johns wanted to write a secondary title called Speed Force about Wally and his family and Bart until it got cancelled because of the New 52 But given what we know about what would happened in it Jai becomes a villain a the new Turtle and probably fulfils that premonition about Wally One of your child will destroy your life I honestly think we dodged a bullet It rather have nothing than have Jai West get Superboy Primed The Dastardly Death of the Rogues is easily the best part of the run with Barry because it stop trying to tell u that Barry so great and let u actually just see him in action And okay Barry himself is still kind of bland but his new status quo is interesting in it own right And there that beautiful Francis Manapul art to look at so I don even mind the decompressed storytelling that much Overall I like this story for much the same reason I like Manapul run on the New 52 Flash series judged on it own merit it work I also thought issue 7 with Captain Boomerang wa enjoyable and 8 with Reverse Flash wa interesting Then Road to Flashpoint come along and poor Geoff just can help himself he right back to shilling Barry at u and insisting that he so great and the most important and bestest Flash evar There something kind of symbolic about the last time we see Wally West before the New 52 erased him it in the penultimate issue and he tell Barry Before I knew your secret I hoped the Flash wa Barry Allen which anyone who read Born to Run know is a complete lie then when Bart run away in a temper Wally is about to run after him but Barry stop him and insists No you stay I run and go instead Flashpoint is a weird story because it sits kind of halfway between being a Flash story and being a DC universe wide Crisis tier story The core of the thing is about Barry but that make up surprisingly little of the whole the rest is all subplots and cameo around the wider world of the alternate timeline that ultimately don even add up to much Maybe if they had more time before the reboot then more of the stuff that ended up in the tie in miniseries would ended up in the main event and properly tipped it over into being an actual Crisis Speaking of the tie in I have some thought about the miniseries Flashpoint Kid Flash Lost I thought it wa really well done and you can tell that Sterling Gates like Bart a lot a a character but I have certain problem with Bart apparent death at the end I understand why they did it and rebooted the character entirely for the New 52 because Bart with his history wouldn have fit at all in the new timeline but it still gall me that it happens in a tie in and isn even referenced in the main series Not only that but his death is entirely to give Barry a boost The issue try to frame it a a triumph and sure it better than his first death but all it doe is drive home how everything is now about Barry Barry is all all is Barry Barry Barry Barry,Discussion Thoughts after reading The Flash from the One Year Later relaunch through to Flashpoint

1774,501id5Nak3,comicbooks,So for my history seminar class the topic of the day wa anti totalitarianism So our teacher assigned another student and I these two reading packet on Monday The other student had Koestler and I got George Orwell The reading packet came with a part of Orwell Nineteen Eighty Four Specifically the part where O Brien is questioning Winston Smith and go onto explain the philosophy of the Party To those who have not read Nineteen Eighty Four that contrary to Smith original assumption the Party doe not use power a a necessary evil to rule over the weak and inept mass Instead the Party cling to power for power sake A thought occurred in my mind about something Then O Brien talk about how freedom is slavery and slavery is freedom In this part he state that if a man is independent he will always be defeated a death is the ultimate defeat O Brien say in order to not suffer this defeat man must give up any sense of freedom and individuality by joining the Party In Oceania the Party is the body and all of the people in it are it cell When one dy another take it place Next O Brien asks Smith about how doe a man asserts his authority to another Smith answer with By making him suffer which is the correct answer Finally O Brien go onto a spiel about how the Party plan to strip away any positive emotion such a love with negative emotion such a hate They plan on further transforming Oceania into a civilization based on fear rage triumph and self abasement The Party want to basically dehumanize the human race and transform them all into glorified puppet because God is Power As I wa reading this I actually began to wonder whether or not Jack Kirby had read Nineteen Eighty Four in the past and thought about using it a a template for Darkseid and Apokolips because of the uncanny similarity I noticed For starter the Party basically wish to eradicate free will in Oceania just like Darkseid want for the universe Apokolips and Oceania both fear and revere their leader despite how cruel they are towards them The Party want a society where fear and cruelty are the cornerstone just like Apokolips already ha O Brien even say that the Party wish to take away child from their mother after birth which is similar to Granny Goodnesses orphanage If anything Apokolips is if Oceania had already achieved those goal Granted Nineteen Eighty Four is not an obscure novel a it ha influenced many work that criticize totalitarianism That and Kirby wa no stranger when it came to anti fascist comic I began to look for any evidence of Kirby being influenced by Orwell and his novel but found no evidence whatsoever Before anyone criticizes me I well aware that I just probably making an assumption based on some similarity I noticed If anything it most likely because both Kirby and Orwell borrowed element from Nazi Germany when it came to designing their respective totalitarian dystopia It also likely that writer following Kirby also borrowed element from Nineteen Eighty Four Sort of like this panel from Final Crisis 5 amp x200B http preview redd it lthzdwvofrv31 jpg width 1789 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp b77bf82883d6084b0286e63434953b8b0a0f0e08 I showed my teacher who ha little knowledge regarding Kirby Fourth World and he admitted that it likely Morrison could have used Nineteen Eighty Four a an inspiration for this panel Especially with him admitting that the line Judge others Condemn the Different and the slogan To die on the job is to die for Darkseid are not too different from those that the Party would propagate The philosophy of the Party reminded me about why Kirby made the Anti Life Equation take away free will because Kirby believed that the opposite of life wa slavery In Oceania the populace are nothing more than slave who can even subconsciously think different without being grabbed by the thought police and taken to Airstrip One Again I fairly certain I just making an assumption but still the similarity are quite noticeable if you relatively familiar with both work,Two and Two make Darkseid
