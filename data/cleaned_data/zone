1,neads1,TwilightZone,Doing a marathon here of the original series This one had me gripped I know it a TV show yadda yadda but watching John Denver play a great character rubbishing superstition only to be scared out his wit and ultimately facing his doom His journey through the park reminds me how I felt having to do it late at night so many time myself Paranoia such a bitch Amazing episode definitely one of my favourite,The Jungle S3 ep 12
2,Ethan_ML10,TwilightZone,I didn really like the kick the can one,Whats your least favorite episode of the original series

4,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Picture this if you will a young lad in his 20 who saw brief flash of a zone at a young age Scarred for life he now digging through the past and hit the bedrock known a The Twilight Zone And now I guess he go to a lab and analyzes the mineral composition or whatever that is this review And I called it The Groan Zone What the heck is wrong with me Enjoy amp x200B I love Anthony Freemont I think he a real fascinating character A lot of people write him off a the spoiled godlike dictator that everyone in Peaksville fear but I don think that totally fair In Jerome Bixby original story we get to see more into Anthony mind a watcher of art we have some level of mind reading too Sometimes he go into the grove and play with the animal bringing them nest and water and such At one point he cornfield murder a sleek furry thing ferret for thinking about attacking another li l critter It not out of malice Anthony just doesn realize that animal need to eat and they can just expect him to materialize soy dog or whatever Even when he force a rat to eat itself that only because Aunt Amy doesn like rat in the basement and he trying to do her a favor He probably doesn even realize he broke her brain We see some of this in Serling adaptation a well It clear he framed more a a villain in the Twilight Zone to bump up that spook factor Literally the first thing we learn about Anthony is that he a monster But there still a strange childishness to everything he doe that lends a very particular brand of charm He make a gopher with three head and other funny animal On television night he ha this little plastic dinosaur movie with great effect too if Odyssey of Flight 33 is anything to go off of He doing the whole town a huge favor by making TV in a place without electricity And at some point he wonder why other kid won play with him It oddly isolating having everybody constantly praise you and tell you how great everything is Basically what I getting at is that Anthony is a child He might be an omniscient omnipotent little mutant but he still a child darn it In the original story the fear doesn just come from oh no he cornfield me so much a i don know what he do Even with good intention he doesn understand the full extent of his power and how they affect people He like Bill Soames But Bill dog doesn like him so he just cornfield it And given how everyone always enabling him this is unlikely to change Rod point out one particular thing of note in the intro he can feel every emotion The reason why he so nice to the grove animal in the story is because it make them feel good which make him feel good You could even say he an empath I suspect he doesn feel a lot of genuine joy from people and ha grown to expect this good fakey joy He might realize that something not quite right but they seem happy and everyone reassures him how good he being so he just roll with it That also why when he detects negative emotion he hone in on those and feel them strongly even more so since everyone trying to be happy all the time I really gotta hand it to Bill Mumy he doe a great job of creating this matter of fact god emperor vibe Given how most child actor are he go above and beyond to make Anthony feel smug and callous but in a way you kind of like He also ha that thosuand yard stare that add to the spook factor He really make the episode I glad he eventually got to go into space and build robot or whatever None of the other actor were terribly impressive mostly because they stuck on that hivemind of fear and fake smile The only other character with any semblance of personality are Aunt Amy and Dan Hollis Amy is a living example of how Anthony could mess up anyone even his own family It never clarified what he did to her but a vacant stare is brought up so you get the gist That might be why she seems le terrified of Anthony having the audacity to complain about the heat During Dan speech she reach ever so slightly for a poker implying she wa thinking of stabbing the little brat but chickened out Even though she not quite right she express her resentment toward Anthony a little more bluntly Also the snow at the end is a big screw you to her having commented on the weather earlier Dan the guy who stand up to tyranny and get gunned down immediately He seems petulant in a it my party i cry if i want to kind of way but the booze doesn help On one hand it like c mon bro you can wait till you get home you been living under this god for like six year what an hour or two but don forget they live in a subsistence economy In the story it wa clear that everyone traded thing around and I don think gramophone grow on tree It implied that they all die eventually unless Anthony materializes some food probably candy or something and they can enjoy that In the story Dan is transformed into something like nothing anyone would have believed possible The dan in the box wa all Twilight Zone It the perfect balance of horrific yet childish We don actually see it on screen it just the shadow with a brief cut to his face Just like how they didn show the triplicate gopher this is a smart touch not only because their special effect aren great but they leave more to the imagination When I see that cartoonishly deranged rabbit puppet pop out of the hat in the 1983 movie I can take anything seriously For what it worth it a funny scene filled with cheese just not what I expected This also happens in the 2002 revival when old Anthony burn a hole through someone and set them on fire That episode ha it own share of problem but we leave that for another day amp x200B Overall this wa a real good episode that deserves it spotlight Some worldbuilding and the of the nuance of Anthony character is lost from the original story but other thing are added like Dan telling Anthony off that heighten the conflict and make for a more entertaining watch Moonglow wa a good musical choice leaving behind a nostalgic bitterness behind it cheery service If I been familiar with this I would felt the absence of Doris Day lovely voice Not a super deep one but it compels you with the fear of being subjugated by a fickle omnipotent force to the point that you can even have your own thought And the feeling of closeted entropy that permeates this episode is just wonderful Everything will rot Hurrah amp x200B This is a random note but sometime around the end Mrs Fremont call Mr Fremont dad I can tell if this wa a mistake or if she just doe this because he Anthony dad and the world revolves around Anthony His parent are never given name which is odd Don Keefer wa great too I love how when he say the brandy is real good you can tell he actually being genuine for the first time in a long time So uh give this one a watch And read the original story too It online For free And tell me if you want more of these Leave some comment give your thought on the episode More to come Someday,The Groan Zone It a Good

12,JoewithaKbeforetheE,TwilightZone,Last night I watched The Midnight Sun and I remembered how much it scared me the first time I saw it It also scared me when they told me in elementary school that the sun would die one day and engulf our solar system Everyone ha different fear therefore there can be a number one but I want to hear which one struck on your fear and why you think it is the scariest Twilight Zone episode,What do you think the scariest Twilight Zone episode is
13,bigboiAnakin,TwilightZone,There is new trailer for each new episode of the cbs show So far they have one for The Comedian and nightmare at 30 000 foot,New Episode trailer
14,Nevev,TwilightZone,Judging by the trailer and information that come out so far what do you think will happen in the episode With 6 day left le than a week we close to seeing if expectation are met It almost the last chance to call anything Predictions for the series in general are also okay Here are some of mine Someone say the word delusion There a plane crash in 30 000 Feet and a cliffhanger ending,Specific prediction for the 2019 series
15,c_jlopez,TwilightZone,So i never really watched the series before I always heard people talk about it i watched Black Mirror and really liked it They said it wa a futuristic Twilight Zone and with Jordan Peele with the new one I thought this be the perfect time to watch the original episode What are some must watch or your favorite one,Never Watched It
16,larosha1,TwilightZone,I just finished an anthology of all the short story that were adapted by Serling Made me buy a collection of Richard Matheson story,The Short Stories
17,fuzzycorona,TwilightZone,Something I kinda love about the original Twilight Zone is just how early 60 it is That not to say that the episode aren relateable or creepy or poignant now but it really cool how clear it is that this show wa made at a time when the world wa still recovering from the Second World War there were lot of people who were still alive who come to America in the immigrant wave of the late 19th early 20th century everyone wa constantly terrified of nuclear war and people still thought the Wild West wa a cool and fun setting Nothing give me the same sense of history not even other old sci fi show Both the original Star Trek and Classic Doctor Who have socio political commentary don let anyone tell you otherwise but their protagonist are people who go to different place and have adventure not various ordinary people who wind up in various fucked up circumstance I really hope that Jordan Peele version of The Twilight Zone is able to stand the test of time and give people the same sense when they watch it 50 or 60 year from now This is why I don think people should worry about making science fiction timeless As the decade pas it turn into a cool snapshot of a time in history and or take on new and possibly different resonance,The Twilight Zone and History
18,JohnnyHildo4Congress,TwilightZone,This wa a TV movie from 1994 that featured two unproduced script One from Richard Matheson the other by Rod Serling amp x200B I really hated the Matheson portion A woman go to a movie theater and see portion of her past and future life play out This just sucked amp x200B The Rod Serling scripted episode wa a lot more nuanced It feature Patrick Bergin and Jack Palance It take place in 1868 Boston where a Civil War era surgeon go to meet a man who can animate dead human flesh It a lot more interesting than that amp x200B It hosted by James Earl Jones amp x200B I never hear anyone talk about this Thoughts,FYI Twilight Zone Rod Serling Lost Classics is available for free on Amazon Prime
19,TheMadBiscuit,TwilightZone,Does anyone know if the new twilight zone is going to be on TV or is it just on the CBS all access,The new series
20,electricmastro,TwilightZone,I felt that Mr Garrity and the Graves could have gone farther with the idea of a traveling salesman who unknowingly brings up zombie from their graf in the Old West I think it had more potential for there to be comedy terror and action from people fighting off against a horde of zombie,What episode didn use their idea to their full potential
21,MrKeemstar,TwilightZone,I do not have cable I am subscribed to netflix hulu shudder DC universe and I gonna subscribe to CBS just for the twilight zone I will still be paying alot le than what my family and many people I know pay for cable I eventually see cable TV dying not anytime in the near future but still I feel bad for people who cant afford another streaming service because of the fact that they already pay for cable and maybe 1 or 2 streaming service but that on them Am I missing something here Seriously tell me if I missing something I genuinely wanna know,An alternate perspective on the choice of platform for this show
22,JaxtellerMC,TwilightZone,Do we have any clue a to who is picking up the show overseas I assumed Netflix would take over like they did with the Star Trek show but there ha been zero announcement it a if we basically don exist,CBS The Twilight Zone for folk overseas
23,nulldrone,TwilightZone,I dropping the Serling shtick I can keep it up Basically the idea is that I saw some episode of The Twilight Zone a a child and I want to revisit it It an iconic piece of television and I like that it episodic so I can skip around I wa a dumb kid One for the Angels suck It not even scary so I find something new even in rewatches Also I looked up all the twist on Wikipedia because I wa a dumb kid Hopefully those stay buried I mostly be looking at the original 60 series but never say never It worth mentioning I don have Season 4 so we save our Jess Belles and Printer Devils for later Browsing through the catalog one of the episode that made a huge impression on me wa Perchance to Dream I remember it being terrifying and it had a cat in it which is always good But this cat out of the bag and diving foot first into the Twilight Zone amp x200B It still spooky Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statue and all that Even when people say they silly and cheesy I can help getting spooked But most of the spook come from Robert Florey directing I have to get back to some of his other episode According to Charles Beaumont Florey strove for quality and this episode might have been the most expensive MGM feature It show Right at the beginning we trail along a low angle shot of a building making it look powerful and imposing After that we cut between Edward Hall weary face and people cycling in and out of the building emphasizing how nerve wracking such a trivial task is for him It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity like an opener should With how quick these cut are I start to feel dizzy there a distinct sense of vertigo here In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written story are capable of conveying more information than television That obviously not true and this episode serf a a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition movement and sound Granted I haven read Beaumont original story but I can stress enough how great Florey directing is here This episode play with fear and paranoia and take it sweet time to build up to Hall serialized nightmare The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it shot really make me anxious Just like the beginning we flash between Hall panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object you gotta go back and wonder what Hall wa seeing in the building and people going through it Seeing the infamous eye for the first time isn even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drive my heart rate up and the aftermath feel like an afterthought Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can help it and it consequence are all too real whether a a car crash or death itself This idea continues a we enter Hall dream In a way a dream is just a form of Hall imagination only stronger and harder to escape When he talk to Maya for the first time she point out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it only a dream not realizing how much a dream can affect him It not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thought without realizing how they being consumed or how others can wave off one paranoid thought a something you can just think away Maya us this to her advantage it only a dream so why not indulge a little Not only into Hall fear but also into the thrill of a funhouse a rollercoaster or even a courtesan Maya represents Hall indulgence whether it into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear view mirror An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence The idea isn that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought The power of the mind is terrifying A low key fear of mine is Maya freakin laughter It there at the beginning of Hall dream it there a Hall get spooked by Maya and it there a Hall enters and exit the funhouse Juxtaposing laughter with dark unsettling imagery evokes not only that someone know something you don but also that they delight in your disorientation amp x200B Now it time to talk about my least favorite part of the episode the twist This episode didn happen Hall died 3 minute into the episode just after he entered Dr Rathmann office It a real Playtest There always something that bother me about these kind of twist it cheapens the episode a bit basically admitting to the audience that this wa all a fat load of nothing This episode fare better than most because thematically it deeply ingrained in dream a a stronger vehicle of the imagination Although Hall official cause of death is probably a heart attack we see that in his mind he commits suicide he can handle the idea that Maya ha followed him to this safe space and fear that she going to kill him so he end up doing it for her So what my beef with the twist So the idea is that Hall imagination end up consuming him Hall see someone who look like Maya and it scare him so much that he jump out the window But when this is revealed to be a dream something is lost It not like in Twenty Two where Liz experience the terror of seeing her dream play out in real life it would work if that were the case because Hall paranoid dream create dissonance with reality the painting isn really moving There nobody in the backseat Hall imagination is superseding reality With the twist Hall imagination is only superseding his imagination He imagined this scenario where the receptionist look like Maya and it too much for him Of course the ending reveals that the IRL receptionist Miss Thomas bear a striking resemblance to Maya but that practically irrelevant His dream is only referencing itself There no reality to ground it Who to say that both Maya appearance in the dream within a dream and the psychiatrist dream aren both based off of Miss Thomas If Shadow Play is anything to go off of Maya appearance might change with every dream Her piercing eye are her main feature And you could argue that the shock of seeing Maya is what drove his heart over the edge in real life but they barely feel connected The powerful fear of becoming disconnected with reality is lost completely because dreaming is a normal commonplace thing you not disconnecting from reality I actually like the set up Hall dream are affecting him IRL from the start not in some tenuous physiological connection but because they forcing him to stay awake Some have said that this is a more realistic episode but this is the part that swerve into fantasy the idea that the dream affected him so much it killed him You die in a dream you die in real life So why even have the twist Some say that Beaumont is overly indulgent in twist and I can kinda see that it a little cheesy in Person or Persons Unknown and A Nice Place to Visit but we have other example like Shadow Play and Long Live Walter Jameson that don really have twist though the twist to the latter is pretty weak The main two aspect of this twist are the idea of imagination consuming Hall life and the dissonance between reality and imagination What better way to show how powerful Hall imagination ha become by putting him fully into it through a dream and having that kill him Maybe I would liked it more if he just had vivid hallucination and ran around completely disorientated But the second part is the crux of the twist in his dream Hall dy violently and of his own accord he jump out of a window signifying his heart giving out But he dy peacefully in real life without nobody realizing the trauma he gone through On the one hand I like that the Twilight Zone is acknowledging that people see think and feel thing differently and want u to empathize more with others but this theme isn developed well enough I don hate the twist but I think it kind of lame and I wouldn go to it birthday party I don always like the subtle touch but the way it used here is decent just not in a way I can really get behind And I totally biased against this genre of twist so if you made it this far take this salt with a grain of twist Writing this out make me appreciate the twist more amp x200B Also John Larch who played Mr Fremont in It a Good Life come back front a Elliott Rathmann the psychiatrist Total coincidence I like him a lot better here a this wry understated psychiatrist that crack joke about not looking like Freud It interesting that he offer Hall a smoke a even then the health effect are known of course this is all Hall dream so we don actually know anything about the real Rathmann This wa probably an excuse to get him towards the window In fact what little we see of Rathmann show him a a more concerned active figure maybe Hall think of him a this droll character to help calm him down When Hall is explaining his strong imagination with every one of Rathmann reassurance Hall immediately responds with I know At no point doe Rathmann challenge Hall or give him any new information Hall is talking to himself And the smoke end up paralleling Maya giving him a light in his dream signifying the false sense of calm preluding the very real danger he in Clever Hall end up being half right in his paranoia falling asleep doe end up killing him but not in the way he expected He doesn end up dreaming in serial back to the carnival but rather someplace a safe and prosaic a a psychiatrist office It one thing to find something spooky in a spooky carnival but in an ordinary office Shock city Overall this is the kind of episode where you have to be right there with the protagonist to really enjoy it If you aren relating to Hall you could easily see this episode a slowly paced and kind of boring He loses me a little near the end but this is easily one of the better psychological thriller episode of the Twilight Zone And I know nobody will share my gripe with the twist so all the more reason to check it out This is a dream you won want to wake up from Also I forgot to talk about Richard Conte and Suzanne Lloyd performance They were good I liked their chemistry,The Groan Zone Perchance to Dream Review
24,OneEyed-Willy73,TwilightZone,Are the new episode original story or are they remake,The new Twilight Zone episode
25,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,Am I missing something Did we not learn anything from season four Episodes like Thirty Fathom Grave and The Parallel would be classic at twenty four minute the original and preferable length of a TZ episode,So every episode of Peele Twilight Zone is going to be an hour long
26,7deadlycinderella,TwilightZone,It definitely lacked the style of the 60 version and sorely missed Rod Serling but I thought it had a number of extremely classic episode too A Matter of Minutes Paladin of the Lost Hour A Small Talent for War I of Newton Nightcrawlers I think I of Newton is my favorite,Any other fan of the 80 version around here
27,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,I start this one off with one of my own The Fugitive What the hell kind of an episode wa that I know it not mentioned what happened to her parent but that neither here nor there The magician and the disabled girl living with her abusive aunt Obviously her parent are dead and the toy and stuffed animal are hers she moved from her home after her aunt got custody when they died and people come to arrest him even though it not illegal to show kid magic trick then it turn out that the magician wa really a king and the policeman were his entourage Just a weirdly written not well thought out episode at all At the end he turn himself into the girl identical twin sister just so he won have to separate from her and then the Magician and the girl leave an alien photo for the aunt to find but it actually a photo of a teenage heartthrob from the 1950 Where wa the logic in the whole thing from beginning to end,Not bad or scary but what are some of the most poorly written episode ever

42,curryeater259,TwilightZone,Will they be out at 12 am Or do they air on CBS or something and then come out Thanks,What time are the episode coming out
43,againreally-comoeon,TwilightZone,I writing this a the episode come out I haven watched them yet and I want to know if I should How wa it Was it good Great Ok Disappointing A complete disservice to the original A continuation of the original in level of quality How wa it Should I watch it,So how wa the remake
44,nulldrone,TwilightZone,What is this some sort of new wave expression or something saying dinosaur instead of lunch Hinge Thunder amp x200B I don care what Hinge think if it good enough for the Flintstones it good enough for anyone Howdy everybody Today on the most holy of day we do the unthinkable and leap forward to the 80 Farmer Jack I know I should be reviewing Erskine From 20 000 Martingale because that just make reed but clearly I not here to make reed This paste will no doubt be buried in cause about the endure stretch but that just how the world knot Now I know how the Krampusnacht folk feel during the holiday season New York I have never seen a single glacier of the 80 Farmer Jack but this one just sounded really coal if not didactic and magnificent Fasten your stepdads it gonna be a public dress knowledgable free Farmer Jack amp x200B No we not doing this for the whole paste I don care what the Fool Gods say There a difference between a funny joke and a big load of honey There a subtle bit at the beginning when the radio announcer say Friday Saturday and Sunflower This set the course for the rest of the episode Bill Lowery find that literally every single word including proper noun have swapped meaning And that the low key horror I beginning to expect from 80 Farmer Jack As funny a it is to hear people speak gibberish like it a normal thing it would be mind crushingly horrible to not only not understand anything no speech no writing nothing And everything that come out of your mouth make you sound like a babbling veil There are actual disorder like this people with receptive aphasia have damage in the Wernicke area the part of the brain responsible for processing language This can be caused by stroke injury brain tumor dementia it incredibly sad to see a loved one go through this I might liked it more if we got to see more of Kathy reaction but their son steal the spotlight Donnie illness seems mostly incidental but it doe add tension and the scene where Kathy and Hinge hug is really heartwarming You can tell he really needed that It also compelling how through his action Kathy can still see that he care deeply about their son despite being incoherent I like the dinner scene too You really wanna root for Hinge and see him get through this The ending end on a slightly depressing note acknowledging the reality that Hinge is gonna have to learn this language all over again except he ha to forget everything he already know I don know if this is easier or harder than learning a completely new language I go with harder since the word seem to be swapped at random without any reed of grammar For all we know throw is now fax and threw is now diphthong Still you wanna root for him And holy lederhosen do I hate the closing narration We know you didn come up with a reason We get it You don have to go into how slippery existence is or how Bill the tenacious everyman Honestly I wa disappointed in no opening narration but if this is the best you can do just scrap the narration completely I won miss them And for the record if you didn insist that this happened for no reason I would assumed it wa because he wa so focused on memorizing a bunch of medical jargon at the beginning It not a great impetus but it better than just going lol some thing just happen for no reason in the farmer jack character is what really matter This episode is a clever mix of comedy and drama Seeing people randomly swap out word and eventually devolving into gibbering beast is funny to u but with context it horrifying I argue 60 Farmer Jack doesn have it balanced a well though it might just come from the strong concept alone It also funny watching people try to spout nonsense with a straight face Cindy snicker a little while giving Hinge the timid waffle guarantee The neighbor stumble over encyclopedia a little bit I not 100 convinced these people think they saying something meaningful but the absurdity of what they saying make up for it I think the hospital scene wa one of the better spoken gibberish and you think that would cut the tension of the situation but not knowing how Donnie gonna do actually make it more tense I have a few small nitpicks like the overly dramatic wind that start blowing when Kathy say dinosaur Twice But for an episode that hinge on it concept it executes it serviceably and I probably put this a a decent plus episode when stacked up to the 60 series amp x200B Also I appreciate the minor insight that a lot of background sound get filtered out I didn catch the radio thing on my first watch nor did I end up paying too much attention to the gibberish background noise or the hospital speaker And I hope somebody out there with more love and patience than me try to decode some of these word I not sure how much thought the writer put into them but I do hear certain word pop up multiple time so I sure there a cipher rotting in a dumpster somewhere So the next time you see a foreigner trying to learn your native tongue maybe show them some kindness I hope the world last for you,The Groan Zone Wordplay Paste

52,WestWonWildly,TwilightZone,Watched the first ep read all the review I so disappointed and I wasn expecting much This isn a topic for people to chime in and defend the show but for u OG fan who are sad they just tacked the Twilight Zone name onto something subpar I really wish we got that DiCaprio Zone film instead of this cut paste Black Mirror,Come in here if you aren happy with the new Twilight Zone
53,ZachFoxStudios,TwilightZone,I just watched the first episode of the Twilight Zone reboot and while it definitely wasn terrible I felt there wa something missing I thought the cinematography wa fairly good the score wa also pretty good and the performance were all fairly solid But the story wa kinda lacklustre What I think wa missing wa an air of mystery throughout the whole episode we know exactly what is going on and more importantly why it going on The only thing that unknown to audience it how it will end but even that predictable A fix to this would be to remove the character that tell our main character what to do and have him discover that he ha the power himself which would lead audience to question what going on and why it going on Rather than him admitting he want fame we see his power fame slowly drive him crazy It would also probably chop down the runtime and leave u to slowly figure it out all the while create this sort of mysterious tone Rather than just flat out telling u what wa going to happen and why from the get go This is just my opinion but I definitely still interested in seeing where they take this series,So I just watch The Comedian I think I figured out why it didn click with me
54,jkw118,TwilightZone,Ok so year ago when I wa a kid I remember seeing one where the guy or his wife I think it wa his wife buy life insurance policy on him Some ridiculous amount In any case part of the life insurance is that they put this thing on him which he can take off and whenever something happens ie fall down heart attack etc It creates a foam cast on the guy and freeze him till they get him to the hospital What the heck show episode wa it any link etc,Looking for Lifeinsurance Twilight Zone
55,zabaci,TwilightZone,I really wanted for it to click with me but it missing something maybe it nostaliga or something else but I didn get hooked on the show just wanted to vent,sadly didn like the show

58,StarfleetTanner,TwilightZone,Noticed that they dropped 2 episode of the show already and they apparently released them in the morning rather than say at 8 PM or some other scheduled time Is this the plan for TZ Or will they switch to a broadcast scheduled format like the other All Access show IE Star Trek Discovery,So is Twilight Zone schedule different from other AA show

67,Traderguy84,TwilightZone,Only two episode in and it just feel like Twilight Zone Just the perfect mix of cheesy campiness dread atmosphere and plotting They really got this right Oh and let me just say right now that I am extremely picky about remake and just movie series in general I wa very pessimistic when I wa reading about the remake I wa in the They will NEVER come close to being a good a the original the remake will be terrible camp While I won say they are a good a the original so far I am VERY impressed with the first couple episode,As an AVID original Twilight Zone fan The new one are SO good

70,UsefulCamel,TwilightZone,Incredibly impressed My wife keep laughing because I normally can enjoy anything and I smiling ear to ear The intro song perfect no more Korn The intro video near perfect would have liked the window to smash not cry about it Peele narrator the omnipresent narrator living not in the real world or imagination but somewhere between perfect Episode 1 The Comedian I agree with all of you could have been a tad shorter Not 24 minute like some of you are suggesting It an intro to the series it should be longer Cut 7 minute out and you good The tone though absolutely perfect A rise a fall a selfless ish redemption Subtle hint to other horror movie in there the name The Torrances and the last shot I loved it Episode 2 Only complaint Why use the name The name is iconic with a specific storyline Call it anything else and it a perfect episode They build on the paranoia the sense that we know something is coming and no one belief u And then the twist at the end Just so perfect I got very high hope for this reboot a a kid that grew up watching the marathon every July and January growing up I went to film school because I would spend my free period modernizing TZ screenplay in high school I a miserable jerk Not much make me happy Episodes 1 and 2 they made me happy The tone is CORRECT They did an amazing job High hope,This made my insert any time frame you like
71,mat623,TwilightZone,nan,I think the comedian wa way too long too much filler The overall message of the episode wa confusing
72,mat623,TwilightZone,nan,So what wa the message of The Comedian
73,Ghidoran,TwilightZone,So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theory about it one is a mindbending Shyamalan esque twist the other is more metaphorical Theory 1 Sameer is a comedian past his prime with no friend or family due to his focus on his career and the whole episode is a delusion created by him to have a positive explanation for his current life Expanded Sameer wa actually a very successful comedian and the life he ha near the end of the episode no girlfriend or friend is his real life His heyday is behind him however and a his career start to slow down he realizes how empty his life ha become He wa too consumed with fame and ended up making no real friend or having a family Unable to cope with both a faltering career and no relationship to fall back on he begin to concoct this crazy delusional fantasy that he wa a struggling stand up comedian who had a loving girlfriend and friend but then he discovered the secret to making people laugh i e the plot of the episode Basically he pretend he got rid of old good life in order to become famous Ultimately he realizes his selfishness and give it all up by destroying himself thereby becoming an unknown This false reality help him cope with the sad situation of his current life At the end of the episode he doesn even exist to these people he just another memory of the comedy club immortalized in the photo This isn some supernatural trickery from Tracy Morgan it just the reality of a comedian who hit it big and then faded into obscurity Theory 2 The whole episode is an allegory for suicide and Sameer is actually a heavily distressed man who end up destroying his relationship with people around him and eventually kill himself Expanded Sameer is a very depressed He try to tell joke to make himself feel better hence why he see himself a a comedian tear of a clown and all that but in reality he continuously miserable represented by his inability to be successful He slowly destroys his closest relationship represented by the people he joke about disappearing in the episode which is something that happens in real life for some people with depression He doe this partly to make himself feel better represented by his newfound fame but ultimately he realizes he the cause of the pain At the end in a desperate bid to make everything right i e to get rid of the source of the pain he kill himself represented by him joking about himself and thus disappearing The end of the episode is a fantasy he envisioned with the people he loved going on with their daily life happy and him just being a forgotten memory represented by him being one of the photo on the wall These are just my theory anyway Obviously the surface level interpretation of the episode is don sacrifice friend and family for personal gain but I like to think there more to the episode Let me know your thought,Two theory about The Comedian
74,thatredbeanie,TwilightZone,The podcast host in Nightmare wa the host of the NoSleep podcast right I haven been able to find anything definitive Anyone back me up,So that wa David Cummings right
75,CannedInk,TwilightZone,They didn laugh when he repeated his old joke because his curse over the audience had no effect because it only worked if he kept going with new target showing that it wasn the joke but the curse that made them laugh in the first place They immediately began applauding at his low level humour when he chose new target that were personal to him the lack of humor over the Nazi he didn really know didn land a laugh showing that he couldn just choose any evil that wa foreign to him a a target I feel like that point is getting missed by the amount of criticism over his joke It go back to his point about the value in his humour and not wanting to stoop to the level of other comedian for the fame and eventually he address it his final act Ranty but feel like we should address the fact that his joke being bad but getting a laugh wa the point He wa cursed to only get a laugh when he gave up thing personal to him not given the gift of better comedic writing,The Comedians joke were meant to be dumb
76,GilliamFan17,TwilightZone,I about 20 minute in and I realized why it so visually unappealing it wa shot for black and white The soft focus hard shadow and awkward closeup would all play much better in black and white but don fit the medium of color I think that this is evidence that the reboot wa not meant to be in color but one of the CBS higher ups must have changed their mind,Why The Comedian Looks So Ugly
77,P-terson,TwilightZone,Whenever the main character go to check his contact for Devan his contact include many name of character from classic episode Henry Corwin from Night of the Meek Peter Corrigan from Back There Al Denton from Mr Denton on Doomsday Al Cadwallader from Escape Clause James Corry from The Lonely James Embry from King Nine Will Not Return and possibly more that I missed Very clever allusion to the classic character of the series,Did anyone else notice this in The Comedian

79,aTVisAthingTOwatch,TwilightZone,Turn the color all the way down on your TV Monitor problem solved,For Everyone Complaining About the Reboot Not Being in Black and White
80,Mohamad979,TwilightZone,Its seems my previous post about the new twilight zone show were controversial to say the least So I just wanted to give a honest critique about the first episode and intrested to what you guy have to say I think the main reason i didn really like this first episode wa not the vulgarity or the 1 hr running like alot of people pointed out The main reason why I didn enjoy it wa the main character wa in control of the twilight zone causing the twist to be seen from a mile away The first episode reminded me me of a mature goosebump episode with a mix of a game of pool I wonder what you guy think,My honest critique about The Comedian
81,kristin137,TwilightZone,People are crazy There have only been 2 episode so far and even if they not perfect lot of show have a rough start On Amazon there are dozen of 1 star review about what a horrible leftist agenda the first episode ha no one want to see anything from Jordan Peele who is now a racist and also profanity is the worst thing that ha ever happened,Have you guy seen the Amazon review
82,TallTitan34,TwilightZone,Wouldn everything go back to the way it wa because Tracy Morgan would have never existed,What If The Comedian Told A Joke About Tracy Morgan
83,BigOlDisneylandNerd,TwilightZone,I feel like the only one who walked away with my jaw on the floor after The Comedian Like yes you would probably get the episode right away after a while but it wa just SO well done showing Sameer descent into madness and that little nod at the end to The Shining Wow I had my mouth covered the last 10 15 minute or so despite guessing how it would have ended That how I like my Twilight Zone About to start the second episode soon I have very high hope for this,Completely Mindblown
84,aTVisAthingTOwatch,TwilightZone,In the very first episode Where is Everybody the scene where Mike Ferris becomes trapped in the telephone booth wa actually based on an incident that happened to Rod Serling in real life Serling recounted that he wa at an airport making a phone call when he heard the boarding call for his flight over the intercom Hastily trying to get out of the booth he started pushing on the door forgetting in his panic that phone booth are opened by pulling on the door handle Serling waved down a passerby for help and the man kicked in the door Though Serling found his mental lapse humiliating he incorporated it into this episode,Today I Learned
85,RecyclopsPolluticorn,TwilightZone,I tried to laugh along with the audience but couldn I stopped watching 10 minute in so maybe it got better Why couldn he have just told the Thanksgiving Parade story instead That shit kill,The Twilight Zone I just wish Kumail Nanjiani joke were better
86,OldTrailmix,TwilightZone,Nightmare at 30 000 foot wa by far my preferred episode of the two released today and that is for it ability to rework a classic story into something new and thought provoking The tenseness of air travel in our modern world i e post 9 11 is perfectly represented In the 1963 episode you have a guy that absolutely losing his shit next to his wife and no one really give a fuck besides trying to calm him down In the 2019 version nobody on the plane is putting up with any fuckery Adam Scott character is supposed to be a master of civility yet his best attempt although misconstrued to save the flight are met with open hostility culminating in a zip tie Adam Scott character ha become a widely published magazine author by championing civility but at the end he is murdered by an unruly mob I think this is the meta commentary of this episode At least in the United States a lot of center left Democrats embrace civility a a mean to move the country forward Yet Republicans maintain their power despite not having the favor of the majority They take the low road and win I know this sound like soapboxing but this point is reinforced a Adam Scott magazine article is quite literally about civility in politics there is a Statue of Liberty on the cover On top of that Scott is taking a flight to Tel Aviv a hotspot of political unrest and violence Wherein Palestinians are being subjugated by Israel a client state of the US Not a lot of civility there As if that weren enough Scott character reference doing work in Yemen where Saudi Arabia us US funded arm to fight a proxy war with Iran Not a lot of civility there either Then we reach the end of the episode Scott character is killed by the unruly mob Where the civility there It absent Scott civility ultimately only killed himself Scott is the lone dumbass who gave the cabin code to an alcoholic ex pilot He wa a dope The lesson is not to listen to someone just because they reassure you that you right that they have power and can save you You have to stand by your belief and think critically Scott meeting someone in the middle of the road no matter how flawed they are mentality doomed him,Nightmare at 30 000 foot wa fucking great and here why
87,humming_bear,TwilightZone,Overall I loved the episode Misty if the complaint I seeing I don agree with but to each their own Meanwhile my complaint hadn been posted I did not like the swearing I know it an adult show I know that cursing and crass language is common to the point of being the norm That being said twilight zone to me wa always the epitome of class It didn descend to being common It sought to promote thought and discourse Can that still happen when character are saying fuck and pussy Probably but it alters the tone of the show for me I suppose I being a prude or too nostalgic maybe Just a half baked thought,Odd complaint about The Comedian
88,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,It ha to be one of them anyway,Is suck my vagina the stupidest line uttered in a Twilight Zone episode
89,steven10090,TwilightZone,I love the twilight zone but also enjoy the outer limit but don understand why one became more popular than the other,Why did twilight zone become more popular than the outer limit
90,totteridgewhetstone,TwilightZone,I know some show have podcasts where people review the show I had a look and there about a million Twilight Zone podcasts so wondering if anyone had any recommendation of people talking about the new show,Is there a review Podcast
91,deficiency_xsgx,TwilightZone,nan,Im so glad they chose to use the original music for the new show I always get chill when i hear those three note
92,_alphabot_,TwilightZone,after watching the first episode of the reboot i found myself wanting to watch the original in it entirety since it so easy to access through streaming but i am a bit overwhelmed at the number of episode i know there fan favorite and immediate classic but are there any episode i can skip over just to cut down on the amount of material the original offer or is every single one worth watching also are any of the other reboot attempt worth looking into and if so are those streaming anywhere thanks y all,watched the first episode of the reboot and have question about the original
93,TrickyGypsea,TwilightZone,I dont have cable I live in Canada Does anyone know where i can find the first episode Cheers,Ive been searching for hour
94,babubaichung,TwilightZone,nan,Disappointed with the first episode I don want to obviously think that the entire reboot is bad but I am definitely disappointed by the first episode It wa long slow the acting fell flat I really hope it get better Cheers
95,stolenmerch,TwilightZone,In response to some of the bad review of The Comedian of being too political which I didn find to be that true I seen others claim this wa the entire point of the original series which I don find to be that true either Yes there were definitely political episode e g I Am the Night Color Me Black but I thought most episode were standard sci fi paranormal twist with many being more universal social commentary about morality and internal individual struggle For me political mean an episode ha some allegory about contemporary current affair Do you all feel the original series is overtly political in nature,Was the original series actually that political
96,bigboiAnakin,TwilightZone,I see a ton of people hating on it but I thought The Comedian wa a little predictable but fun and I really enjoyed 30 000 foot Also I thought Jordan Peele killed a host and I like that the episode are longer Can wait for next week,I I the only one who actually like the new episode
97,trover2345325,TwilightZone,Hey what if I say that the audience score of Twilight zone 2019 series is 53 which is not good http www rottentomatoes com tv the _twilight _zone _2019 s01 audience _reviews http www rottentomatoes com tv the_twilight_zone_2019 s01 audience_reviews because with this rating I have a feeling that this series will run for 2 or 3 season amp x200B But on the bright the user score of metacritic is 8 9 which is good,Twilight zone 2019 rotten tomato audience score is 53
98,Darthmemer1234,TwilightZone,A big problem with the other reboots imo wa that they didn do the narrator gimmick justice Of course Rod Serling can never be replaced but Jordan is so good His deep foreboding voice is absolutely perfect for the show I loving it so far,Does Anyone Else Love Peele Voice
99,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,I know there are a bunch of way to interpret this episode but a comment and a question by u SentimentalSentinels inspired me to type and share my take on it One of my favorite part of watching the Twilight Zone is dissecting the meaning and seeing what we can take from it Much like the original this episode wa a study in paranoia personal mentality and distress In my view Bob the pilot exemplified how authority figure often exploit those fear to serve their own purpose Unlike the original the monster in this episode wa fear paranoia and the danger of how that manifest i e seeing connection that don exist distrust of others prejudicial thinking conspiratorial thinking blaming others etc Furthermore I think the argument could be made that the monster is Sanderson himself but unlike the first iteration of the show the writer hint that the monster within u is more dangerous than the unknown monster outside on the wing u SentimentalSentinels also made a great point about how they use the podcast to exemplify how sensationalism in the medium play a role in feeding these emotion I e the podcast Sanderson article etc To go one level deeper in my view Bob the pilot personified how a person of semi authority can parrot our concern to play into our greatest fear Once we feel that that person truly understands u or that they are the only one who can help they use their power to exploit our clouded judgement to cause chaos great harm The saddest part wa that Sanderson wa so blinded by desperation and fear that he didn realize he wa helping to cause the chaos he wa desperately trying to prevent The pilot played on Sanderson paranoia and fear to seize control and takeover the plane and achieve the end he sought Depots and demagogue use this tactic the time They demonize an other a a source of a problem play into the fear of a large population of people and use it to seize power and control for their own power control Much like the episode the depot oftentimes do this at the expense of the people they claimed they were helping I think this episode can be interpreted a a microcosm of that behavior Know this may be a reach and your mileage may vary but I really enjoyed it and just wanted to include my two cent Please post your theory or commentary would love to hear all the differing opinion and hopefully have my mind opened to thing I hadn considered,The deeper meaning amp subtext in Nightmare at 30 000 foot
100,bogdaddy12,TwilightZone,Watched the first episode I had faith not going to lie that they wouldn inject politics into this but ala And I saw all the preview for the other two episode Really I guarantee you that we aren going to get a white straight male who is remotely good or not written to be a strawman Thank Hollywood,Another show ruined by liberal politics
101,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Hey you totally killed tonight Guy Oh thank you you know I actually un killed two people Samir amp x200B And just like that we hopping on the hype train Ironically this episode isn all that funny and the quote above wa one of the few joke I laughed at It a shame they got Tracy Morgan just to have him on for 5 minute a this spooky brooding devil type Yeah this episode more intent on being dramatic with the classic deal for fame shtick And generally I think it doe a good job Kumail Nanjiana isn the funniest dude but I like his kinda pathetic drama thing goin on And what little we see from other comedian isn that great either but whatever When we see Samir get angry on stage and do an impromptu erasing we feel his frustration This is some genuine shit talking I liked his monologue at the end when he admits that he doesn know why he want fame it go back to this empty vulnerability that sends him off with a shred of sympathy Ladies and gentleman give it up for the Twilight Zone amp x200B Even though the premise of this episode is pretty basic I still intrigued by the idea it going with Because often a a comedian you do share your life with others and thing become le personal especially when you a somebody Like if you really famous and you bitter over an ex you can call them out and it awkward for both of you I guess this isn really a problem in the episode but I like that it grounded And I agree with our pretentious friend David comedy is art When you write a book you can cover thing up use a metaphor or just have different character act out event based on your life experience Peele seems to agree after all he call Samir an artist I feel to some extent this is a minor commentary on Peele own career The line between comedy and horror is thinner than you think And yes this is an hour long episode I haven seen Season 4 of the 60 Zone so I guess I take your word for it that it wa mixed I don think this is necessarily a bad fit for the episode but I am annoyed that it take Samir an extra 10 minute to figure out what going on There a part to all these Twilight Zone episode when something supernatural happens and the main character try to rationalize it or think people are pranking him We call this gag time Then about halfway into the episode thing really kick off with Samir erasing all the jerk from high school we get plenty of reference to character from 60 TZ and the pacing get dialed up to 11 going for some real pacing whiplash I think this whole episode take place in about a month A week I also think that they killed off DiDi too quick and Rena should interrupted him on that day maybe he already listing a bunch of people to try to impress Candy Sure he hesitates a little but it just not enough for the day that can make or break his career Sure seeing him get angry and numb to his murder spree is alright but I think that would been more effective I don think 22 minute is enough for the episode but it could been trimmed down a bit Nothing feel horribly padded I have to admit the part where Rena break up with Samir is weak They trying to be clever by having Rena call him out about how selfish he is for yuckin around while she ha to make end meet a a waitress when in reality we know the real reason he selfish is because he erasing hundred of people for fame It just hard for me to buy the fake reason They try to wave this by saying their relationship isn a good without David existence but what setting this off If she going to stay together with him for 5 year then being late for one day isn going to be the straw that break the camel back Not to mention that his career finally is taking off which mean it only a matter of time until he can start supporting them anyways I wa hoping that this whole erasing people ha consequence thing would be showcased differently like maybe by erasing hundred of bad people the police are more lax or something And Samir is right when he said she wa okay with him erasing people for fame which is honestly a weird thing for her to encourage Maybe she doesn believe he actually erasing people but she seemed pretty on board This also lessens the emotional impact when she criticizes his act later You already knew this It not clear what happens to people after he tell the joke since his joke are just him ribbing on people who don exist anymore Despite his fame nobody ever going to quote or tell one of his joke That another thing with the whole you have to give something up during stand up idea because you don actually give it up Sure it not longer personal and it can mess with your relationship but good joke last a people retell them So everyone just think he funny and nobody know why Weird One of the most surprising complaint I come across is the swearing TV MA is the first thing that pop onto the screen You know what you were getting into I welcome that Peele Twilight Zone ha the privilege of saying more and doing more It wa pretty subdued in Nightmare From 30 000 Feet I actually thought the Oh shit He the pilot wa really funny And when Sanderson say he saw fucked up shit near the beginning that wa a pivotal character defining moment Pretty good swears They used differently in The Comedian Now to those of you complaining about the swears have you never been to a comedy club before I do hope you never check one out because you probably have a heart attack The biggest perpetrator of casual swears who I like to call The Swear Bugbear is DiDi Scott I love DiDi She my favorite Her swears aren forced they integral to her act and her character and make her a great foil for Samir When Samir tell her to take all her advice in an e mail and send it to the bottom of the ocean she retaliates with Yeah hey could you suck my vagina It great Not only doe it contrast these character but it show how they like to banter and it some good early light heartedness When Rena break up with Samir you really believe that DiDi is his only friend left and that give the scene where he era her some weight to it Also when Samir tell DiDi not to say any of the bad word in front of his girlfriend nephew I swear that a jab at you guy And the other guy who joked about censoring c ss Some good premonition here Obviously swearing isn always good and it can get overly vulgar and excessive but I don think we there yet Not even close amp x200B So doe it measure up to the 60 Twilight Zone There a knee jerk no because it hard to make a continuation of something while capturing the heft of being original and groundbreaking And a somebody who watching many 60 Twilight Zones for the first time I might be complaining that some of the older episode are pretty cliche with obvious twist I know that not fair because a lot of them weren cliche at the time but that doesn change my viewing experience But that doesn necessarily make an episode bad either If I can enjoy the ride the destination isn a important And I enjoyed this ride I also don really care about whatever arbitrary standard come with the title The Twilight Zone Good stuff is good y know I liked some of the exaggerated lighting choice that made Eddies look dark and grimy I like Samir and Rena relationship and it wa cute to see them be happy for a short bit even if you know they just included that to fuel the break up later Freaky deaky murderer need love too And I know people were pent up about this series being overly political but this episode wasn political at all sans some bad political joke from our boy Samir Actually it weird that he always open with the 2nd amendment joke is that like the only joke he been telling For 5 year No wonder he so desperate He also made a joke about our president and speaking of which given that he so interested in politics I surprised he not using them for some kind of political gain I doubt he be careful enough to think about the repercussion Now that be an interesting episode in it own right almost like a more upfront The Whole Truth So those are my hot take on the new modern 20 Jordan Peel 3rd Reboot Twilight Zone extravaganza I liked it You can make me un like it Will I review all the new thing Sure but maybe not right away I don really feel like reviewing the Adam Scott airplane podcast gremlin doll spectacular right now so we still keeping our foot firmly rooted in the 60 Even though those have only consisted of 50 of these review so far Hmm This is also where I plug my Wordplay review because I wa hoping more people would read that like one But yeah I feel pretty optimistic about this series and I think it gonna be a blast Also I can tell if the airplane joke wa a reference to the next episode or not but I feel like it totally is And they had the dummy from The Dummy And there were also name reference in Samir contact Aren reference fun,The Groan Zone The Comedian Review
102,FoamCupPhone,TwilightZone,nan,I think in a genius way The Comedian showed that joke on the current political climate his 2nd Amendment and fascist joke are low hanging fruit aren funny and they don cost a Comedian anything
103,XanPerkyCheck,TwilightZone,I have seen both episode that are out now and they appear to have major comedic element Even casting comedy actor like Kumail Nanjiani Adam Scott and Chris Diamantopoulos played Russ Hanneman on Silicon Valley It make a lot of sense that the host is Jordan Peele too lmao,Was the original series also a comedy

111,Scarlet-Witch,TwilightZone,There wa a very intentional focus on Peele bracelet a he pick up the recorder at the end of the episode It is the Airborne Proficiency Badge awarded to paratrooper in the US Army This is significant because the original narrator Rod Serling served a a paratrooper in the 11th Airborne Division during WWII,Jordan Peele bracelet easter egg in Nightmare at 30 000 Feet
112,BobHenry05,TwilightZone,Can tell if it lack of organization from the mod or people actually don give a shit about the new show but it kinda strange how there no official discussion thread or stickies Someone suggested maybe we need a new subreddit for the reboot I don know maybe I a minority for enjoying the reboot but I think there should be some kind of sticky or episode discussion on here or a place for fan to enjoy the new show together Love it or hate it this is the new Twilight Zone it ha flaw but I feel there is still a fan base Thoughts,Where is everybody Discussion on Peele Reboot
113,AdmiralDolphin11,TwilightZone,I didn care much for the Comedian and liked 30 000 foot until the last few minute however I continue to believe a reduced 30 minute format help fix many plot issue Even the OG series tends not to easily stream the 45 60 min Season 4 episode an issue they course corrected with in Season 5 I wondered what the TZ community think,30 minute episode are the perfect Twilight Zone format
114,Mohamad979,TwilightZone,I am a big fan of the original show Since were always talking about the best episode I thought it would be fun if we talk about the worst Excludes season 4 a that would be too easy of a target Here are mine that just didn do it for me I sing the body electric The mighty casey Cavander is coming The whole truth How about you guy Intrested to hear what you have to say,We all talk about the best episode from the original series a how about the mediocre or bad episode
115,ajs723,TwilightZone,At face value the theme of this episode seems to be something to the effect of If we don learn and move on from the horror of our past our attempt to be civil will end catastrophically On an individual level that a weird almost nonsensical lesson However taken from the standpoint of US foreign policy it sort of spot on Justin is literally flying from the US to the Middle East a someone who think he know everything that going to happen while also seeing himself a a beacon of civility In the end his idea of civility and his attempt to rescue people who by the way didn need his intervention lead to disaster and make them all violently attack him If we think of Justin a the US and the passenger a the Middle East this is pretty poignant,Is there a deeper political message to Terror at 30 000 Feet
116,justlike12,TwilightZone,Can I go on an English teacher rant for a second I appreciate the intent of changing the pit of man fear in the new intro I all for representation in the Zone But the man fear line never made me feel excluded a a woman because I understood that it is hu man fear Rod is taking about The universality of our common fear and reaction to the show illustration of them is a uniting force I feel like the showrunners missed the point here because by saying one fear it break that communion with sublime transcendent primal terror and make it seem more personal and about individual fear I wished they thought to go with the pit of our fear instead,The pit of one fear
117,cerikn,TwilightZone,nan,Wow this reboot is absolutely terrible How did they manage to screw this up
118,DanceswithTacos_,TwilightZone,SpongeBob doe standup no one think he funny and then when he start making fun of Sandy squirrel he becomes an overnight sensation He loses his friendship with Sandy and in the end learns to make fun of himself The similarity are pretty remarkable http www dailymotion com video x58i8n7,The new episode is literally just the SpongeBob episode Squirrel Jokes
119,VankTar,TwilightZone,The episode ha a hyper focus on technology beginning with the opening shot which show the main character standing in a high tech body scan security machine From there the majority of the technology in the airport is shown to be modern if not a little futuristic The airport ha a spartan distinctly futuristic look and there a deliberate close up on the main character AirPod earbuds However once we enter the plane the majority of the technology we see is archaic by modern standard For an international flight the seat themselves are extremely old fashioned and the main cabin screen which livestream from the cockpit are a design that ha mostly been phased out in favor of seat screen in modern aircraft This technological dissonance build with the introduction of the mp3 player and it pointed necessity of old fashioned headphone But none of this ever go anywhere It doesn appear to factor into the plot or theme of the episode indeed no one even ever really acknowledges the strangeness of the MP3 player and the production design choice are ultimately totally incidental to the twist By the way the twist is It turn out a random insane man wa empowered by a traumatized reporter action while interacting with a magical MP3 player to crash a plane for no reason in such a way that completely destroyed the plane but literally everyone survived and wa dry and they all united to murder the traumatized man and I guess never looked at the MP3 player because it wa taken by a narrating omnipresent being,Nightmare At 30 000 Feet bizarre and pointed use of anachronistic technology in it production design is really distracting and ultimately meaningless to the plot twist
120,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Well is it If it is can there please be at least one special shot only in black and white,Jordan Peele Twilight Zone Is Available Now
121,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,nan,I guess they keep Jordan Peele for a little while but who going to take over hosting for him if something come up
122,Doombuggyman,TwilightZone,Has anyone figured out what make and model they used,The MP3 Player from Nightmare at 30 000 Feet
123,GermanPanda,TwilightZone,these critic and some of the member of this sub have been The comic wa beautifully shot first of all had some clever twist amazing if you compare it to other CBS show edge and at the end of the day debatable take from the show I wa a paid stand up comic for a few year and grinding it out at the open mics night after night and hearing the same political brow beating over and over again did get old and it did come across a hack almost every time Was that the message or wa the message that audience are stupid and mostly they don want to learn they just want to see you suffer and in return they will laugh and praise you I dunno I just woke up and it wa the first thing on my mind and I can wait to watch more Peele hit me right in the heart with this first episode and I beyond excited for the rest of the season,Watched the first episode and what a pretentious mess
124,HJuanZeeJuan,TwilightZone,Just found out about the remake and wa massively excited Suffice to say 15 minute in i got bored and switched it off This definitely isnt the twilight zone No narrator huge 1 hour episode that take away from the core idea of the original Super interested to see what others think,Something about this doesn rub me the right way
125,ForgetfulLucy28,TwilightZone,Because after these episode and Us I starting to think Get Out wa a fluke Or just exceptional because he had more time to write it,How much input doe Jordan Peele actually have
126,trover2345325,TwilightZone,This is just an opinion but have you wondered why the twilight zone 2019 reboot ha to be TV MA Maybe the reason is because it should not only match up with the current anthology series that aim for a mature audience but also cover political issue and current social issue in our world that are controversial especially the darker part of humankind similar to the original twilight zone,Why the 2019 twilight zone ha to be TV MA
127,luigirools,TwilightZone,TL DR I didn care for it at all Just about everything decision in the production felt off to me and I very disappointed Let me start by saying I wa really hoping to enjoy this a lot I a huge fan of the original series and caught a few here and there very late in the evening when I slept over my Grandma house Last year I decided to finally take the plunge and watch each episode and while not everyone wa a winner I estimate 5 10 perhaps aren very good but by and large the series is an absolute classic and a must watch for fan who are interested in science fiction Especially if you like looking at the story from their place in history and the influence they had in pop culture I remember growing up hearing about The Twilight Zone in song lyric and cartoon metaphor in day to day language the show wa and still is pretty inescapable in some capacity With all that being said it an understatement to say that I wa excited for a Brand New stylish series for my generation that paid homage and nodded liberally to the original series Now I really think that I may have been too excited a I often am for new thing This often lead me to big disappointment but I keep holding on and hoping for something great Jordan Peele reboot of the series start off with a very rocky episode that really make me hesitant to even continue Just about everything that I don like about newer medium is present here Bland and boring visuals underwhelming writing unlikable character and a overly drawn out runtime 1 Bland and Boring Visuals Overall I just think that the visual style is rather boring The color palatte is drab and muted just like most everything else today The camera work is creative in a few place but for the most part wa shot like it wa any other show I wa expecting or rather hoping the show to have more flair or at least to have it own unique visual style It not amateur or anything but it didn stand out or excite me in any way I really wish a show like this would take the opportunity to really go crazy with vibrant color and nonstandard camera angle They could use element like those to visually tell the story without the need for verbose dialogue 2 Underwhelming Writing Unlikable Characters The writing in this episode wa all over the place The dialogue never felt natural like all the character are reciting from a script a bad script It really felt forced most of the time I kept thinking to myself this is not how people talk Usually this would not bug me a much but they are obviously going for a real world tone and that clash with the dialogue that try too hard to sound hip with new expression instead of just sounding like normal people It really creates this odd disconnect with the world it creates and it just ended up feeling really forced That brings me to my next problem the cursing Now I not a prude at all I love raunchy stuff when it fit but the constant swearing doe not fit at all If I wanted to hear people swear THAT much I would have watched a Rob Zombie film That not a knock at Zombie at all I love his work and all of his movie are very entertaining in those story the raunchy dialogue work a lot better than it doe here But I will say that the character in Rob Zombie film are every bit a unlikable a the character in this episode I not sure if that wa the intention to have no relatable character but none of the character had any redeeming quality Every last one wa mean spirited and it lessened the impact of the story and it also deadened the asserted moral I not even sure at this point that there wa a moral to this story but it sort of seems like there wa one It just confusing and the narrative wa all over the place It just really reminds you of how the original series didn need to swear to get the story across The story we played straight and handled with a lot of class and all of that wa missing here I really think that is the single biggest factor that detracts from the episode there wasn any class at all Just clunky and overly raunchy dialogue not to mention the very unlikable character It all just feel so mean spirited and unnecassary 3 Overly Drawn Out Runtime This one is the problem I have the least to say about but it only exacerbates the previous problem I mentioned The runtime is just too darn long Most of the runtime is rather boring to look at and not fun to listen to The story isn a complex one at all and could have been told in a much shorter time I don know why film and television are trending toward stretching out the runtime but I really don like it Most of the time the film or show isn made any better with the inclusion of double the runtime and oftentimes it just get very tedious and boring to slog through something for that long Every Marvel movie that coming out is at least 2 or 2 and a half hour long and the newest upcoming film in the series Avengers Endgame is a staggering 3 hour long Why I get really bored sitting through anything for that length of time Typically it isn filled with anymore meat just more fluff for whatever reason and that is definitely the case for this episode a well I really wish these sort of show and movie would cut off the fat and just get to the point Final Thoughts Yeah this episode wasn my cup of tea and I am very disappointed about that I wa really hoping for a respectful insightful and visually engaging Twilight Zone reboot but what I ended up seeing wa completely a different product I will admit I am very disinterested to even continue on with the series At this point I much rather just continue to watch the remaining few episode of the original series and the first two revival that I haven seen yet Yet I not wanting to completely throw out the towel yet Many people say the first episode is a heck of a stinker but go on to praise the second much more highly I still not completely sold from the preview I seen it just doesn look any better The ONLY thing I think they nailed wa the music It PERFECT The opening and closing rendition of the original and the cue inspired by the original are really fun and I like to listen to the music on it own on Spotify or something Jordan Peele himself is passable a a host he isn captivating or anything but he is a highlight for the episode that for sure Overall this episode wa about a deep a a puddle and about a interesting to look at a one too but I will admit that that would be an insult to puddle There are some good bit but it mostly surrounded by bitter and unsavory chunk that left a bad taste in my mouth Please feel free to leave a comment and discus some counter point or addition you like to add to my review I always willing to hear differing opinion and I hoping for some open communication about how everyone felt about the episode,Episode 1 The Comedian My Review

145,UsefulCamel,TwilightZone,Yes we all want to watch all of them right now because impatience But do we see the sense of community and discussion we building in this sub by going all at the same pace Rather than one person accidentally spoiling episode 6 and one person hating 4 while you still on episode 3 we all watching a they go along and really breaking down each episode piece by piece Some like them some hate them but at least we discussing them It good to be patient The payoff is normally better,To the people complaining about them not releasing all the episode at once

148,Claymationdude07,TwilightZone,I wa wondering why every single person on the plane survived the crash and sure it work for the poetic ending when they all massacre the main guy But then I thought about car crash Experts always say it better to get in a car crash where you don know it coming so your body is limp you aren trying to brace yourself for the impact Everyone on the plane wa put to sleep so their body would be lifeless in the crash I also tend to believe that once our protagonist realizes the plain is going down remove his oxygen mask and get knocked out a well so he wouldn have to live through the crash that why he just wake up on the beach I would Of course this doesn explain why nobody even ha a scratch on them or why they didn drown just an interesting thought,Spoiler I have an explanation for part of the ending of 30 000 foot
149,Goose21995,TwilightZone,Its absolutely redicules how many AMAZING tv show we are loosing because of corporate greed Regardless if you like it or not the new T Z just started so it got to catch it footing and be a little broader to attract a good audience then you can judge it when it in it prime and they have a little more creative freedom Give it a chance But there wont be a chance becase this shit gonna flop Not because it bad but because these streaming service have this bright idea to hold show hostage on their shitty streaming platform which nobody is going to pay for just for one show then it inevitably get cancelled Starz did that with ash v evil dead and most ppl didnt even know it existed But now that it on Netflix it actually gaining traction and a cult following too bad it already gone Disney is trying to pull this shit with the netflix marvel show Thats why they canned the punisher and jessica jones because thwy want future marvel show in their disney streaming garbage Only hope would be if all the episode came put at once so people could do a free trial watch it and convince themselves it worth it But NOBODY is going to pay 20 a month for a show that might take up to 4 month of payment just to watch one goddamn season No thank you And thanks for utterly destroying what ive been hoping for since i wa a kid Thanks a bunch Fucking corporate coward Always scared to take a risk,CBS is dooming the future of this show

155,justanothernakedred,TwilightZone,Whilst I haven done a very deep dive yet I have yet to see many interesting interpretation of what the first couple of episode are about I seen a couple of people complain that they feel shirked by the feeling of a left wing agenda but I personally didn feel this and wonder if this is down to Samir Second Ammendment joke To me the first episode felt like an indictment of cancel culture Samir naming and shaming of his subject cause their very existence to be entirely wiped out along with any impact they have had on the world Whilst his first chosen subject have done grave terrible act such a drink driving and paedophilia the crime quickly slip into a grey area with his subject guilt being more questionable each time To me Samir feel like the left wing medium and by the end we come to realise that he is looking for anyone to talk about just to feed his hungry audience and he is definitely not the good guy The second episode message is le overt to me but something about an investigation ultimately over nothing and involving a Russian red herring definitely feel on the nose with regard to the Mueller investigation and the left general paranoia over Trump Perhaps more on the nose is the protagonist article being called the end of civility At least in my own interpretation the overall usability message so far is similar to that of Peele recent movie The Twilight Zone feel like it is asking the left to scrutinize itself I love it,The socio political commentary of the first couple of episode

164,oceaneyed5,TwilightZone,nan,Do I need to watch the older twilight zone to understand the new one or is this just a reboot
165,VankTar,TwilightZone,The political message of this episode isn concise enough to make sense to me Free of the comedy context it seems to be really mostly about public shaming and how toxic and damaging it is to everyone involved even if someone deserves it This crescendo when Samir literally us the word Me Too to erase someone who doesn deserve to be erased and derails his wife life by eradicating one of her biggest supporter and mentor But the show doesn really acknowledge that It sort of is just like poor Samir he a piece of shit now he gone He gave up too much of himself I seen a lot of analytical and intellectual read of these new Twilight Zone episode but all of them require big reach to make them work in the thin context of what actually presented There no there there,The Comedian message about public shaming is incoherent and doesn come together in a meaningful way

medium outside of it historical context is often tricky Is it fair to judge a piece of art for being cliche if it pioneered that cliche How much bearing should that have on my opinion I can sit here and pretend like it all well and good and not something I seen a million time before but that disingenuous Now when I put on my reviewer hat I ought to be understanding of context but that easier said than done Genies Jinn have been around for millennium They intelligent have crazy power and look real weird They can be your angle or yuor devil They basically a unique and varied a human but like superhumans And a we all know human need to be kept on a leash hence the whole bottle thing I think Solomon had like hundred of bottle in his genie cellar We can credit a lot of how we the west see genie to Arabian Nights Now this episode seems to mostly be concerned with juxtaposing the genie with a fairly typical relatable couple writhing in debt I hold that this wasn an original idea even for it time but it certainly paved the way for many bottle to come From primordial superhumans to Will Smith this is another tale of another genie and the people he messing with And yes it in the Twilight Zone amp x200B Arthur Castle ha to be like the dumbest guy ever Top 10 Dumbest Twilight Zone Protags coming soon to a sub near you Head of a foreign country can be voted out of office within this century Dude aren you Jewish I don think it confirmed whether the character is Jewish but Luther Adler is and he doe have a nice kvetch to his voice Even if I hadn seen that Futurama parody this is beyond predictable I do think that if his character is Jewish it add more horror to the twist but it also make him like really really dumb I get he all caught up on the wish train but he literally trying to make a wish that doesn have consequence when the most obvious of all consequence is right under his nose in a toothbrush mustache And apparently Adler played Hitler twice before this so it might even be an in joke It a strong twist in theory but it sheer obviousness ha it fall flat He totally deserves Genie evil laughter Also it clever that the genie lamp subbed in for the cyanide bottle even though it historically inaccurate That the least of this episode problem I like that Arthur and Edna Castle are genuinely good people Usually the way these story play out is that the wishmaker or wishee is greedy and deserves to be punished for their selfish desire They get carried away but the beginning establishes that they good people who are just trying to get by I don blame them for wishing for a million dollar which would go for 8 million today or the power thing Edna doe feel a little superfluous in all this Arthur doe all the wishing She basically just there to doubt Arthur I guess technically Arthur owns the bottle but still I always appreciated the Twilight Zone minimalism including casting but to have a character that basically doe nothing in an episode with 3 major character is disappointing But enough negativity Arthur generosity to Mrs Gumley is heartwarming and it a little weird that he get punished for this Wait no he doesn Mental scar notwithstanding In fact he gain something he get 5 buck out of the deal and all of his poor friend get bundle of money I know he reset everything but the glass wasn reset until he bumped into it You could suppose that all the money they donated will get magicked away somehow but they end up appreciating what little they have and it still a happy ending at least I also like the antique shop given how minimal the setting usually are especially in the next episode it nice to see a bunch of ornate statue and ceramic and such I think I saw the Holy Grail somewhere It also cement the irony of being surrounded by this extravagant stuff while being on the verge of bankruptcy Also apparently some of the music here is used from What You Need Nice touch I love Joseph Ruskin in this He honestly make the episode I like that the smoke coming out of the bottle at first is implied to be from Genie because he sure drag that cig throughout the entire episode He come off a a subdued salesman like someone who act formal with a vague hint of the sinister You can see a glimmer of amusement a he watch the Castles debate over what to wish for Look at how he beam when Arthur brings up power He know he got a couple of fly in his jaw but he savor every moment before his mouth snap shut His magnanimous act is so convincing that you start to wonder if he genuinely warning them about the inevitable consequence of magic that is until his face freeze in laughter at Arthur boneheaded wish Luther Adler ha a decent performance a well if not a bit hammy The glass wish never backfire Maybe it because it so simple and innocuous but that interesting right It implies that maybe Genie isn a evil a we thought and he be more than happy to grant small meager wish Or maybe he luring them into a false sense of security Oh well it basically just a test wish anyways Guess that why they get 4 It fun that they had a test wish for that suspension of disbelief and the gag time wa pretty short And I guess Genie glass fixing ability foreshadow him fixing his bottle a if that wa something we needed to see amp x200B The worst thing about this episode is that it is predictable a all get out It play out exactly how you expect these wish episode to go with little variation or subversion The twist are predictable too Even if it wa more original in it day I still feel it a weaker episode overall Maybe show it to somebody who literally never seen this type of story ever The protagonist are likable enough and Ruskin performance should keep you entertained Contemporary cultural context doe put a damper on this one a it doe to many classic episode but this is one bottle I could do without I have a feeling there be a lot of review like this so I suppose my wish of peeking at the other side ha been granted,The Groan Zone The Man in the Bottle Review

180,whurpo,TwilightZone,I didn have incredibly high hope for this reboot of the twilight zone but I wanted to give it a shot because I always loved the original show Regardless I been disappointed Peele latest iteration seems to completely miss the point of TZ For one thing it wa never a scary show It been mischaracterized and satirized a a show that creeped people out because of it surreal and suspenseful element but Serling story had heart the message were simple and powerful and the performance were profoundly human Perhaps the greatest thing about it wa that it wa television that made you think Peele is somehow being hailed a a master of horror and story but all I seen so far from the guy is clumsy metaphor and overacted performance by diverse cast His star studded overproduced superficial misinterpretation of the twilight zone come off a more of a vanity project that rather than a medium for producing a tranquil thoughtful audience a the original did and is adding more fuel the ongoing political fire raging in America It feel like any other show except in this dimension Peele comedian friend are acting scary Truthfully I think this is the right time for a twilight zone reboot but i don think Jordan Peele is the right man for the job TLDR Jordan peele shouldn have been the guy to reboot the show What do you think,No Jordan No

211,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,I wanted to contribute my 4 major point to improve this incarnation of the show Before I get into it I want to say I really happy you have brought it back This post isn meant to castigate you clearly putting a lot of effort and I a no one As a fan I hope to be helpful and supportive giving my opinion constructively is the most I can do on that front I fully recognize how difficult it must be to reboot a classic TV show Please don be discouraged because watching it ha been a highpoint of my week and I enjoyed the show besides a few minor quibble complaint Here are 4 major point I think can improve the show Fair warning there are a few small spoiler about the new series ahead 1 The Narration isn just a quirky feature it serf a function The opening and closing narration are essential element of the show It often feel like the TZ reboots have treated the narration portion a an aside or a low effort box to tick before moving on the story As I see it the intro outro purpose is two fold A The intro narration often give u a summation of the character inner world and other perspective we may not have been privy to seeing It characterizes their biggest flaw and their greatest triumph wish and aspiration This set the stage and involves u a an active participant in the show If this is skipped it at great detriment to the viewer B The closing narration often provides u with insight It delivers a message commentary or point toward something we should look for in ourselves or in society It show u that thing we just watched wa a parable and sometimes in 4 or 5 sentence we given the key to unlock it Provide Insight distribute wisdom and let u know the profundity of why it important we understand what you seeking to express 2 The Twists serve to enhance the message and serve the story not vice versa Serling primarily used the show a an avenue to deliver social commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling While not every episode of the original series wa great in the classic episode the twist ending enhances the message of what we just seen When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist and not the other way around you lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone wa trying to teach u To more effectively use a twist we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered If the twist go against the message of the episode or make the message more difficult to interpret I argue it losing some efficacy Additionally not every episode need a twist As long a the writing moral and message are strong and there is an element of the mysterious the will translate to the TZ format 3 Keep it short Pick one message and dive deeply into it I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issue of today i e social division unchecked paranoia artistry v commercialism etc That said one reason the original series wa so successful wa because each episode had one central theme obsoleteness mob mentality racism hatred etc In exploring that central theme deeply the show wa able to touch on other area a well It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issue of our day the viewpoint isn fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dive deeper than the service level I think keeping the episode to 30 35 minute picking a direction and diving deeply into exemplifying the peril of police brutality social division social medium etc will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham fist a many element into each episode a possible Keep tackling the hard topic but focus your scope 4 Don be afraid to use parable Serling wa constricted in what he wa allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the way he told story This constriction proved to be a strength a it allowed him to communicate difficult message to people who otherwise may not have listened Rather than talk about the danger of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil Rather than overtly discus the evil of racism he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark Rather than confront people fear of immigrant he used an alien who came to earth in need of help Rather than well you get the point Serling wa masterful using parable to communicate message that ran deeper than surface level viewing I think using this device would not only enhance the show it would increase conversation and repeat viewing So if anyone reading this is part of making this series I want to say thank you and you off to a great start I look forward to more episode and keep it up Also take with a grain of salt because just my two cent Thank you for reading,Lifelong fan here if anyone who work on the show lurks on this sub

222,jlozier891,TwilightZone,Fuck it I going in head first at this episode I think it called replay I don care enough to check the full title It suck that I have to make this disclaimer but my hatred for the episode ha nothing to do with it theme and meaning TZ ha always had political and social commentary hidden behind the sci fi I think the theme wa both current era appropriate a well a something I think should be discussed The first half of the episode I actually enjoyed The cop wa genuinely scary the main character trying to figure out what happened is a TZ cliche that really doesn annoy me The other half made me want to rip my hair out The entire uncle character should been cut My god that entire scene where they were planning they way into the college felt so out of place I seriously wanted to close the app because I felt like I wa watching a zombie movie Then the climax scene with the police showing up wa just so ridiculously corny The weird triumphant music while the main character speech to evil by using emotion and love wa so incredibly annoying to me It fall so flat because it so unrealistic nobody talk like that in real life A cop or someone who ha such a huge power trip wouldn even bother to register the word coming out of her mouth I hate to put Twilight Zone and Tumblr in the same sentence but that ending could been written by Tumblr and I wouldn be able to tell the difference How could they butcher such a good first part with a pointless ending and an even more pointless epilogue something that further pushed the episode from being a TZ one into a short film I seriously think this entire episode would worked if they made an hour longer fleshed out the uncle character changed the title to something else and completely remove the episode from the Twilight Zone brand and Peeles narration In other word It felt nothing like a Twilight Zone episode,Wow new episode wa just a bad Twilight Zone episode

235,hithere297,TwilightZone,Some ground rule You have to be specific For instance if you say I make the Comedian twenty minute shorter you have to explain what specifically you cut to make the story work within that time frame and why that would make a better story Remember only one change per episode It could be something a small a a single line or something that would drastically alter the entire theme plot It ha to be something you can first sum up in one sentence and then elaborate a need be No excessive negativity I would make episode X not be trash type comment should be ignored If you only have idea for one or two episode feel free to just do those Example this is the thing I change for The Comedian I would cut the nephew character completely I think every other erasure in the episode serf to advance the plot characterization except this one The dog disappearing establishes the premise Joe Donner show that the power could be used for good the mentor show how it could be used for bad the two businessmen show how just far Samir moral have fallen etc The only disappearance that truly feel repetitive IMO is the nephew All it really doe is let Samir understand what happening but I think they easily could had him figure it all out after Donner disappeared and he would had almost exactly the same conversation with his girlfriend afterward a he did after the nephew It would also make Samir more sympathetic in the beginning so his moral decline would feel more powerful Having him shrug off his nephew erasure from existence make him look so much worse than shrugging off the erasure of a guy who killed a mother and child,You allowed to change ONE aspect of each episode of the reboot in order to make it better What would you change

238,CletusVanDamnit,TwilightZone,I been rewatching the series from the beginning and just hit one of my favorite episode The Lateness of the Hour I always thought it looked different than the others but never looked up why until tonight Turns out they were running way over budget on most episode and shot 6 episode on video to save money In the end it wasn enough of a saving and they felt it ruined the look of the show Personally I don really mind the way it look It kind of seems a bit surreal and I don mind it or find it distracting in any way What do you think,Does anyone like the look of the episode shot on video
239,Mary_Pick_A_Ford,TwilightZone,I recently watched it today because I forgot Barry Nelson wa the guest star in it I think the first time I watched it I wa confused on where they were exactly I wa a kid This third time I watching it a an adult it just fall a little flat for me I don really understand why the two of them get picked out out of all the human on Earth by the alien father that is supposedly bigger than Earth a well So are these alien just super gigantic then If that the case why doe the little girl have to have a doll house when she can just play with the live figure on Earth then The moral message the episode keep alluding to is to not drive and drive otherwise some big as alien are going to pick and punish you for it I really love most Twilight Zone episode but this one seemed too much of a stretch JMO Any thought,Does anybody like the episode where the couple is stuck in Circleville
240,Beyonder_94,TwilightZone,This would be quite a cool thing to see Mr Shatner still can knock it out of the park given the right material It would also be a nice bridge between the original and this series,Is there any chance of getting William Shatner to do an all new original story for the upcoming Twilight Zone series
241,Disco_Jones,TwilightZone,My favorite episode are the one where something that doesn make sense within our understanding of reality is happening to one person or a group of people and they end up questioning their own sanity Example episode would be And When The Sky Was Opened my absolute favorite episode A World of Difference Nightmare at 20 000 foot The Hitchhiker and Living Doll Something about these episode just fill me with a sense of dread that I just love Nothing is scarier to me than something so unexplainable happening that the only logical solution is that you either completely insane or the butt end of a highly elaborate fantastically conceived practical joke Anyone have any more episode that fit this general theme Thanks,More episode like these

250,Vault-Tec95,TwilightZone,It just doesn feel like a Twilight Zone episode to me and that would make sense due to it being purchased and not made or written by the Twilight Zone creator Out of all the short film they could have purchased to be a Twilight Zone episode they could have picked a better story that fit in to the Twilight Zone,What do people think of the An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge episode from Season 5

255,hexensabbat,TwilightZone,Hello I been binge watching this wonderful show the past few day and despite watching and enjoying this show all throughout my life I hadn really sat down and really given the writing my full attention It is really mind blowing how well most of the episode hold up and how relevant they still remain today and how emotionally effective many of them are My favorite script ha been that of Eye of the Beholder a well a the performance of the lead actress her vocal acting some is incredible However one line from another episode really grabbed me with it beauty The intro to the episode A Passage for Trumpet Joey Crown musician with an odd intense face whose life is a quest for impossible thing like flower in concrete or like trying to pluck a note of music out of the air and put it under glass to treasure I replayed that last line several time I don know what it is but that music metaphor and how it wa delivered are just so beautiful to me The episode itself also affected me quite a bit For anyone who hasn seen it it is about a downtrodden trumpet player in NYC struggling with alcoholism and becoming suicidal As someone who ha dealt with those feeling before it felt like I wa meant to watch it I felt for Joey and enjoyed the message of the ep Anyway with that said What are your favorite line from the series Or which episode overall did you enjoy the writing of the most,Favorite line from The Twilight Zone

292,Typical_Humanoid,TwilightZone,Don get me wrong I think it a top tier episode but I try to covertly distract people from looking at the title whenever I show them the episode because Earth is what will inevitably come to mind when you hear this phrase and that not what you want to draw attention to a far a this story go But I actually didn catch on my first time and wa stupefied by the twist frankly so I torn if I overthinking this or not,Does anybody else think Third From The Sun title is a bit too spoilery for comfort
293,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Well isn it I mean just look at the evidence 1 Something deadly happens to the main character Hyder Simpson within the first few minute of this episode he drowned in a lake running after his dog 2 He return the next morning and realizes that nobody talking to him He of course think he being ignored and doesn clue in it because the living and dead aren meant to interact they can see or hear one another and have no clue that he there 3 He see the people digging a grave for his dog Rip RIP Rest In Peace He try to talk to them and later shoot them what would have happened if he pulled the trigger Would just air and dust dissipate and nothing else Or would have forfeited his chance for heaven altogether a he wa trying to kill people thou shalt not kill remember 4 He try several time to talk to his wife to no avail It turn out Hyder Simpson and Rip are no longer alive at the very end and unable to go back to the land of the living 5 Hyder follows the pall bearer bearing a coffin asking who in it but now he mostly talking to his dog Instead of finding the cemetery he find the other gate 6 Hyder Simpson and his dog Rip died during the night but neither know it 7 The episode end with Hyder Simpson walking his dog up to heaven with him finally at peace having accepted that it is what it is and he is dead and finished with life on earth He at peace and acceptance amp x200B In short Dr Malcolm Crow from The Sixth Sense went through all of these same situation since the start of the movie The Sixth Sense I know M Knight admitted that The Sixth Sense wasn even his own idea he stole the inspiration from Are You Afraid Of The Dark Dream Girl but yes the side by side comparison is uncanny and it fit with only a few minor infraction Instead of almost attempting to shoot people Dr Malcolm Crow actually break the glass on the door of his wife jewelry store Instead of seeing people digging a grave and grabbing coffin Dr Crow and Cole attend someone funeral together And Dr Crow had no pet And it is possible that Rip The Dog no offense to Cole The Kid since Cole could see ghost and dead people all the time and knew Dr Crow wa dead all along through a variety of scene without dialogue even though Dr Crow didn know he wa dead and it turned out it wa Cole mission to help Dr Crow move onto the other side with ease Similarly Rip could see right through the phony gate and Hyder didn want to separate from him and if he did The Late Hyder Simpson would have ended up in hell instead of heaven and that wa Rip Mission but then again Cole had a pet dog of his own named Sebastian who seemed to have a sixth sense with haunted apartment a well I think that evidence is concrete What do you all think,The Hunt Is that plot the exact same a The Sixth Sense or What

296,aTVisAthingTOwatch,TwilightZone,Is it just me or is this episode overrated I not saying it wa bad for it time but to me it just doesn hold up very well The acting is pretty exaggerated and the scene without any music are just absolutely cringy This is just my opinion though would love to know your guy thought,The Invaders
297,adamswebster,TwilightZone,So the first episode wa a guy loosing it on a plane when he see a gremlin thing on the wing This one didn really mess with me but I think it would be fun to watch The second wa this dream eater reaper thing that would come out of the wall and kill you in your sleep this one really got to me a a kid and I had nightmare for year The last one is about people who are trapped in a bin of some kind of bin and it end with them turning into toy or were toy all along I don remember Any help would be greatly appreciated,I think I watched some episode a a kid and wa wondering if someone could tell me witch they were

299,borbafett1,TwilightZone,nan,I tired Off to bed Someone pick an episode for me to watch in bed Ready go
300,borbafett1,TwilightZone,Was how old the character in the episode wa according to Rod narration 9 time out of 10 it so and so mid 30 when clearly the actor or actress is at least 50 It probably safe to assume Serling wrote the age of each character in the script but it baffling why he wouldn change that line based on how old the actor wa Anyway The whole series and almost every episode is still at 10 10 Can wait for April 1,The one thing about The Twilight Zone I always felt wa mildly infuriating a bit
301,Mystery-time-lady,TwilightZone,I think it a toss up between time enough at last because I really connected with him and he didn deserve that but the second one would have to be kick the can the ending once again get me I value friendship and the event of being left behind really packed a punch which episode got your eye tearing up,What do you think are the saddest episode of the classic era
302,Gaming-Atlas,TwilightZone,nan,Can someone please help me pick a random episode to watch
303,Secular-By-Nature,TwilightZone,In this episode an old man who is awaiting his death portrayed loosely a a vampire or is he just telling the kid that befriends a young boy whose family would later mutate into monster and kill the man I looked all over the internet for analysis of this episode to no avail but my take is that it portraying how old people are seen a a burden leech vampire to some people and many are just waiting to die while the family who seems to love them in the daytime are actually the same people who will check them into a dark dreary nursing home to die which is why the people are equated with monster who kill the old man Thoughts,The Twilight Zone 1985 S01E15 Monsters thought
304,PaperMachetedHeart,TwilightZone,This episode really get under my skin They had a pretty solid plan However I always wondered why De Cruz eliminated their sole form of transportation by not only killing Brooks but also jumping out of the car only for it to go off a cliff and essentially become totalled I understand his animosity towards Brooks and how he wanted to kill him but why also ruin the car in the process Watching them trek through the blazing California desert with little water supply is so daunting and very painful The whole episode just dragged on Thoughts anyone,The Rip Van Winkle Caper

312,xeshaka,TwilightZone,So when I wa a wee lad I remember watching an episode of the Twilight Zone that I really enjoyed but after fruitless google search cannot seem to find the name of The main protagonist wa a Senator who wa investigating some sort of company campus where weird stuff wa happening As the show progress the people at this site start to stonewall him and he start demanding answer to his question a he is a US Senator and they are required to answer him That about all I remember I don even remember how it end but I never forget being surprised that a Senator had those kind investigative power Almost like he wa a detective Anyways any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated Thanks,Help me find an episode
313,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,For me it the theme of isolation identity and loneliness which are present in some way in almost every episode,What make an episode of The Twilight Zone different from other episode of anthology show
314,mindfullman,TwilightZone,Hi those interested in the reboot I just been cast a a background actor a an angry man who is one of many men only affected by a meteor shower and causing mayhem in a nice small eastern coast town Some of the woman are affected by uncontrollable fear and some men are affected by uncontrollable anger There are car being flipped building being burned the army is being called in Filming is on Jan 31 Should be fun,Reboot thingie
315,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,I talking about the big tall wish I get that he supposed to be a washed out boxer who had a rough life outside of the ring but he wa just so negative and sour all of the time plus he almost broke his entire hand by attempting to punch someone and commit violence in the locker room so besides being hot tempered he just wasn that smart This episode had the making to be something epic Muhammad Ali VS Joe Frazier style but it just fell flat because he wa so unlikable and in the ring he wa just standing there while his opponent waled and rained down punch on him just before the fight wa over Henry make the wish and the opponent and Bolie switch place and suddenly Bolie win Nobody except Bolie can recall how the fight began I guess if Henry went ahead and asked the opponent what really happened and what his recollection wa it would open a plot hole but that neither here nor there when he tried to tamper with Henry freewill by telling Henry that he too old to believe in magic let Henry believe a he chooses Bolie He is just so unsympathetic especially by the end of the episode when that happened,Does anyone else not like Bolie
316,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Honestly in the split second we saw of them I cared more about them than our three astronaut who we all know just wanted to find their way home Clearly do the people who take to forum and complain that the beauty queen wa homely and unattractive Did they miss the episode Eye Of The Beholder and Number 12 Looks Just Like You Enough said with that analogy and who to say that someone else definition of beauty is wrong How do we know that the astronaut who wa complimenting her and her Plain Jane librarian look doesn actually like his girl homely and unattractive Not everybody is attracted to supermodel some like their woman to be on the plain side and others like woman who are ugly Maybe he see beauty in what plain and if that wa the case then that would make me like him and not care one way or another about his two friend Now obviously the girl in beauty queen segment always wanted to be beautiful when she wa alive didn happen couldn afford plastic surgery so she stipulated in her will that she be placed on display winning a Miss America competition while her more beautiful contestant lose and look on in envy So what wrong with that Who wa the mayor anyways We know he wasn even really a mayor official or a person in charge of anything What wa he like when he wa alive and isn his story worth telling Was he a young man who wa constantly beaten down and bullied and only escaped a a man about town or a man in demand in his own fantasy Clearly he wanted to be celebrated and in charge in life never got the chance so why not have it in death He cast one shadow of mystery that could never be uncloaked and the clock with no hand signifies he never leave office after election This wa his fantasy so why did it come to that Why not ask to be president or a king or a sultan How badly wa he bullied in life and did he ever lash out Seems he cared more about being celebrated loved adored and appreciated in life and it never came to fruition so why not get it after death Both of them definitely paint a tragic picture when you look deep into the episode,Elegy question Why is everybody so hard on the poor homely girl corpse winning the beauty pageant and on the one corpse constantly being elected mayor for all eternity

319,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,If you bothered coming to this subreddit you probably know that the whole reason Serling started appearing on camera for intro and outros from the second season on wa that it got a good reception when he did it at the end of the final first season episode A World of His Own I surprised they didn try to finish off Season 5 with an episode where they do something where Serling go from being effectively the host to a character in the show They give some sort of hint why he able to appear unnoticed in these story why he brings the Twilight Zone with him etc It feel like it could be equally well played for horror or laugh It not like it would have been too unusual at the time since Jack Benny program had been pretty popular for awhile and it wa a meta show I know by then they were sort of running on fume but even if they bungled it the idea seems like it would have made for a memorable episode anyway,A meta episode I surprised they didn do
320,Trogdor_98,TwilightZone,I just finished rewatching The Monsters are Due on Maple Street and I realized something I hadn noticed before The episode is about how often the true monster are doubt prejudice and fear The whole story revolves on the fact that no one is really attacking the earth but none the le the people are searching for someone to blame and the devolve into a mob who hunt and murder eachother before pointing the next finger For this myself and many others feel this is one of the best episode turning the focus from the supernatural to the frightening reality of the cold war Unfortunately what ruin it is the fact that the ending show that there ARE alien manipulating everything meaning that while they were targeting the wrong people they weren wrong and their initial suspension wa correct This ruin the WHOLE message of the episode,The Monsters are Due on Maple Street One of the best AND worst episode of the Twilight Zone

326,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,The female protagonist truly got betrayed by the male friend she meet at the bus station That true right It sad because he start off being kind and gentle unlike the baggage station clerk who just kept yelling at her but she talk to him get to know him and all that then he decides to wait it out and catch the next bus and stay with her He the one who called 911 and had her arrested Had her committed after being so kind to her initially That is what betrayal is At least he got his comeuppance when the same thing happened to him and he literally had to chase himself out of the bus station and interestingly enough wa unable to catch himself Meanwhile that show the episode never ended and wa never resolved On the other hand Good Riddance Some handsome stranger you just can trust,Okay let me get this straight In the episode Mirror Image
327,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Let see 1 First there the original well done twilight zone with pig people and a beautiful face under bandage making for a compelling plot about loving all people It could be looked at a a case of discrimination 2 SNL I don know whether or not anyone remembers or if it should count or not a canon since it wa just a sketch and a spoof but Pamela Anderson did it She wa the girl under the bandage and we got a chance to see what the pig mask look like in color they take off the bandage to reveal Pamela Anderson but instead of being put off and horrified all the male doctor fall in love with her and the female doctor look around and say What going on I don get it what happening I can forget this qoute It be hard for me to go home to my pig faced wife after seeing her 3 2002 Twilight Zone Same title same name different host Forest Whitaker This is awkward to say the least No pig mask no pig people no pigmayllion Maybe this episode wa to help Forest Whitaker through his disability but it insensitive to people who actually have suffered a stroke Well he suffered a left eye ptosis and that carry some similar symptom but not on the extreme level of a stroke Anyways the ugly people have face that look like they melting One of their eye is permanently closed and they carry themselves a stroke victim too and the entire episode just play on the same like I said this one is awkward No wonder Twilight Zone 2002 wa cancelled so quickly amp x200B Let me know if I missed any,How many time ha Eye of the beholder been done and recreated

330,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Because I do I find that The Twilight Zone run more smoothly and episode are much more enjoyable when they have nothing to do with the military because then thing take on a serious realistic tone instead of one fantasy and science fiction I mean they could have even made a few mild mention about a military existing but they should not have had it center on air force base and army recruit it just brings everything down for me I noticed the same thing whenever I watch The Twilight Zone in color and The Twilight Zone 2002 so sometimes thing never change no matter how much you redoctor it up,Does anyone else avoid all of the military themed episode
331,Vault-Tec95,TwilightZone,Shot in Black and White and on 35mm film Having the right clothes and product for the decade Even down to the ad being done by the host Personally I think it a good idea and I think it would be a good nod to the original,Would anyone be up for even one episode being made like it still the 60

333,Bran_Yaltz,TwilightZone,So I don know how all of this subreddit feel but I excited From what I can tell the other revival failed because they did not have a strong authorial voice behind them Get Out felt like a long Twilight Zone episode to the point that when I saw it I said to a friend I would only get excited for a Twilight Zone reboot if he headed it up Of course he not Rod Serling he Jordan Peele It going to be different but I think it gonna be really good Anyway what do you guy think,I real excited for Jordan Peele the Twilight Zone
334,Smerphy,TwilightZone,The two are constantly compared but they not identical Black Mirror is too intent on explaining everything while Twilight Zone prefers to leave most thing unexplained which leaf more of an opening for creativity The more satirical episode of BM are great but more recently they been trying to be a realistic a possible and realism ha never been Charlie Brooker strong suit Hoping the new Twilight Zone can delve into social issue and ethical question while remaining in the Sci Fi Fantasy genre,Hoping this show doesn just become an American version of Black Mirror with the name Twilight Zone
335,Myson91,TwilightZone,I remember being young when it came on and not having the same kind of wonder I had watching the original series but it been so long I couldn tell you why What your take on it What I somewhat remember wa so vast majority of remake that didn really add anything to the original just a colorized le profound version,What were some of the biggest reason why the 2002 series flopped
336,Perrlock,TwilightZone,Does anyone know where I can find these episode to other then YouTube the quality is horrible on there,Twilight zone 2002 series
337,AwfulMajesticEtc,TwilightZone,Rewatching the original series The first episode Where is Everybody end with a man looking up at the moon saying some day we be up there Cut to Rod Serling who announces Ed Wynn actor comedian is up against the devil in the next episode Buzz Aldrin real first name is Edwin Conspiracy flat Earth etc etc,Prophetic coincidence in episode 1 1959
338,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,Personally I think they both pretty good I never thought the original wa one of TZ best episode I probably put thirty maybe thirty five episode ahead of it Don get me wrong it excellent TV But I just feel better TZ episode out there exist With that said the Shatner version is superior to the Lithgow version in that it ha more psychological depth However I think the remake is better directed and feature a more convincing gremlin So I guess it a draw for me amp x200B What about you,Which version of Nightmare at Twenty Thousand Feet do you prefer the one with Shatner or the one with Lithgow

341,Happy2BeHere2day,TwilightZone,Watched the most recent MOVIE FIGHTS episode on the Screen Junkies YouTube channel and one of the question wa Which classic Twilight Zone episode would make the best movie The three fighter chose The Eye of the Beholder Nightmare at 20 000 Feet and The Purple Testament The winner wa ultimately The Purple Testament Someone suggested Time Enough at Last a well Personally I think It a Good Life would make the best movie Unlike other Twilight Zone episode the conflict isn resolved at the end Anthony is still able to terrorize Peaksville Ohio with his power That why I think a movie could be able to expand on that another hour plus of Anthony causing mischief and the people of Peaksville trying to create a plan to stop him You could put the episode at the beginning of the movie and go from there So I ask you what TZ episode do you think would make the best movie,Which classic Twilight Zone episode would make the best movie

344,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,Even with a few awkward moment along the way to me this is the most emotionally powerful episode of the show From the beginning where the grandmother is clingy possessive of Billy a broadly a it played it still manages to convey the mix of creepiness sadness and vulnerability someone in her position provides The fact Billy parent refuse to explain to him what happening to his grandmother establishes the theme of the episode the denial of death perfectly The way that we never hear the grandmother voice come through the toy phone Billy us to speak to her is perfect in adding ambiguity to the episode that made it more resonant for me We don know what on the other side and not making it explicit is utterly appropriate Phillip Abbot If you love him let him live monologue is the best moment of the show for me It where the hook of TZ at it best ordinary people in extraordinary circumstance come most alive to me because it possibly the most nakedly someone break down in the face of the potentially supernatural circumstance they find themselves in It a guy talking on a toy telephone to someone he shouldn believe is there it so undignified and yet the moment is so committed to that I can tear up thinking about it The insignificant thing that he list off that Billy will never experience if his potentially desperately lonely grandmother keep tap into some really primal emotion for me I can even fully imagine the grandmother a she let go and feel some inkling of how painful that would be By the end it doesn even feel like it a story about ghost and the supernatural It about confronting and accepting the loss of loved one reaffirming life even in the face of the inevitable death we don want to confront Even shot on ugly video it so beautiful,Spoilers I going to gush about Long Distance Call

386,Prometheus357,TwilightZone,Okay I just want to say I have been a long time fan of the Zone which inevitably lead me to The Gallery which led me to Serling himself and his work I wanted to get more Serling Patterns amp Requiem for a Heavyweight came next and I still wa gluttonous for more I bought every book that I could find in hope to dig deeper into his Radio Catalog his Teleplay Catalog etc then His film beyond Planet of the Apes Seven Days in May etc then there a book out just recently Rod Serling His Life His Work His Imagination and boy oh boy is this pretty darn close to having his fully body of work it 500 page but it isn intimidating at all it a clean and smooth read with synopsis of nearly everything else ever committed to the page And TZ only cover 1 5 of the page in this book I urge folk in this sub to pick it up reading over my post this doe seem like an ad but it not I promise I just really love this man work a lot of writer talk about their mission to write about the human condition but rod work really nail it and it a crime that his work isn more readily available for the mass because all of it is still relevant today it still speaks to those who think themselves a the obsolete man The disenchanted the lonely the brave the bold the strange the beautiful and the weird his work is parable not of his time but our time I hope that the more folk pick this up the more it will show his estate that there is an interest in Rod work beyond that middle ground between light and shadow beyond that pit of man fear and above that summit of knowledge that dimension of imagination and that area which we call the Twilight Zone,The work of Rod Serling
387,Jakesta7,TwilightZone,Whether they get you in that winter mood or the setting of the episode just happens to be during the winter,What are your favorite winter themed episode
388,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,So far I watched the town that turned to dust the arena and the time element on YouTube I enjoyed all of them so far The most TZ like is the Time Element because of the sci fi vibe The other 2 are great in their own regard but more for their social commentary and insight into the human condition If you haven seen these and have some extra time this weekend give a search on youtube you may enjoy them,On my thanksgivingday break I been watching some pre twilight zone Serling show figured the people of this sub also enjoy
389,WorkOrange,TwilightZone,Why did they add this character in the second season An ease into commercial break or something It break the flow of the story for me,The Narrator
390,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,This is an episode from Season 4 I can say it bad Really bad Before you read my analysis go watch it I not going to explain the plot because I don understand the plot I give you a quick summary One guy stop for gas in a small town that guarding the secret of magical alien technology that can do essentially anything and they detain him because he know their secret That it Let me say why it bad The character make bad decision Say everyone in your town ha some magical Alien technology and you trying to keep it secret What the best way to keep a secret like that This town ha a completely OPEN ROAD leading into it They simply assume that due to their remote location NOBODY will ever wander in and stop for gas or food Is this stupid Yes It is established that these people can produce any food they want any object they want They have no lack of resource and nobody ever leaf they perfectly content SO WHY DO THEY HAVE AN UNGUARDED ENTRANCE INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD This would make sense Put a log in the middle of the road or a big rock so people can drive through and a sign that say Road Closed Not their big giant magical invisible forcefield a this would arouse suspicion but just a barrier that make it seem like there nothing notable back there Chances are they could just fade into obscurity like that But they have a SIGN right outside This is like if Area 51 had a day where you could come in and take all the picture of alien you wanted These people are so bad at keeping a secret and then they imprison this guy just because he happened to pick out their town at random But it go even farther than that When he first get to the town this kid us her magical alien technology to make the guy dog disappear The guy wonder how his dog disappeared and he see the kid playing with the techno thingy but her dad the gas station attendant say it just her radio and then she make his dog come back Now this seems like a reasonable excuse The guy assumes that maybe his dog just ran off somewhere for a minute and maybe it is just a radio So he drive off THIS IS A SMART CHOICE By this point the guy doesn care He ha his gas and his dog If the townspeople just let him go he WOULD NOT CARE or think about visiting this town EVER AGAIN He a newspaper reporter but he wouldn report his dog running away in some little town Seems like the townspeople have managed to keep their secret right NOPE They raise their HUGE INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD and his car literally CRASHES INTO NOTHING then his dog DIES then the townspeople bring his dog BACK TO LIFE These people do not want to be thought of a normal or hide a secret This is clear They want to be a bizarre a possible This is the only thing I can conceive of Are they idiot Dorn the mayor state in the episode that they not really evil they just want to keep their secret They don want to keep him there but they have to in order to keep their secret But he say he a prominent reporter and people will come looking for him Won they Yes they will Dorn call it the best kept secret in the world Is it Is it really You leave your town wide open you act insane and you so obviously hiding something These people just want to stand out They can sorta want to hide their secret but also keep an open connection to the outside world It one or the other The town ha a hotel and a restaurant but they not real The hotel is supposedly completely booked but all the guest are out and the restaurant is ALWAYS CLOSED Why doe the gas station work then Why would these people need gas if they never go anywhere and can have all the food they want Does this town NEED all these totally fake business everywhere to make their town seem more normal It would seem more normal to have NO restaurant or hotel than to have restaurant and hotel that ARE FAKE Some town have no restaurant or hotel They could just tell him we don have a restaurant or a hotel so you have to go somewhere else He leave Easy But that isn the worst part The worst part is at the end of the episode THEY REALIZE THAT THEY CAN JUST ERASE HIS MEMORY with their technology and restore everything back to normal so he won know what happened This render all the prior conflict completely pointless Also we supposed to feel sad that he doesn know the lady anymore It would be sad if she wa his wife BEFORE he entered the town and she had to stay there I not invested in their romance He just some random guy and she just some random lady and she betrayed him anyway and if they go their separate way then so what It a happy ending Overall this episode is bad Serling and Co really struck out with this one Twilight Zone episode are good when he character do believable thing We cheer on the people when they leave Pall imaginary apocalypse we praise Templeton when he decides to pursue his passion we identify with the guy who alone with nobody but his reflection to speak with Those are good episode This episode is bad because nobody doe anything that make sense It could be good if it wa executed properly like if the townspeople really did try to keep their technology a secret and did everything in their power to help this poor guy escape Dorn say that the last time anybody wandered in it wa 1953 What happened to that guy Did they turn his car into Spaghetti Os and then tell him nothing wa bizarre,Valley Of The Shadows suck

418,annabelltaylor2019,TwilightZone,So in this hypothetical situation you would be transported to the setting in the episode that your character appears in You can choose to play out the entire episode or just certain scene from it However everything that occurs in the episode also happens to you there no changing anything to your added benefit You can also choose to leave the episode setting and return to your normal life at any time Which character would you like to experience being for a short time I would personally choose Henry J Fate from Mr Denton on Doomsday You get to help out a down on his luck Al Denton and having access to all those potion and tonic seems cool Other fun choice to me are Gabriel from A Passage for Trumpet being an angel and a great musician Frisby coming up with crazy story and actually being abducted by alien and Gregory West being able to make anything come to life by describing it,Which twilight zone character would you like to be
