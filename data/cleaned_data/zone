27,OneTrueBrody,TwilightZone,Hooooooooo boy Season Four is the most infamous one of the series thanks to the controversial decision to have hour long episode Some people think that The Twilight Zone wasn meant to have anything but half hour episode but I of the mind that hour long episode could have worked if done properly A longer runtime provides more opportunity to expand upon a concept or spend more time on character development So did Season Four take advantage of the runtime to create compelling television For the most part no I gonna come out and say it there only ONE episode of the entire season that needed to be an hour long That not to say there weren other episode that I consider good or even great but when the runtime becomes an issue for nearly every episode there is a serious problem Full disclosure I took a break from writing this because I wa starting to feel burnt out and I realized I wa just repeating myself because I have very little to say about most of these episode I coming back to this after a few week so this isn going to be the most detailed list I done partially because I blanking on some specific part of these episode and partially because I just want to get this over with and move on to Season 5 Anyway on with the show 18 The Bard A lot of the bad Season Four episode are bad in a way that isn even interesting to talk about and there isn a whole lot to say about The Bard besides it suck Burt Reynolds chewing the scenery is the only thing worth enjoying in this piece of shit episode that feel like Rod Serling wa trying to pull a fast one on the network executive and sponsor that meddled with his script I all for a bit of meta commentary but the episode ha to be good for the commentary to land and The Bard is about a far from good a an episode can get Plenty of Twilight Zone episode leave me with unanswered question but all I left with here is why doe William Shakespeare feel the need to quote himself and cite the specific line he referencing like a 10th grade English student I don even want to talk about the absolutely meaningless story if I said a failed writer conjures William Shakespeare to write script for him and made you come up with a story in your head whatever you come up with would probably have more direction than The Bard This episode would have sucked a a half hour affair but being an hour long made it nothing short of insufferable On that note I want to point out that Rod Serling may be the king of half hour television but he seemed to struggle with the hour long format of Season Four and it show in The Bard 17 I Dream of Genie Some episode get criticized for not feeling like a Twilight Zone episode and I never understood that complaint The Twilight Zone ha episode ranging from Eye of the Beholder to Once Upon a Time to A Passage For Trumpet nothing off the table really But with I Dream of Genie I totally get it The Twilight Zone element is minimal at best 90 of it is just a dude daydreaming about what his wish would be I didn actively dislike it Howard Morris is entertaining enough to make the time pas but there nothing in this episode that feel like something out of The Twilight Zone There no social commentary no relationship with the paranormal or supernatural no spectacular writing hell it doesn even have the hacky shoddiness that the bad episode are known for As for the episode we did get it just a series of vignette with nothing worth talking about 16 Passage on the Lady Anne While Passage on the Lady Anne is far from the most well liked Season 4 episode I seem to be in the minority of people who outright despise it Some people like it for it character development it an episode more focused on it character than it concept On some level I can appreciate that and I would definitely call Alan and Elaine well developed character but a huge part of why The Twilight Zone work for me is the concept it explores and how the concept help fuel the character development story message pathos etc The concept of Passage on the Lady Anne is so poorly developed that I don even know how to describe it The idea of the ship having supernatural element is barely explored until the ending when we just told that the Lady Anne died on her way back to her home planet As for the plot it just a bunch of scene that are hardly connected in any meaningful way For example the McKenzies say that Alan and Elaine don have to die before an ad break and when we return it never brought up again We treated to a whole bunch of half assed treatise on love and how the old way are being done away with but it all so unfocused that I couldn get a read on any sort of story they were telling besides Alan and Elaine marriage being in shamble I say it right now Charles Beaumont wrote 6 episode this season and this is far and away his only bad one 15 Of Late I Think of Cliffordville Twilight Zone actor who star in more than one episode are almost always fantastic actor Jack Klugman Burgess Meredith John Anderson etc Albert Salmi is an exception Of all the actor who have appeared in three or more episode he one of the only one I can think of that wa never all that good in any of them He never outright terrible but he never elevates any episode that he in Case in point Of Late I Think of Cliffordville It funny a commercial came on before this episode telling me to think about my eye and maybe I should have taken that to heart because the old age makeup Salmi had to wear wa painful to look at I know the show wa fighting against budget restraint but they were able to pull it off in Long Live Walter Jameson so there no excuse Pretty much every episode with a deal with the devil story ha an idiot for a main character but Feathersmith is a special kind of idiot Part of that ha to do with the character not being written all that well but part of that also ha to do with Albert Salmi not having the charisma to make this character work onscreen Salmi famously hated film TV acting that may have something to do with it Julie Newmar and John Anderson are great but their talent are wasted because they play second banana to Salmi who never should have been in this role in the first place With a different lead actor I may have liked it more but I doubt it 14 No Time Like the Past What could have been a decent half hour episode wa turned into a pointless hour of television Paul Driscoll can change the past This is a lesson that wa learned in the first twenty minute when he couldn evacuate Hiroshima like five fucking minute before the bomb drop kill Hitler or change the course of the Lusitania again five minute before it get torpedoed yet somehow this episode managed to last fifty goddamn minute He not unable to change the past because the past is written in stone he unable to change the past because he a fucking moron Those first twenty minute were absolutely irrelevant this episode could have started with Paul going to 1881 to stop Garfield assassination and moved on from there and nothing would have been different That probably wouldn have saved No Time Like the Past the acting wa pretty lackluster throughout especially from Abby and the writing isn all that inspired outside of some FANTASTIC dialogue during the dinner scene The dinner scene is the only scene I actually enjoyed it wa the only moment in the entire episode where Serling showed u why he one of the best writer in the history of television It a scene so good that it genuinely baffling how much the rest of the episode suck 13 The Incredible World of Horace Ford The Incredible World of Horace Ford shouldn have been an hour long episode I enjoyed about 10 15 minute worth of material which would have been thin even for a half hour episode but with a runtime of over an hour it damn near interminable This episode wa full of filler so many theme and scene were repeated nearly verbatim and it just got old I also really didn like his mother it would have been cool if she wa similar to the mother in Young Man Fancy but she given no character so she add nothing to the story That not to say nothing worked in this episode I love the idea of Horace Ford a a character but he the type of character who work best in small dos so following him for an hour got pretty grating I also thought the story they told wa pretty good it ha shade of Walking Distance and the aforementioned Young Man Fancy but the execution really suffers due to the runtime With one exception no other Season 4 episode suffers more from it runtime the part I did enjoy were dragged on too long and the rest of the episode is pure filler 12 Mute The premise of a little girl losing the only people that she could communicate with is one worth exploring and if Mute stuck to that it would have been fantastic The part of the episode that do line up with that premise are the best part like the time when she read people mind and especially the moment when she reflects on how she learned about boat without word More of that would have been nice but the story end up being a bit of a mess Not a complete mess but there wa too much drama for it own good Cora burning the letter wa dumb and selfish and I don like how that decision doesn bite her in the as at all in the end I totally get her motivation but this aspect of the episode wa really unnecessary Mommy issue wa a really weird recurring theme this season and I don understand why because it wa never good This is an episode that really didn need to be an hour long even immediately after watching it I didn have a whole lot to say about it 11 Jess Belle I can believe I saying this but I really liked Jess Belle Yes I enjoyed one of the episode that almost universally considered bottom ten material Were there problem though Absolutely Earl Hamner wrote this script in about a week with absolutely no revision and boy doe it show This episode could have ended with Jaguar Jess being killed by Billy Ben but we had to add one of the most tacked on ending the show ever produced This wa a story that should have been no more than 25 minute there wasn a whole lot of filler so to speak but the story really didn need to be extended to an hour There also a bit of a tone problem despite how absolutely ridiculous the story can get it all weirdly melodramatic Speaking of how ridiculous this episode get I don think I ever laughed harder in my life than I did when Jess Belle turned into a damn leopard Despite all that working against the episode I did enjoy it The plot could have been executed a lot better but I liked the story they were trying to tell Part of that had to do with the rather engaging performance especially from Billy Ben The set design wa gorgeous I don know why but when this show try to go for a southern charm I seem to like it more than most fan It easy to see this episode for all the flaw that it objectively ha but it just a easy to forget that this isn one of those episode where absolutely nothing work 10 The Thirty Fathom Grave When Rod Serling clearly had trouble filling the new runtime take a shot every time I say this and you be dead which is a damn shame because a lot of the episode he wrote could have been classic in a different season The Thirty Fathom Grave feel like two half hour episode that were loosely connected at best In one story we have Chief Bell having a bout of PTSD and in the other we have the mystery of the sunken submarine Either would have made for an excellent episode on their own but combining them together didn bring out anything special Simon Oakland performance a Captain Beecher wa the highlight he added some much needed weight to this overly long slow affair 9 Miniature Every season of The Twilight Zone ha one fan favorite that I just can get behind Season One ha Mirror Image Season Two ha The Silence Season Three ha Five Characters in Search of an Exit and representing Season Four is Miniature That not to say Miniature is bad but there nothing here that I haven seen in other episode There are reason why it a fan favorite though and I imagine a lot of that ha to do with Robert Duvall performance a Charlie Charlie is a well meaning yet socially awkward oddball and Duvall performance is heartfelt without losing the weirdness that make Charlie stand out I don really think the miniature gimmick wa all that creative but the cinematography make the dollhouse scene my favorite in the episode Where this episode begin to lose me is it story So many episode have plot that could be boiled down to a man doesn fit in with the world around him so he loses himself in one of his own creation but those story are only ever interesting to me when they break from that formula like in A Stop at Willoughby Miniature come very close to doing something special with the formula by having some scene in the dollhouse reflect event in Charlie life but I never felt like they committed to that premise For example it felt like the girl in the dollhouse getting abused could have been a metaphor for his sister relationship with her boyfriend but moment like those are rare and don ultimately play into the ending This wasn a bad episode at all I just don see it a the best episode of Season 4 8 Printer Devil There only so many way to tell a deal with the devil story for the most part once you seen one you seen em all That really not the case with Printer Devil which feel like a fresh take on an old format The audience is told right away that Smith is the devil but Winston doesn know what up until it almost too late On one hand it frustrating seeing Winston so slow to pick up on his situation on the other hand it creates an interesting dynamic between Smith and Winston with Smith using Winston ignorance to his advantage I don think I ever seen a Faustian bargain ending with the devil being beaten at his own game but that exactly what happens here Speaking of Smith this wa Burgess Meredith last Twilight Zone episode and he couldn have gone out on a higher note I don think the episode had problem filling out the hour but it still feel like two half hour script combined into one take an episode about a printer that predicts the future and an episode about a deal with the devil and you have Printer Devil That not really a complaint but it felt worth mentioning Also I loved the visual presentation of this episode especially that shot of Smith reflection in the window 7 The Parallel I wa a huge fan of The Parallel when I first watched it but I not a high on it now a I wa The concept is simple but brillaint and they do an amazing job of showing off the subtle difference between the parallel universe I love how subtle the difference were for the most part it drive home the fact that this universe is close enough to the one Robert call home but this isn where he belongs this wouldn have been a impactful if the parallel universe had alien roaming around or something crazy like that The acting is superb especially from Robert and his family and I love how the truth behind Robert situation is lightly hinted at until the President Kennedy revelation at the end of the first half Once it clear that Robert is in a parallel universe the episode expands on this and take the story absolutely nowhere This episode had the making of a masterpiece with shade of Little Girl Lost And When the Sky Was Opened Shadow Play and other tense yet low key episode Instead the second half just repeat information that we already learned in the first half then Robert sort of just end up back in his original dimension I mentioned that Horace Ford suffers the most from it runtime with one exception and The Parallel is that exception the story started losing steam after thirty minute and it clearly did not have the leg to go another twenty It a shame because in a just world with a shorter runtime this could have been an all time classic 6 In His Image In His Image wa the first episode of Season 4 and this wa our introduction to the new runtime I talked a lot about the limitation of the longer runtime but In His Image doe a fine job showcasing the strength of the new format Walter and Alan are the central character in a story that echo Frankenstein and the theme that Beaumont explores are given plenty of time to breath throughout the hour without outstaying their welcome I immediately had flashback to The Chaser once I saw George Grizzard but he doe a stellar job of portraying the creator and his creation Some people have described the episode a an example of queer coding from the day when homosexuality in medium wa taboo I not sure how much I subscribe to that theory but it definitely an interesting take on the concept of creating a flawless version of yourself Overall more episode in Season 4 should have used In His Image a an example for how to make an hour long Twilight Zone episode 5 Valley of the Shadow Peaceful Valley ha been blessed with universe altering technology but they don trust humanity to use it wisely There are so many ethical question brought up in this episode that it leaf you questioning whether anyone involved is fully right or fully wrong Many Charlie Beaumont episode end with an it wa just a dream kind of ending Sometimes it work like in Shadow Play sometimes it feel cheap like in Person or Persons Unknown but in Valley of the Shadow having Redfield wake up back at the gas station wa the perfect way to end this story Redfield doe the right thing by escaping to share their technology with the world but in doing so he proved exactly why humanity wasn ready for this kind of responsibility It a cynical ending but also an appropriate one 4 The New Exhibit Martin Balsam play a museum worker who obsessed with his wax figure not unlike Charlie in Miniature While the doll in Miniature are a reflection of Charlie fragile mind the figure in The New Exhibit have a more active role in the story It up to the viewer to decide whether the figure were haunted or if Martin wa just going completely mad but we can all agree that wax figure can be absolutely terrifying This is the only proper horror episode in Season 4 and part of what make the horror work so well is the tension this is the closest The Twilight Zone ha come to equaling Hitchcock mastery of suspense Charles Beaumont wrote six episode this season just one fewer than Serling did and I confident in calling The New Exhibit the best of the six 3 Death Ship Death Ship is a multi layered episode that show you the final puzzle right up front and spends the rest of the episode assembling the piece At this point I contractually obligated to call Jack Klugman the best Twilight Zone actor and naturally he gave u another 10 10 performance but it easy to forget that he not the ONLY good actor in his episode A Passage for Trumpet had John Anderson A Game of Pool had Jonathan Winters and this episode ha Ross Martin giving u a performance that I argue is even better than Klugman if you read any of my list before you know why this is just about the highest praise I could give an actor Not only wa runtime not an issue here the entire hour wa filled with creative way to tell the story and it made the time fly by Captain Ross interfering in Mason dream wa inspired and I love how the ending wa just an abrupt cut back to the beginning This episode is rich with character development this is yet another Klugman episode where loneliness is an aspect of his character and little moment that I sure I pick up on upon rewatching Of all the Twilight Zone episode that I absolutely adore this and Shadow Play are the only two that I wanted to watch again immediately after finishing 2 He Alive At the risk of sounding political Nazis are bad In all seriousness everyone know that Nazis are bad and everyone know that racism prejudice and hate are bad Are Nazis bad is an easy question to answer but how doe hate spread like it did in Nazi Germany is far more complex and that the question He Alive try time answer Peter is a chicken shit wannabe fuehrer whose hate wa born out of a need to blame a scapegoat for his shitty life and with this character Rod pretty much nailed every Proud Boy every incel every modern day neo Nazi all of them It can feel on the nose at time but this isn an episode that needed to be subtle It doesn shy away from comparing modern day hatred to Hitler rhetoric and moment such a the we are the minority speech very well could have been about 2019 and not 1963 Of course the message of this episode would have fallen flat without the outstanding performance by Dennis Hopper who manages to nail every aspect of Peter character Also Rod closing monologue is among his best and it wa the perfect way to cap off an episode that we still need in 2019 1 On Thursday We Leave for Home In Season 3 it wa a tossup between five or six for what the best episode could have been That not the case with Season 4 because On Thursday We Leave for Home completely dwarf it competition Death Ship and He Alive are both great episode and either one of them could have been in the number two slot but neither of them hold a candle to On Thursday We Leave for Home I don think any episode took u on a journey through one character arc quite like this one I didn think I ever love a performance more than Jack Klugman in A Passage For Trumpet but James Whitmore performance a Captain Benteen wa beyond perfect Captain Benteen might be the most complex character in the series thus far gradually changing from gentile shepherd of his flock to psychotic megalomaniac I wa sold on Benteen being a good person for half the episode and I spent the rest of the episode in a state of pure tension because I wa afraid of what he might do and dammit I wa nearly in tear by the ending which I won spoil here because this is definitely an episode you need to experience for yourself This character ha so many layer and Whitmore played him to perfection in every scene The fact that I wa sold hook line and sinker on this character is also a testament to Serling writing and this really is one of his best script ever Serling unique brand of humanism u present in every single line especially in his monologue where he wax poetic about Earth being a complicated yet wonderful mess Speaking of Serling he really seemed to struggle with the hour long format but leave it to him to write the best hour long episode because he Rod Goddamn Serling I don think I exaggerating when I call Season 4 the worst season of the show but On Thursday We Leave for Home isn number one just because it the best of a bad lot Do yourself a favor and watch this episode maybe watch the rest of the top six then throw the rest of Season 4 in the garbage,Every Episode of The Twilight Zone Ranked

32,Arcticx369,TwilightZone,I just finished watching the screening and without giving out too much I must say it wa a great experience I love the ending and it truly wa an emotional rollercoaster Just the excitement when I first hear the Intro The mystery throughout the episode and the ending is just it own beautiful creation I think that the ending documentary could make anyone who know at least the slightest bit of Rod Serling feel emotional and the bigger fan feel it deep in their heart I truly wish that I could somehow forget the episode because I can imagine what it must have been like watching it for the first time in the big theater I really hope that this could spark up a non hate conversation This is the first time I have ever done this and we could all just appreciate what Rod Serlinf ha given u and be grateful for the Twilight Zone,The Twilight Zone 60th Anniversary Screening
33,jeffreydumber,TwilightZone,Nightmare a a Child is one of my favorite episode but going back and rewatching it I wonder why Peter even came back to visit Helen Did he just think I sure hope this woman doesn remember me killing her mother when she wa 10 I better visit her and refresh her memory about it Unless he planned to kill her regardless and just got off on making her remember him I don know I glad he did it made for a 10 10 episode but that my minor nitpick I guess Any other episode that have minor thing like that that you question,Peter Seldon ha to be the dumbest murderer ever

38,13Mac_,TwilightZone,I recently started watching the original Twilight Zone on Netflix I just finished A Passage for Trumpet S1E32 and I am genuinely SHOCKED that an episode had an uplifting ending I kept waiting for the punch to the gut that come in every episode And it just never happened The episode didnt have the greatest acting or dialogue but I genuinely felt for Joey and wa glad that he rediscovered meaning to life I know one of the primary intention of Twilight Zone is to make you uncomfortable and not glad with the outcome of the episode but this one ha definitely been one of my favorite because it did have a gratifying ending I typically thoroughly enjoy the episode that end in a dark messed up way but i wa curious if there are actually other episode that end on a positive note Or wa this a one time thing,Happy Endings

72,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Yonkers Yonkers Yonkers Fan dancer Hahaha Phyllis amp x200B Y know when I browse through the catalog of golden TZ episode to rehash A Most Unusual Camera instantly come to mind It got nasty people arguing a spooky device and a super ironic twist where everyone dy It even got one of those quintessential window death The four hallmark of a classic But this one isn content to be your lighthearted four death romp it vies for a more dramatic angle in a Honeymooners kinda way It pack in more depth than your average 25 minute but will those Serling plush sale reach projected earnings You just have to read and find ou oh who am I kidding Print is dead Television is dead Long live bingeflix Twilight Zone ha been brought to you by Willie Windows too fragile Over my dead body amp x200B After the first couple of minute this episode come off a your paint by number comedy you got some light banter from a couple of grump and the eccentric TV repairman that seems to delight in Joe trash talking a little too much For what little screentime Holloway get he easily the funniest part of the episode Normally you expect the devil character to be a charismatic fast talker like Genie from The Man in the Bottle but the way he delivers it with this breathy southern drawl with the lightest hint of knowing it perfect That look he give into the camera a he close the door and that zinger at the end are highlight that make you wish Phyllis had called him back for some more screentime Didn expect Winnie the Pooh to be hauntin machine and murderin couple but I guess we going with the comic canon And y know there really is some nice early dialogue When Phyllis is ranting off her suspicion and tell Joe don jump out a window the irony meter is broken Plus she make a comment about Cleopatra which is real amusing considering Queen of the Nile wa aired right before this one Things start going south when the TV turn on Joe reacts very seriously to tonight episode of the Twilight Zone to the point of fainting Phyllis is out there riffing about ugly carpet but Joe shook The episode want you to start empathizing with Joe when he been built up a a grouchy slob who casually insult TV repairman I mean if Pooh weren a devil he be well within his right to leave Joe with his battered down boob tube And even after he regains consciousness he immediately accuses Phyllis of plotting a long con with Pooh in cahoot a if she ha camera planted everywhere or something It hard for me to feel bad for this guy who been nothing but cartoonishly antagonistic Am I saying that Joe should be reacting to this in a cartoonish way Well maybe Wouldn it be funny to jump over the usual hurdle of the character being wide eyed and sweaty and have him immediately go on a tirade on Phyllis or angrily try to call up the repairman Why he even tell Phyllis to do it Eh maybe I just groaning for the sake of it Even if this character meant to be a comedic caricature it not terrible for him to act semi realistically it even add depth I just hope there isn some big emotional climax centered around Joe and Phyllis character like they haven been exaggerated curmudgeon this whole time That would be real bad This episode shown it hand the TV guide say Joe gonna kill Phyllis Will the journey be interesting What Joe gonna do to prevent this He give a monologue about how being a cabby is tough and how people are constantly yelling at him and treating him badly No Bad 17 minute in is not the time to start making your protagonist sympathetic especially with how obnoxious he been thus far As much crap a I given this episode it really break my heart because it could been good This wouldn be a bad moment if you toned down the grouchiness and started giving him hint of depth earlier on And a much a I hate to say this if you wanted this to be a dramatic episode then you should cut the TV repairman out Later it revealed that Phyllis only see static on Channel 10 which put forth the idea that Joe may be having a mental breakdown fueled by guilt But uh no he not It because the spooky TV repairman put a hex on the TV which only he can see somehow The presence of Pooh actually strip away nuance and cheapens the drama And the worst part is I get what they wanted to do here Joe is a sad old man with a grueling job so he drowns his sorrow in booze and TV He seen enough sitcom to believe that a heartfelt speech will win the girl heart and fix everything But surprise surprise Phyllis doesn like being cheated on And then the episode make another blunder by having Phyllis act unrealistically cruel during this big dramatic moment Should Phyllis be mad that Joe been cheatin Yes Is she in the right to break up with him Absolutely By the end of it she vindictively turn the TV on to torment a mentally unstable person Before she wa surprisingly nice to him when she thought he wa sick but now that he exposed a a cheater she just gonna straight up torture him He punch a hole through the TV and she just stand there cackling What a complete 180 Is this supposed to be a realistic person How am I supposed to take this seriously And even after all that there would still be something viscerally poignant about someone tormenting a mentally ill person blind to their pain that is of course if Pooh didn come back to remind u that it wa just a magic trick all along What a waste amp x200B You know what really neat about this episode It sprinkle in some commentary that watching violent television can lead to aggressive behavior which is pretty darn prescient for the 60 Through the episode the only real show Joe watch is wrestling You notice that during that violent struggle in the end Joe doe a chair shot at Phyllis implying that this wa a result of watching so much wrestling Phyllis even call him a TV addict It would be real great if we could attribute his violent action to anything other than Pooh magic power Once you write in a devil that curse TVs and grin into the camera thing become inherently goofier That silly old bear destroying my character depth And why did Pooh murder Joe and his wife Because he insulted TV repairman That wa the straw the broke the camel back Jeez And even in a dedicated comedic episode like A Most Unusual Camera the bad event are always a product of the character greed with a clear progression And even if the way they tumble out of the window is contrived the squabble preceding it is in line with all of their character It also help that Woodward didn give an impassioned speech about how he wa an orphan raised by the street While I doubt this episode is generally beloved I doubt many folk would rant about it this much Nothing get my goat like wasted potential I imagine to your average viewer it a forgettable so so episode and that all well and good And in my holy crusade against television I forgot to mention that this episode isn written by a regular but one Martin Goldsmith who also wrote The Encounter another Season 5 funfest starring George Takei Meh maybe by the time I get around to that I have seen Detour and have something more substantive to say about his work in general Now if you excuse me I have an appointment with the nearest window,The Groan Zone What in the Box
73,lawyerforthetrees,TwilightZone,gt So I had a theory that the entire episode wa due to the fact that the mom prevented the ketchup stain on her son shirt the first time she used the camcorder In almost every case we see an escalation by the cop but she rewinds before it get too intense In the one case where she wasn fast enough to hit rewind her son wa shot and the wound wa in the exact spot where the ketchup stain wa http i redd it ya9fkxylf3o31 jpg Every time she go back she inadvertently prevents her son from getting ketchup on his shirt The universe is seeking to right itself and it is using the cop to do so I mean it could have used bird shit or something but I guess a psycho cop work lt,The Twilight Zone 2019 1x03 Replay Theory Spoilers

108,That-Scifi-Nerd,TwilightZone,nan,Favorite episode in the entire series
109,patriotsfan1,TwilightZone,The Seventh is Made Up of Phantoms On Thursday We Leave for Home and Black Leather Jackets are mine I like the first one for the historical aspect of learning a little about the battle of Little Bighorn and Custer last stand Along with the suspense of not knowing where the mysterious sound are coming from on the mountain ridge This episode had a unique mysterious vibe to it and the ending of all three men going back in time to the actual battle and giving their life for the cause wa a nice twist I like On Thursday We Leave for Home because it an interesting display into the struggle of maintaining and giving up power Benteen ha been the guardian and in his mind a Shepard for all of the people under his watch He doesn want to relinquish all of that power and be just a regular guy The ending is sad with him being all alone forever on the asteroid but he is more of a tragic character while Craig from The Little People always wanted to be a tyrant and deserved his fate more Black Leather Jackets play out like those old campy sci fi B movie I like the combination of alien and the small out of the way town atmosphere It so weird and cheesy that it fun to watch The twist is also something that caught me by surprise What are your favorite underrated episode Why do you like them,Less popular episode that you personally enjoy
110,themickeym,TwilightZone,I just wanted to talk about this and how I am so surprised that somebody can make an episode of something that is SO specific and get it made I absolutely love this episode It made my wife uncontrollably cry for about an half an hour after it ended Some backstory is needed My wife is an on camera personality she not huge but she ha fan from thing like Screenjunkies Collider her own work When she started this journey she made the decision to sort of wipe me from her social medium at least the public persona one And I never really understood but I felt it alone for the most part She keep her family life completely separate and a few time had a panic attack when fan would show up at her parent house She would say it felt like someone is trying to carve out a piece of her life and take it And I never seen her fear depicted on screen so vividly To be successful you have to her personable and you have to find that balance in between sharing your life and keeping some for yourself And I love that this is a horror story about that idea It 3 in the morning and I just wanted to rant about it Thanks for reading haha,The Comedian

125,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,IMO Shadowplay is an excellent episode but I can help but imagine it being told from the perspective of someone other than Adam Grant the dreamer If it one of the other character then it seems more like there a quandary over whether to believe Adam Grant As a character say to him he not really in any danger but in a sense all the dream character might be if he get out of his dream loop and start dreaming completely different individual instead of swapping the actor around Or there be the issue of admitting to themselves that Adam Grant is right and they not real Imagine if the reporter wa afraid to look to see if his steak actually had turned into a roast in the oven out of fear it would prove Grant doe know more about the impossible dream logic of their world then they let on Or imagine some of the dream character having just the slightest uncanny feeling that something is off because they all know they someone else Pity they didn try something like that for the 80 remake,Spoiler Shadowplay feel like it focus on the wrong character
126,Can-Abyss,TwilightZone,Been watching for a few year but I cannot remember if there an episode that involves the American Civil War Y all know any good episode,Any TZs involving the civil war

129,BigDickTheYoungGod,TwilightZone,in the episode Elegy the robot kill the three men because he said where there is men there can be no peace or something around that line At least in Not All Men they made it clear that not all men are bad,Why did people get triggered at Not All Men this concept on TZ wasnt new

131,murasyid,TwilightZone,With that said I got some really great idea on what episode they can do for next season Here me out okay 1 Blue Streak An honest cop who ha been in the force for 20 year patrolling the black neighbourhood is suddenly faced with terror a a recently released ACAB themed rap music sends the local black populous into a murderous gangsta frenzy 2 The Deplorables In the near future people who voted for the party who lost are labeled a Deplorables citizen who have lost all their right a human being and are treated like animal 3 The Illegal As a anti border pro illegal immigration individual Walter Walterman refused to report the illegal that had taken up residence a his neighbor Little did he know that the illegal is a drug cartel gangster and ha taken his wife and daughter a sex slave across the border Of course these idea may sound politically charged and over the top but the Twilight Zone series ha always been about pushing the boundary on social issue I don see any problem in adopting any of these idea,Sup guy just got into the new Twilight Zone series and I loving every episode so far can wait for the second season
132,Goodly88,TwilightZone,Does any one know the plot to the last season Found them on youtube but they get cut off right at the end Especially the 2012 episode,Twilight zone radio season 18
133,Tristan_Booth,TwilightZone,I looked through previous discussion and I couldn find anyone asking the question I like to ask First a brief recap A crook Rocky is shot and find himself in a place where he get anything he want and win at every game of chance He assumes this is heaven and that the man assisting him Pip is an angel Eventually he becomes bored and say he doesn belong in heaven that he rather go to the other place Pip then informs him that this IS the other place So this episode is offering a view of one type of hell although previous Reddit poster had suggested that Rocky simply lacked imagination The episode is telling u what heaven is NOT However it never tell u what heaven IS Many people probably think of heaven a getting to do whatever you want If this would eventually become boring what would be better The only answer I can think of is the idea that you could interact with people you had known on earth which Rocky could not presumably because they actually did go to heaven Opinions,A Nice Place to Visit
134,madmike34455,TwilightZone,Just watched Weird City a Youtube Original by Jordan Peele that is basically comedy Black Mirror and I wa amazed at how similar the season finale of the new Twilight Zone and this show are In the Weird City season finale two actress become aware that they are on a television show and end up not being able to escape and the show even ha the classic TZ voice over narration at the end with some cheesy line about everyone being an actor on a show It just seems weird to me that the two show Jordan wa doing had almost the same theme for the season finale especially when meta narrative usually isn too popular Did anybody else watch Weird City or have thought on this,Weird City Episode 6
135,Justin_Uttavictim,TwilightZone,I remember seeing a lot of Twilight Zone on television a a kid I recently started watching some of the classic One of my new favorite is An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge My long running favorite however is definitely The Encounter because I don think I ever felt that much suspense from watching a TV or even a movie before I guess what I getting at is that I want recommendation for episode that might click a my new favorite What episode made you feel the most suspenseful or had the best unpredictable twist,Need a new favorite
136,raffy_the_musen,TwilightZone,Is it worth watching this new version I wa mildly curious but I couldn even get past the remake of Terror I felt it wa bordering on being woke,As a fan of the original
137,pun_de,TwilightZone,I get that maybe the episode wa suggesting how Rod Serling ha ascended and become to guardian of the Twilight Zone story and shepherd people to the Twilight Zone but why not just straight up ask her instead of having to frighten and scare her,Why did blurryman scare the writer

140,laurezinha,TwilightZone,Hello TZ fan New fan here I just started watching the series today and I really enjoyed the first few episode I just had a question about S1E2 I liked the plot of the episode even made me tear up a bit about little Maggie but I wa just wondering about the scene near the end where Lou make his big pitch I can imagine any sort of pitchman making much money in modern America I mean I never once seen anyone give more than a glance to any beggar or seller on the street The way that Death pulled out his wallet with such enthusiasm pushed the plot out of realistic bound for me Am I missing something about the culture of the 60 Were people more receptive to salesman with such an aggressive tactic,Question One for the Angels
141,LightswitchLaughs,TwilightZone,I really need help identifying one of my favorite episode of the og Twilight Zone It wa where several people found themself in a large cylinder like structure that trapped them in After several try we finally figure out that they are just doll on sale in a bin Can somebody please tell me the title season and episode Greatly appreciated thanks,Need help
142,OneTrueBrody,TwilightZone,After watching Season Two and only really loving a handful of episode I wa worried that the show peaked too soon I glad I wa wrong because Season Three of The Twilight Zone is one of the best season of television in the history of the medium That not because every episode wa great though there are very few episode that I actually call bad It also not the best season because it had a lot of episode that I call 10 10 perfect though that is also true This season is perfect because nearly every episode left me saying wow something about what I just watched make me love this show even more Whether an episode wa excellent or mediocre straightforward or weird complex or simple I wa always entertained At a certain point isn that all you need This wa a really hard list to make because so many episode from this season are somebody favorite I didn just rank these based on my subjective feeling I don want to be that guy who say one episode is the best just because it my favorite but everyone taste is different You may think that my least favorite episode should have been number one and you may think that my favorite episode doesn even belong in the top thirty If you think I wa unfair to one episode and ranked another one way too high let me know because the whole point of this list is to get other people opinion Ok enough of that on with the show 37 Four O Clock The worst episode of this season is also the only episode that I consider absolutely pointless A man want to punish the world evil doer by making them two foot tall but it turn out that he the one who get shrunk at the end That it that the whole episode Do you want to watch that for 25 minute I wa able to predict the ending just by reading the episode preview on IMDB That not a bad thing in and of itself the number one episode on this list ha a fairly predictable twist but make up for it by making the rest of the episode a complete masterpiece but nothing about Four O Clock is worth watching I want to punish the world No don you crazy Rinse repeat 36 A Quality of Mercy I understand that this show is a product of it time so I can look past the occasional non PC moment a long a it doesn interfere with the rest of the episode Will Shatner saying he being treated like a retarded child in Nick of Time is my go to example for dated line that can be easily ignored I can get over the yellowface in A Quality of Mercy though I get that yellowface wa an industry standard at the time but having the lead character learn about respecting the enemy doesn work when the actor is in goddamn yellowface Imagine having an episode about racism where the main character is played by a white dude in blackface it actively conflict with the message The ending is also one of the weakest ending in the series Predictable but inevitable is a phrase that describes an ending that wa easy to see coming but wa also the perfect way to end the story The inevitable ending wa for Katell to make the decision not to attack the enemy but what we got instead wa the war ending before Katell could make the call What should have been the natural conclusion to his character arc just leaf me feeling hollow 35 The Gift The Gift might a well be retitled Womp Womp because that the only thing that come to mind whenever I think about the ending Fear of the unknown is a subject that this show usually excels at but the Christ like imagery used for the mysterious stranger wa way too obvious to be compelling The Gift wa also weirdly melodramatic especially with the orphaned child For some reason I compared this episode to Dust because of the melodramatic atmosphere but Dust also ha emotional weight to it scene that just about justifies the melodrama That not the case with The Gift Instead we get an ending where the stranger wa about to cure every disease known to man but wa killed Cue the Price is Right horn next episode 34 The Mirror Magic object episode are rarely good but a story about a dictator being consumed by paranoia could have been excellent The writing wa nothing special and the set design didn immerse me in the world of the episode What really brings The Mirror down is the performance which were incredibly dull There five character and I couldn tell you a single thing about any of them these actor didn make the character pop off the screen at all Overall The Mirror is just dull It feel like everyone involved just phoned it in and that almost never the case with this show 33 Dead Man Shoes If I wa giving episode letter grade the last four would receive Fs Dead Man Shoes would receive a D a passing grade but desperately needing improvement As much a I love the noir aesthetic it worked a lot better in episode like The Four of Us Are Dying The Four of Us Are Dying is actually a great point of comparison because that episode also dealt with identity While that episode explored the concept through a variety of lens this episode ha way too much filler It take nearly 20 minute for the hobo to talk to the mob bos and that easily could have been edited down to ten minute cut the scene with the hobo friend and shorten the apartment scene I still think this episode isn a total failure and that because of the ending The final scene is super intriguing and contextualizes everything that Nathan went through Unfortunately he dy before anything interesting can be done with that revelation and the ambiguous final shot of the other hobo putting on the shoe feel like a tease This episode would have been interesting if we saw a series of hobo putting on the shoe so the titular dead man could seek his revenge I don know if that a good idea for an episode but anything would be more intriguing than the episode we got 32 The Jungle Does The Jungle suck Yes Is it the worst episode of the show like so many people say it is No The episode go way overboard with talking about superstition like I get it this guy think they dumb can we move on Speaking of the main character I hesitant to even call him a character I forgot his name halfway through which make sense because he le of a person and more of a device to move u from scene to scene I don know if the ending wa supposed to be scary or not but it so laughably stupid that I can take it seriously If the episode were intentionally comedic that be fine but the rest of the episode is somewhat serious so the tonal shift at the end is jarring Having said all that the second act is unironically fantastic The tension is palpable a our main character walk home to the ambient sound of the continent he thought he left behind That scene save this otherwise very stupid episode 31 The Little People Remember how I thought most of the episode in Season Two had interesting premise but lame execution That The Little People It a good thing that I take note because I genuinely forgot about this episode it easily the most forgettable of the season This episode tried to invoke The Invaders but The Invaders is an iconic episode because of it creative format rather than it plot The Little People isn creative in it story or it presentation Craig say in the beginning that his goal in life is to be a ruler of the mass and the second he discovers the little people he turn into a megalomaniacal douche This episode could have ended with the little people overthrowing Craig cementing the fact that he not a god but nope he just get killed by giant because irony This experiment in space psychology is undone by Craig over the top performance he too ridiculous to be compelling 30 Person or Persons Unknown This episode sure doe exist The premise is self explanatory a guy wake up and nobody recognizes him What took one sentence for me to describe is broken down and explained for what feel like the entire episode There a long scene in the shrink office where the shrink tell u nothing we wouldn already know from what came before As the conclusion drew nearer I kept thinking don just be a dream don just be a dream don just be a GOD DAMMIT He wake up and people can recognize him but he can recognize anyone else What a twist 29 A Piano in the House IF YOU LEAVE ME I M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY While that is obviously the best line in the history of television this episode is more of a guilty pleasure than something I call good Characters saying what in their mind when they hear a song is the antithesis of show don tell The acting is really weird too The actor are awkwardly stiff whenever they aren the center of attention which make sense because they trying to accentuate the moment when they cut loose so to speak but it can be distracting Having said all that the moment when the character DO cut loose are the best kind of campy That doesn make this episode good but I wa thoroughly entertained 28 The Grave I gonna do something a bit different and talk about the man who wrote The Grave before talking about the episode itself Montgomery Pittman wrote three episode in Season Three before dying in 1962 Like any writer he had his strength and weakness While he wa a master of world building and character development his biggest weakness in my opinion wa writing compelling dialogue spoiler for my top ten I guess That lead me to The Grave my least favorite of his episode The Grave barely ha a plot it just a scary story to tell around a campfire In fact this story is just a Western version of a famous story called The Graveyard Dare It fine enough for a simple horror story but there not enough meat to fill the runtime 2 3 of this episode take place in the bar and the dialogue go on and on and on The episode fade to black to mark the halfway point and when they cut back they STILL in the damn bar That kind of lead me to Pittman other weakness pacing The Grave pacing is absolutely abysmal I all for a slow burn but every scene just drag on to the point where any intriguing element is drowned out by sheer tedium This episode doe have it fan and I guess if I looked past the pacing and the weak dialogue I could appreciate the Western aesthetic and spooky plot Unfortunately I can place this episode above the more well rounded episode from this season 27 The Fugitive In The Fugitive an old man best friend is a young crippled girl Setting aside the stranger danger element this episode doe have some sweet and wholesome moment I can totally believe the friendship between Ben and Jenny it isn weird at all in context especially for 1962 But HOLY FUCK did this episode not age well At one point he cure Jenny of her disability by laying her down on her bed and using a magical device on her making her close her eye a the girl say will it hurt and be careful with her visibly confused aunt right outside the door and if you excuse me I need to take the longest shower in the history of running water It kind of amazing that two men try to kill a little girl and that not the part that aged horribly All joke aside this episode isn ranked low because of how it aged It a fine episode but it get way too sappy at time 26 Cavender is Coming Is this episode funny or ha my brain finally turned to pudding after watching 100 episode In any case I did enjoy this episode quite a bit I didn think I ever see a Twilight Zone episode where two different people throw themselves through window but here we are This episode is a beat for beat remake of Mr Bevis so it get no point for originality but I do enjoy this one a lot more than Mr Bevis For starter Carol Burnett brings Agnes to life with her trademark slapstick charm Also I really liked the decision to put Cavender himself in the spotlight Most guardian angel story only focus on the human so it somewhat unique to put the focus on the actual angel As much a I do enjoy it it still a typical guardian angel story so the plot is about a run of the mill a it get A Passage for Trumpet is exception when it come to these type of story It not groundbreaking but I enjoyed Cavender is Coming more than I had any right to 25 Showdown with Rance McGrew An actor who play a badass on a TV show turn out to be a total pussy once he get beaten up by the character he pretending to be stronger That not a great Twilight Zone premise and it make me wonder what Rod Serling really thought of his actor behind the scene Showdown With Rance McGrew wa written back when Westerns were dominating the box office so it isn the most relevant episode today Imagine if Jordan Peele Twilight Zone skewered a superhero actor like Robert Downey Jr or Hugh Jackman it probably be entertaining a a parody but it definitely be dated in 60 year That being said I did enjoy the episode for what it wa There something about Jesse James taking the piss out of Rance that I found really funny That doesn make it a great episode a concept like this definitely ha a ceiling for how good it can be but I did have a good time watching this 24 Hocus Pocus and Frisby Comedic episode in the first two season almost never worked but for some reason Season Three managed to make light hearted episode that were genuinely enjoyable Submitted for your approval Hocus Pocus and Frisby A bullshit artist named Frisby ha to survive a real life version of one of his tall tale Plenty of Twilight Zone episode were centered around liar and jackass but Frisby is a different kind of liar He not an asshole he just full of tall tale He lie like your grandfather did when he told you the story about how he saved the kid who got lost in the ball pit at the McDonald playpen ok I may be projecting here Point is I kind of love how full of shit he is and I also love how his friend know how full of shit he is but play along anyway Aliens abduct him because they don understand the concept of lie on their home planet classic comedic misunderstanding This episode get a lot of flak for it plot yeah those people are right I do enjoy this episode for what it is but nothing about it story make it a definitive Twilight Zone episode But those creepy alien face now THAT is what this show is all about So is it a great Twilight Zone episode Not really but I enjoy it anyway There a place for light hearted episode that don really raise the bar for quality but are still enjoyable experience 23 The Arrival Rod Serling opening monologue for The Arrival tell u that we get 90 of the puzzle piece and the other 10 is up to u It a check that the rest of the episode can cash After the plane and everyone else in the hangar disappears the investigator get told that oh there wa no plane you thinking of a different investigation What a lame way to end an otherwise captivating mystery All thing considered I do enjoy this episode more than most people The mystery of the missing passenger is mind bending and that scene in the hangar had me on the edge of my seat If this episode were in Season Two I might have put it at in the top 15 because there is a lot to enjoy The ending just didn deliver and that really hurt this episode 22 Still Valley Elegy wa a really bad episode so when I saw that Still Valley wa going to use the frozen in time concept I wa worried In the end I wa pleasantly surprised by how well they incorporated the frozen people into the episode Instead of spending way too much time staring at still people like in Elegy Still Valley only show u the frozen army for a couple of minute before moving on It a good thing they did that because the effect isn that much better than it wa in Elegy but it doesn dominate the episode to a point where I can help but notice every blink or twitch My biggest problem with Elegy wasn the shitty effect it wa the fact that the episode had no stake and no reason to care for anyone or anything in the episode Still Valley fix that by giving the soldier the power to freeze the Union and leaving the decision to use that power up to them In the end they don decide to use that power because that wouldn make them any better than the Damn Yankees It a simple a a story can get but that not a bad thing in and of itself a long a the episode ha a point I may be giving this episode too much credit because it a much better version of an episode I hate but Still Valley is good in it own right 21 The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank A title from our friend Mr Montgomery Pittman who wrote and directed this episode The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank is a better display of Pittman strength a a writer especially when it come to world building Pittman isn content to just have actor put on a southern accent and call it a day he went out of his way to make the audience feel like they were in 1920 America That ha just a much to do with his direction a it doe his writing so I give him credit on both front He created the perfect setting to tell this story which is compelling enough The mysterious stranger gimmick didn work in The Gift but this episode took note from The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street and tapped into the town fear of the unknown Having said that the dialogue is once again the weakest link of Pittman episode Most of the dialogue boil down to something up with Jeff and after a while I kept thinking yes we get it can we move on Too much of this episode is dedicated to reminding u that Jeff is acting weird without actually showing u how Jeff is acting or giving u a reason why we should care if he a demon or not Credit where it due while I don think these character were well written the performance by the actor were excellent enough to draw my attention This episode ha a lot to appreciate but it also ha me wanting more Part of me think the premise wa too ambitious to tell in 25 minute and it a damn shame that Pittman didn get the chance to turn this into a movie or something along those line Also what the hell wa that closing monologue 20 One More Pallbearer One More Pallbearer is a revenge plot gone awry Radin try to extort the people who he belief have wronged him only to learn that they wouldn give him the time of day if he wa the last motherfucker on Earth Radin is the best kind of asshole he confident enough to believe his own bullshit He so petty that it satisfying to see his master plan fall through he one of the few protagonist who I actively want to see fail but that also what make the episode fun to watch The ending get a little too weird I don think it needed to end with Radin having a psychotic breakdown but I still recommend this one 19 Young Man Fancy It take a real boy to know a real stocking I be referencing line for the rest of my life alongside IF YOU LEAVE ME I M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY The actual episode start off slow I understand the decision to make Virginia the central character it through her perspective that we see Alex change from a man who can get over his mother to a literal child Having said that I wanted to spend more time with Alex Walking Distance wa a great episode because we got to understand Martin Sloan and get inside his brain and I don think we got enough of that with Alex I did predict that this Alex would become a child at the end but I always said that a predictable ending is fine a long a it executed well and I be damned if the end of Young Man Fancy isn one of the slickest scene in the show The house gradually turning back the clock and looking exactly how it did 25 year ago wa outstanding 18 I Sing the Body Electric Ray Bradbury wrote the 100th episode of The Twilight Zone meaning I officially reviewed 100 of these what the fuck am I doing with my life Anyway I Sing the Body Electric kind of ha a Disney vibe to it and that not just because of the Mary Poppins elephant in the room this episode predates the movie by a few year but I digress I loved the factory scene it felt like Willy Wonka meet Frankenstein That where the episode peak the rest of it is charming a hell but predictable I do want to give the episode credit for writing child character who serve a more than just prop to move the episode along Anne especially had a good deal of depth to her having to balance the loss of her mother with her feeling towards Grandma This episode is a bit on the sappy side but it get a lot more hate than it deserves 17 Five Characters in Search of an Exit I wa really excited to watch Five Characters in Search of an Exit I love show and movie with a quirky premise so this episode seemed right up my alley After watching the episode I feel underwhelmed Don get me wrong it a good episode but I wouldn call it one of the show best Putting purposeful restriction on an episode can lead to creative writing The Invaders did this by not having any dialogue and this episode placed five character in a gray cylinder for the same reason My problem with this episode is that it spends so much time building towards it twist that everything else that isn related to the twist is underdeveloped As for the twist itself I wa underwhelmed Some episode are worth watching even knowing what the twist is but this is one of those episode where knowing the twist completely ruin the episode so I won spoil it here What I will say is that the twist doesn really enhance the rest of the episode like in Eye of the Beholder or To Serve Man This episode doe have excellent character engaging performance and clever writing so on those merit alone I can see why it a fan favorite I just don know why it considered one of the definitive Twilight Zone episode 16 The Passersby What is it with The Twilight Zone and The Confederacy I don have a problem with it because the two Civil War themed episode we got are good but it weird seeing the Confederacy not be the villain in 2019 I know this show wa written in the 1960 but you get my point In any case that doesn take anything away from The Passersby I wa able to figure out what the road symbolized pretty early on the episode doesn exactly try to hide it This episode ha an outstanding set with a score that set the mood perfectly The scene with the soldier who lost part of his face is one of my favorite of the entire series the visual of the light revealing his face is perfectly The writing and acting are excellent Lavinia is a very underappreciated character in my personal opinion This is a haunting episode about death and loss set during America bloodiest conflict and I don care what anyone say but Abraham Lincoln appearance at the end isn even slightly cheesy 15 Once Upon a Time I can see why people are divided on Once Upon a Time It another comedy episode that can feel out of place in The Twilight Zone especially if you not a fan of slapstick What make this episode stand out is the decision to present the 1890 segment a if it were a silent film I love this show because it can take me back to the 1960 but this episode managed to take me back even further in time Even if you not a fan of silent era comedy you have to give it up for Buster Keaton The man paid tribute to the genre he pioneered and he wasn even wearing pant for half the episode The story doesn really matter it only serf to get u from one gag to another That wasn a problem for me because I thought this episode wa hilarious but if you the humor doesn work for you I can see why that would be an issue 14 The Hunt The Hunt is an episode about a dog and for that alone it could have been Number One In all seriousness I couldn help but fall in love with Rip and the amazingly named Hyder Simpson They have one of the most genuine connection between any two character on this show which is impressive because one of them is a freakin dog Hyder isn a complex character but his conviction are true wherever he go Rip go It that decision that save him from his own personal hell and he rewarded with eternal bliss Heaven is a never ending coon hunt with your best buddy something about that make me smile every time 13 Little Girl Lost That final scene my God I knew that somebody wa going into the fourth dimension at some point but holy shit I did not expect that sequence to be so trippy It the best kind of disorientating you supposed to feel just a lost a Tina Hell the CAMERA turn upside down Obviously technology ha improved since 1962 but honestly that sequence still accomplished more than some modern movie that try to take u into an alternate dimension Ant Man and The Wasp for example I think I gushed enough about that one scene let talk about the rest of the episode Is it just me or wa the father acting not all that great He wasn expressive enough in my opinion Also the writing get a bit too technical at time at a certain point I like we get it this is an episode about science Those are just nitpicks though I love the episode for it brilliantly creative ending 12 A Game of Pool Jack Klugman is still the best actor in the entire series and he at the top of his game in A Game of Pool This is probably the coolest Twilight Zone episode I can see this being a personal favorite of someone like The Fonz or James Dean if you catch my drift There something inherently fascinating about listening to two expert talk about their craft whether it in an interview podcast or anything else A Game of Pool isn an episode about billiards it an episode about what it mean to be the best at what you do even if it something a inherently meaningless a pool Jack Klugman a Jesse Cardiff may steal the show but Jonathan Winters a Fats Brown keep up with him every step of the way The combination of slick dialogue and outstanding acting is enough to make A Game of Pool a must watch for any fan 11 Nothing in the Dark I be honest with you I didn like Nothing in the Dark when I first watched it I constantly updating these list a I go but to give you an idea of how much my opinion ha changed about this episode I originally had it at NUMBER THIRTY ONE I did have my reason for not liking it might a well get those out of the way now No disrespect to Robert Redford but I don think this role wa right for him He didn really disappear into the role until the final scene and believe me I getting there The issue might be with the character and not the actor because this version of Mr Death doesn hold a candle to Murray Hamilton portrayal in One for the Angels I also get mixed signal at time The message seems to be don hide from life because you afraid of dying because death is inevitable anyway but the ending still ha Wanda dying after wasting God know how many year of her life It a touching ending but knowing that she wasted her golden year still bum me out It sad but not cathartic to me With that first impression I wa ready to dismiss Nothing in the Dark and move on with my life Then I decided to look up review of this episode and I didn know that some people consider this one of the best episode of the series if not the best overall So I went ahead and watched it again which wa when I realized that this episode wa loaded with symbolism I not joking when I say that every element of this episode is connected to the theme of death and fear The dilapidated apartment the contractor scene the fact that all of her neighbor have moved away shit even the bar on her bed symbolize her self imprisonment Some of this symbolism wa obvious at first but I didn appreciate it fully until my second viewing Also that final scene Robert Redford may not have been great for the episode a a whole but oh my God did he absolutely nail that ending Any problem I had with this episode vanished with this touching and dare I say beautiful ending I don know if I ever truly love this episode like so many of you do but I really glad that I gave this the rewatch it deserved,Ranking Every Twilight Zone Episode Season Three

146,Drewsko199,TwilightZone,Note Spoilers abound across all era of the Twilight Zone Compared to some other out there anthology show Twilight Zone ha often been considered more balanced and fair when story end particularly with twist Shows like Outer Limits for instance are known to go out of the way to pull the rug under protagonist a a moment of shock and horror surprise for the sake of surprise while Twilight Zone is more known to do twist of more karmic retribution or at least have poignant meaning behind them The mad astronaut who try to claim godhood over minuscule alien get treated to the flipside of the experience a collection of crook undone by a prophetic camera alien who manipulate a far too trusting humanity into surrendering for their recipe or an old man losing a chance to regain youth due to stubborn refusal to believe and consider in kicking a can In the era of Mr Serling direct involvement ending at least tried to have a poetic weight of balance or at least balanced warning over humanity errs That not to say they all feel repeatably just the man with time enough at last for example losing his ability to read for the folly of being happy with the end of humanity in spite of a history of mistreatment Or the boy with infinite power allowed to conjour people to cornfield and jack in the box without consequence or obtrusion Considering Serling wa inspired by losing a friend in WWII when an Allied supply crate landed on top of him sudden cruel twist can and would be reasonable to be sudden cruel and without meaning But with what wa exercise and accomplished in most memorable tale it almost feel like the Twilight Zone is best when it try to keep balance in the final act Over the year newer take on the Twilight Zone err in going against this idea and sometimes bring hero to a downturn with le reasonable or nonexistent justification The 80 revival brought u tale of trying to persuade alien we aren killer when it turn out that exactly what they wanted of u or a young woman trapped a a doll forever because a girl doesn want her babysitter to leave Or how with the movie adapting classic story it wa felt that the senior who found youth with kicking the can wouldn truly be happy and eventually go back to return to their old life a rejection of a positive magic based on an opposite interpretation of the original With this perspective Mr Peele return of u to the Twilight Zone appears to be a mixed approach in delivering karma to the people caught up in the dimension of sound sight and mind The campaign man who allowed a devious wunderkind to take the White House feel can be seen a a tale of you reap what you sow his end an ironic creation of his own in thinking of playing government bureaucracy off a a dramatic challenge of his skill The comedian finding himself with powerfully erasive stand up speech is driven to take himself away out of guilt is more of a tragedy of temptation and warning of power and responsibility The man whose prophetic podcast left him in a nightmare at 30 000 foot is a strange inverse of the original tale cautioning against extreme assumption and disruptive action that create the accident he tried to correct a opposed to when Shatner took matter into his own hand to stop the sabotage of gremlin The understanding of a just ending might even be giving way to Peele seeking to acknowledge that life itself is more injust than Sterling story often were The final ending for the mother whose replay camera broke just after all that she suffered or the refugee of the parallel dimension unable to evade the deporting organization show a lack of justice that serf a a warning of truth outside the Twilight Zone an overt reminder of reality for the viewer It human nature to prefer a happy ending and detest a sad one but the balance of executing them is always in question Any ending can be enjoyable with proper meaning or gravitas applying this is more important than the event of the ending itself Peele most famous excursion in unordinary horror with the film Get Out produced two ending one with the hero overcoming his captor with the help of law enforcement the other where law enforcement turn on him due to racial profiling Both could be considered meaningful and satisfactory but individual preference can and doe stir debate over which would work better For both the Twilight Zone and other realm of fiction ending need to have weight and logic of a sort and not simply be done for a simple reason of happiness realism or twist for the sake of twist Hopefully a the show go on in it current form this pattern continues whether it the sense of karmic morality Serling era utilized or unfair modern realism that Peele era can poetically work into the theme of the story,Just Endings in the Twilight Zone

152,cicibellis4ever,TwilightZone,I noticed a lot of character have name that foreshadow subtle element of the episode plot Their name suggest something meaningful that will happen to them or another character later on The peddler Henry J Fate and his imprinting the fate of both Denton and Grant in the final showdown in the saloon Les Goodman sound like le good man the neighbor who wa suspected of being the alien causing havoc on Maple St Ace Larsen from Prime Mover Ace being suggestive of card or gambling You could argue he committed larceny by cheating at the casino with Jimbo telekinetic power Chester and Paula Diedrich This may be le obvious because their last name isn verbally pronounced died rich Any other word play on name that you can think of,Character name and subtle meaning

154,Shwabble69,TwilightZone,In the final episode of the 2019 reboot for the show it is revealed that all the episode of the reboot and the original series are just TV show in the world of the episode This explains why the episode before were so bad because the main character the episode screenwriter wasn a good writer But this got me thinking Were the episode actually bad and this wa just a way out of them being bad Or were they intentionally made this way so they could have a major mega twist at the end,Was the reboot intentionally bad

193,LochNessMansterLives,TwilightZone,I didn discover my love for the original series until I wa in my late 20 Streaming site have given u access to so much anytime we want I love how simply the original and even the 80 version handled great sci fi story without much violence and basically zero gore I like to get my child involved early and hope they develop a love for sci if but at the same time I don want to start them too early and scar them for life Haha What age were you when you first started watching the original series,When did you first start watching the original episode
194,clarencebrown1990,TwilightZone,Do you think there are overarching theme or potentially storyline or just like pixars a113,What up with Whipple and 1015
195,kagemushablues415,TwilightZone,Just like everyone here I felt the new series wa a bit too on the nose and it wa constantly sacrificing the dreadful fantasy we enjoy for the social commentary it wa blatantly trying to convey It wa hard to connect with the character because the original series used to be an escape into another dimension whereas the new story felt contrived to keep a certain political message lessoj in focus during each episode Blurryman change this opinion for me a I think it a codex to the riddle of how the fuck could a talent like JP could authorize production of such cheese Heck it even somewhat cheaply us Rod Serling a a plot device in an obvious invitation to watch previous episode The B amp W release is another clue not just a commercial move After some thought I realized the campfire story metaphor after the 4th wall break is JP way of telling u hey I had to do it The creator and starry casting are all eager to tell u how they feel about current issue but there wa no way to do it even in a sci fi setting without drawing parallel to real people and real problem JP knew the cheese hard to be served hot and in your face for example the camera work ha been mainly focused on close ups of reaction shot instead of wide shot This is a clever way to save money on set budget but also glued the viewer on the character humanity instead of presenting a difficult logic scenario for the viewer to question To our frustration the character didn always make smart or totally natural decision despite being emotionally relatable Maybe like me you also feel a bit trolled by JP decision to fall back on social horror instead of oddball sci fi but I have to respect the wit behind such a move Think about it the Twilight Zone is a powerful license that ha huge expectation CBS probably agreed to let JP use this license to lure in viewer expecting more of the same an escape from reality but he just showed u modern day people in a twisted setting that emboldened their emotion yet altered their scope of decision making We are meant to say this is nothing but tripe nothing new to see here However if such dramatic social horror is the norm shouldn we be a little scared Scared of ourselves The Comedian is an obvious example but the captain of the space shuttle hit too close to home for me a someone who worked a a manager before To expect good twisted sci fi we were shortchaged but Blurrymen made it clear that this wa perhaps their intention Black Mirror wa a cult Brit show from Brooker that wa picked up by Netflix before it became widely known Twilight Zone is an American classic with generation of follower airing on CBS The creator I feel are using the platform to show u a Twilight Zone dimension where show suck and we can get out of the necessary humanity writing need to be grounded in in turn unable to turn away from our own reality Rant,Blurryman make the whole sesson worth it
196,ashrules901,TwilightZone,I been binging Alfred Hitchcock Presents recently a I always trying to find a new show to watch that capture the vibe that The Twilight Zone gave me since I finished that so long ago I even went through all of Tales From The Crypt over the last little while and now that I moved onto this classic I wanted to sum up what I think of both series in comparison amp x200B AHP seems le interesting in plot than TTZ and more emotion based The cinematography is top of the line obviously but the overall look seems cheaper than TTZ Don get me wrong AHP ha it strength when lined up to TTZ but I yet to find an episode that wow me like many Tales From The Crypt or even Night Visions episode have Luckily the actor are magnificent in both and their performance keep me excited for each episode amp x200B What are you guy thought on these two classic s,The Twilight Zone 1958 Vs Alfred Hitchcock Presents 1955 Just My Thoughts
197,bryanly1995,TwilightZone,With many people saying how political the new show is which I agree and how the old TWZ never wa I got to say I disagree I about 30 episode in and some of them are pretty political for thier time Judgement night people are alike all over and monster on maple Street It seems really political to me Love the show old and new got hundred more to go If you didn like any of Jordan peeles movie get out u I can see why you don like the new TWZ,Well just started watching the og twilight Zone

199,Cataclysm2100,TwilightZone,The new show changed between the pit of man fear and the summit of his knowledge to the pit of one fear and the summit of one knowledge I understand they changed it because man and he excludes 50 of the population But changing it to one show a fundamental misinterpretation of the original message It wasn referring to any individual fear or knowledge rather it meant humanity fear and knowledge It wa a collective noun even if they used man instead of mankind It kind of set the tone for uniting u in our common humanity and that the new show changed it to one a singular noun suggests they missed that important theme They should have changed it to pit of our fear and the summit of our knowledge,Changing the intro spiel show they missed the point

202,splatmynamedawg,TwilightZone,This wa the worst piece of garbage I have ever seen in my entire life I cannot believe how terrible this version of the twilight zone is of all of the god awful version of the twilight zone since the original this is almost the worst this might be the worst that last episode wa 20 minute of a writer walking through a bunch of empty room saying to themselves this isn happening why is this happening this isn happening and that the best the real writer could come up with I mean on a basic fundamental level this is the most narcissistic ignorant worst writing I ever seen in my entire life on television The writer of the show are so full of themselves that they thought we wanted to watch an entire episode about them working This is probably one of the worst episode of television in television history This wa the worst piece of garbage I have ever seen in my entire life I cannot believe how terrible this version of the twilight zone is How dare these people put the name twilight zone onto this garbage This is so far from what the original twilight zone wa All of the political message all of the deep meaning and art that this show try the stuff down my throat every night is the most BuzzFeed worthy Tumblrina pathetic entitled crybaby gobltyguk that I have had to ever be subjected to in my entire life I cannot believe in this 10th episode these buttholes had the nerve to write an episode about how they are not just making campfire story but they are making art virtue signaling like they were trying to get off a deserted island I can even comprehend how they had the nerve to create a CG Rod Sterling what the fuck doe this show think it is Some bastion of holy creativity This this just a circle jerk for these writer that are about a deep and edgy a a 14 year old from 2004 to stroke each others ego Jesus Christ This Jordan Peele guy is a hack I can believe that he put his name on this trash show what a joke The dude only appearance on this episode is walking and talking like it some kind of daytime nock off west wing quality drama from the 1990s How did you not notice how stupid that would look on Camera how after all these episode of your comedy show and directing all these movie and getting all the praise that you get you didn realize that walking and talking isn stupid and pathetic I spit at the people that worked on the show I spit in the general direction of every single asshole that didn request that the credit that they had on these episode wa Alan Smithe,This new season wa the worst twilight zone of them all

206,jrt_01,TwilightZone,How would one write a script for a short film in the vein of a Twilight Zone episode the old one How would one build tension and suspense over say 20 40 minute and result in a surprising payoff twist that no one saw coming all without it seemingly coming out of nowhere Basically how would one write like Rod Serling,How to write an original story in the style of the twilight zone
207,jd_9777,TwilightZone,I only had a couple thing I didn like in the entire thing 1 The Comedian wa too long 2 Nightmare at 30 000 should ended when he realizes who the hijacker is with Frank Sinatra playing 3 The twist in Not All Men 4 Child doctor scene at the end of The Wunderkind What your take on this,Unpopular opinion I loved the reboot almost completely

210,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Let them sit in there tootin on their harp or whatever they do for relaxation Me and youse stay together Just like we wa when we wa traveling down below Hyder amp x200B This episode is so quaint That the word of the day It like an Asher Durand painting It refreshing to see this relaxed woodsy atmosphere in a show that normally find itself entrenched in a concrete jungle When I think of natural setting in the Twilight Zone I often go to the dead canyon of space or the blood soaked jungle of the Pacific theater which are great setting but strike markedly different tone from The Hunt Just watching Hyder and Rip crawling through the forest with frog and cricket chirping sends a smile across my face Even if it not your cup of coke I find that one of the Twilight Zone major strength is how it can tell a whole jambalaya of unique and interesting story There certainly plenty of episode similar to The Hunt that you could draw comparison to and we will but it always have it own distinct southern fried flavor Away bound away cross the wide Twilight Zone amp x200B It shouldn be too surprising that this episode quirk come from the mind of one Earl Hamner Jr oldest of 8 who grew up in rural Virginia during the Great Depression Much of Hyder character seems to draw from Earl Hamner Sr who accidentally shot his own hunting dog and spent day searching for him He wasn much of a church man either spending his Sundays drinking fishing and hunting It also worth mentioning that Hamner already had these old man and old woman character in a series of short story that eventually formed the archetype for Grandpa and Grandma Walton in the hit TV show The Waltons This is but another chapter in the Hamner Cinematic Universe I actually thought it wa really cute how Hyder and Rachel referred to each other a old woman and old man but it work to their advantage a their character already feel developed and we just peeking into their life The opening scene doe a great job at giving u a feel for these character and their lifestyle Really love the set design on the cabin The eponymous hunt is over with pretty quickly I get that most people probably don love this setting a much a I do but darn it can we just watch a man having fun with his dog Also with all the hubbub it easy to forget that Hyder dy trying to save Rip He mentioned earlier that Rip saved his life once showing that that feeling is mutual It often tricky to show a relationship between two character when one of them is mute but I think it portrayed beautifully here Enter gag time Boy am I not fond of gag time Most people are probably aware that Hyder and Rip are dead They are bereft of life pushing up daisy their metabolic process now history We had all the telltale sign the bloody moon the sleepy bird and the lingering shot on the bubbling water with that sad musical sting Also the neighbor tell u Hyder take a comically long amount of time to figure this out and this is where the episode really feel padded This wa originally a 12 minute short on The Kate Smith Hour that seems to be lost medium sans one clip http www youtube com watch v 9TCBemCsQw Given this and some of Hamner comment on Hunnicut performance you can tell that his original vision wa a lot goofier I go back and forth on this one because I like the emotional undercurrent of the episode and I think you could balance out the lighter and darker element but the problem is that it doesn commit to either Once we get into Act 3 we basically forget about all the sadness and get into goofy parable territory Given the type of story Hamner trying to tell it would been better to condense the funeral and dedicate more time to the hunt itself or guiding Hyder towards the gate of hell which he sorta just stumble into Preserving the ending in a more serious story would be tricky maybe have Hyder distraught about dying and turning to his dog for consolation while devil gatekeeper prey on this and when he try to separate them Hyder erupts into a fit of rage in this big emotional climax As it stand the episode is just here and there and doesn manage much comedically or emotionally I think it hit the sentimental beat well enough but there isn really much beyond that It really jarring when the pallbearer carry his coffin in front of his grieving wife and Hyder just standing there clamoring Who in that box I get that he in denial but it just drag and drag I getting Nightmare a a Child vibe But at least that episode know what it want to be Heck even in A Passage for Trumpet Joey concludes that he dead in half the time allowing the episode to flow a lot more smoothly Slow pacing can work with purpose but this is like a jar of molasses with fly stuck inside Ick And in the most jarring of twist this episode come out a a religious parable The Twilight Zone ha always had Christian leaning especially in death centric episode I prefer the Nothing in the Dark approach myself but it understandable given how many Christian household make up the Twilight Zone demographic It pretty solid a far a parable go Hyder love and dedication towards Rip result in Rip saving him from Hell There the weird implication that people without dog are just auto damned but I don really see it that way If there one thing the extended gag time doe it show u how much Hyder care for the people around him He allows the grieving neighbor to dig on his property He ha a loving relationship with his wife and even asks if she find her way to Heaven suggesting that it not just about the dog it about being a good decent person who won sell out loved one for the promise of heavenly reward You can see that Earl loved his father and belief he deserves to be in Heaven despite his lack of faith And finally it time to talk about the portrayal of angel and devil in this episode The gate devil ha a Brooklyn accent and come off a disingenuous whereas the angel a down to earth country boy who don need no fancy wing When Hyder sits down on Eternity Road he mus about how Heaven is mostly full of city folk who disapprove of coon hunting And the episode seems to agree with his thesis Honestly I kind of wish they played this straight What if Heaven actually didn allow dog Wouldn that be so much more poignant and powerful It double a commentary on how you have to conform to some degree when you enter certain institution By sticking to his principle Hyder cast off Heaven in a Lilithian fashion And if you want to keep the happy ending you can have Hyder walk along Eternity Road for a while only stumble into more wayward dog owner saying that they make their own heaven I mean there already some debate on whether dog have soul or not I get Hamner is a good Christian boy who wouldn pen something so blasphemous but I dunno I think that be pretty neat Also it weird to me that dog get into Heaven but raccoon are just there to be hunted Kinda bite don it You could wave this whole paragraph by saying this is just Hyder own personal heaven like Rocky personal Hell from A Nice Place to Visit That a good way to make peace amp x200B The Hunt is a strange entry in the Twilight Zone where Hamner voice shine through The lack of spooky car and spooky piano make it clear that this wasn really written to be a Twilight Zone episode Everybody ha their own idea of what a Twilight Zone episode is and this episode certainly break the mold for me It almost like Act 2 wa purposefully designed to make this episode fit in better which would be totally unnecessary Does this episode venture into Christian broadcasting territory Yeah but at the center lie a sense of love and humanitarianism that undoubtedly belongs in the Twilight Zone,The Groan Zone The Hunt
211,lesterwhite495,TwilightZone,So far the Twilight zone ha had four series done through the year I read a comment here that he wrote an episode and someone said it wa the collection but the writer don mention him So which episode wa it,Did Joss Whedon write an EP for the show

215,nulldrone,TwilightZone,And the man caught her and he choked her Helen remember He choked her Then he picked up something heavy and he hit her on the head Then she fell And then you screamed And the man looked at you The man looked at you Then you screamed so loud Helen You screamed so loud Markie amp x200B Children are creepy The way they slop their booger all over your shirt and delight in stepping on your toe Their fascination with poop and nudity The way they turn on a dime The realization that this wa once you But enough about my Fridays The Twilight Zone manages to make child creepy by making them a un childlike a possible Despite the anecdotal evidence child are still regarded a innocent naive and full of wonder It just plain fun to watch a child grow and learn thing about the world The Twilight Zone spin this on it li l head by giving them dark brooding attribute for some major spooky juxtaposition Anthony Fremont the little dude with all the gnarly power Markie ha a weird disposition and know an awful a lot about Helen Foley even more than Helen herself But every child adult and old man turned into a child are but blastocyst floating around in the petri dish that we have labeled the Twilight Zone amp x200B Helen is weird She isn creeped out at all when this mysterious little girl professes to know everything about her right down to the scar on her skin In fact she invite her in for drink It a little funny that there a sting after Markie exclaims that Helen doesn like marshmallow Oh god how did she know The dramatic sting are way off this episode You could write that off a Helen being overly friendly because she know a lot about child and work with them daily and besides Markie own weirdness overshadows this Helen lack of concern over the disturbing wealth of information Markie ha on her make me think she be an easy target for being stalked There plenty of little hint about Markie identity You don have to be a Wikipedia aficionado to be suspicious that they like their hot chocolate the same way And this might just be hindsight but I swear they have similar facial structure and Markie talk with that same soft cadence that Helen ha And Markie is constantly urging Helen on to realize this Like the double meaning when Markie asks Do people look familiar to you sometimes It kind of baffling that Helen blocked out what she used to look like I wish we got more insight into what Helen daily routine and how her life ha been altered Enter Peter Selden He got those bored baggy eye with a sleazy toothy smile underneath Are these the teeth of a childhood friend But Helen doesn pick up on any of this She kind of doofy and willing to let anybody into her apartment And we a the audience get an impending sense of danger that she sitting alone with a probable murderer in a tiny room and ha this confused defenseless air to her When he reach into his coat pocket and pull out a childhood photo of her and talk about what a beautiful child she wa all the creep alarm are going off He literally said he had a crush on her a a child But she doesn react to this at all She just furrow her brow and ha that same confused stare It nerve wracking About halfway in Selden spell it out Markie wa Helen childhood nickname It weird that Selden going out of his way to jog her memory but I guess he wa planning on murdering her anyway This is a problem with all amnesiac story especially on rewatch it painfully obvious to u what going on but she just stand there with that dumb look on her face Markie is an audience surrogate in this way she constantly urging Helen to remember who she is and this progress throughout the episode Eventually she get fed up and tell Helen everything point blank I love how she describes it in this snappy child way echoing Helen mental process Terry Burnham wa great here What with child actor stealing the show She sort of constrained by being this solemn wise girl but we get cute moment like when she smile and go Really while jogging Helen memory and how she immediately flees when Selden arrives Helen wa frightened when she saw Selden in his car without even recognizing him so there some more memory shenanigan going on Shepperd Strudwick doe alright with his spooky murderer shtick and some of his subtle reaction gauging work well to add tension Unfortunately Janice Rule is stuck being a confused mess most of the episode but I liked her interaction with Markie and how her face convulsed upon finally remembering And we get a surprise cut to Selden because Helen never closed the door Little thing like this make you feel for Helen a somebody with a mental block that make her a helpless a a child Now the way Selden death is choreographed is a little silly Some might argue she shouldn be able to overpower him and the way the scene shot is unintentionally hilarious It like she gently nudge him and he fall down a flight of stair like a slinky And then the doctor and the lieutenant literally go out of their way explain to u what Markie wa meant to represent Come on Rod Give your audience some credit Imagine if at the end of The Hitch Hiker a mortician randomly drive up and said Yep look like that creepy omnipresent guy wa Death all along Guess this wa supposed to represent her inability to accept death or something Jeez This episode ha a real problem with expository dialogue And I get it someone who go through trauma ha that stuff blocked out I didn mind when Markie did it but I wish Selden wa a little le blunt and that doctor lieutenant nonsense should been cut out entirely Not a fan The actual ending is sweet Some people might find it too schmaltzy but given the peril Helen gone through her entire life I think she deserves it This highlight her kind nature remembering her warmness towards child from the beginning And when she compliment the girl with the Talky Tina on how lovely her smile is we see how Helen regains her own smile finally freeing Markie of her solemnitude amp x200B This is one of those rare instance where the supernatural element isn the main source of conflict rather it there to help guide the protagonist through their journey Peter Selden is a realistic murderer outside of his supernatural tendency for exposition which give this episode a dark edge Now Helen can get kind of annoying a we overdose on dramatic irony but ultimately she sympathetic enough to root for This episode ha it share of problem and I think the way it unfolds leaf a lot to be desired But I like what it wa going for and I just plain like Markie a a character I kinda wish we just had a scene of Helen and Markie chilling and comparing burn cream Much like Helen herself it meandering and sometimes frustrating but it ha it heart in the right place Also I liked the composition of Helen memory and how Twinkle Twinkle Little Star wa a mantra of sort to help Helen remember it reminds me of neuron firing off There also a weird thing where they cut between Helen and Markie Selden face and Helen background is blurred disorienting u and getting u to feel for her more I not sure if that wa intentional but interesting if so,The Groan Zone Nightmare a a Child
216,Vincinel14,TwilightZone,Hello Longtime lurker of the subreddit huge fan of the OG Twilight Zone and I just had a theory what if the diner from Replay is the same diner from Nick of Time My theory go all the way back to the event of Nick of Time After those event something occured at the diner causing it do get destroyed Years later the diner wa recreated and had only one of the Nick of Time machine placed into it possibly because it wa the only machine left after the original diner wa destroyed However they investigated the machine after report came in about it power this too is after the event of Nick of Time and were able to make it a simple decoration If this theory is correct this mean that the diner we are in during the event of Replay is a recreation of the original diner from Nick of Time However this is simply a fan theory We may never know if it true but that always common in The Twilight Zone,Nick of Time Replay A fan theory

219,OneTrueBrody,TwilightZone,Have you ever listened to The White Album in it entirety Everyone know classic While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Birthday but the album ha a lot of filler song that are quite frankly shit For every Happiness is a Warm Gun there a Revolution 9 That kind of how I feel about Season 2 There a sharp divide in quality the good episode are great and the bad episode are REALLY bad As I kept watching I couldn figure out why episode were so hit and miss but then I had an epiphany To put it one way the episode at the top of this list went out of their way to capitalize on their premise and create a memorable experience On the other hand you had episode that had interesting setup but couldn stick the landing which can be frustrating knowing what this show is capable of I guess you could say that compared to the first season Season 2 had a lower floor but a much higher ceiling and you find out why in just a moment 29 The Whole Truth This episode end with a joke about Khrushchev being tricked into buying a car that force him to tell the truth and for that it going to hell I sure the ending killed in 1960 but in 2019 it just dated As a whole the episode never go beyond it one note joke but the ending not only make it the worst episode of the season but quite possibly the worst of the series 28 A Thing About Machines A Thing About Machines is somehow more boring than it title A man getting attacked by household appliance shouldn be le interesting than watching your grandfather yell at his flip phone but here we are The only good part of this episode is Rod Serling giving his opening monologue from a TV screen As much a I love Rod he shouldn be the only part of an episode that I can look at and say yeah I did like that 27 The Man in the Bottle This episode ha a tone problem The second wish ha Arthur wish for a million dollar only to have it taxed away which is almost too realistic to be entertaining The third wish turn him into Hitler With his fourth wish everything return to normal and there an oh shuck I guess everything worked out in the end vibe but I sorry can we go back to the part where a man literally became Adolf Hitler That not a twist that a parody of a twist As for the rest of the episode it a story about a genie so it exactly what you expect but I didn expect to see Godwin Law in the Twilight Zone 26 Static Oh boy I finally get to talk about the episode that were shot to tape instead of filmed normally It wa a cost cutting measure that all but ruined the six episode it wa used it and Static is the worst of them all Ever play a game on an old PC where you have to bring the graphic to their lowest setting and even then the framerate still lag That what watching Static is like The story is basically Sixteen Millimeter Shrine but worse which lead me to a tangent a lot of episode this season were nearly identical to one Season 1 and very rarely did they improve on the original There isn nothing to like about Static but the con heavily outweigh any pro here 25 The Mind and the Matter I not saying Rod didn have a sense of humor but he should have stuck to drama What we have here is an episode that try to be fun and light hearted but just isn I do like the twist that most certainly inspired Being John Malkovich but that about it That my problem with Season 2 episode don suck in a unique way that fun to talk about they just suck 24 The Lateness of the Hour Here we have another episode ruined by it experimental filming but that not the only thing going on here I had a really hard time coming up with word to describe how I feel about The Lateness of the Hour but I know I can just say it bad and leave it at that I had to watch this episode twice because I couldn figure out why I should care about Jana The story is really simple but the execution wasn consistent at all Each scene felt like it belonged in a different episode which is weird because there nothing too complex going on here The twist is fine I guess but if I don care about the first 23 minute the last 2 aren going to change much 23 The Trouble With Templeton It Walking Distance but worse There I said all I had to say about this episode Besides the scene where Templeton leaf and all of the ghost stop acting a the light fade which is admittedly really good nothing stand out Nothing else blew me away but nothing particularly sucked either It a neutral a an episode of The Twilight Zone can get 22 The Silence In my first list I said that Mirror Image wa an episode that I didn understand why people liked and Season 2 equivalent is The Silence The premise is honestly really good a man ha to stay silent for a year and the twist ending could have been shockingly effective There really only one flaw with this episode but it a flaw that ruin everything it doesn feel like he stayed silent for a whole year We spend very little time with Tennyson when he alone in his room and the timeline jump ahead month at a time He could have been in there for a week for all we know and that bad news for an episode that need to sell u on his suffering Of all the episode so far this one had the most potential to be good maybe a longer running time would have helped 21 Back There The first half of Back There is really good I love how the philosophy behind the episode is laid out in what is essentially a group of guy shooting the shit over a game of card John Wilkes Booth a a cartoony OTT villain is surprisingly entertaining Peter on the other hand doesn really have a character He about a average a a protagonist can get and I couldn get invested in him As strong a the episode started it just sort of fizzled out in the end What we have here is an episode with a lot of good quality that isn better than the sum of it part There outstanding concept going on but the execution doesn do any of them justice 20 Dust Dust in an episode with a lot of good element The final third in particular wa really well done from the father hopelessly throwing dust at his son to one of Rod Serling best closing monologue I only have one major flaw with the episode but like The Silence it a critical flaw The main character is a convicted child murderer who basically walked away with no punishment The theme of forgiveness is a powerful one but it would have worked so much better if Luis wa wrongly convicted or at least guilty of a much le heinous crime I know that the point of this episode wa to challenge our conception of punishment and I didn exactly want Luis to hang but he not a character where I can say yeah he deserves to walk away with no sentence If you can get past that then you enjoy Dust a lot more than I did 19 The Odyssey of Flight 33 I wanted this to be a lot better than it wa but Flight 33 come nowhere close to reaching it potential It an episode so wrapped up in asking why is this happening without giving u a reason to care And When the Sky Was Opened wa an episode where you didn know why the astronaut were disappearing but the concept and character were so intriguing that you can help but be engaged Flight 33 focused more on having realistic pilot lingo than making the pilot interesting There wa one scene with two of the passenger talking and I think more scene like that would have made me invested in their plight I have no reason to care that the plane is gonna Quantum Leap for all eternity which suck because that concept could have made for a much better episode 18 The Prime Mover Fine concept bad execution I really have nothing more to say about The Prime Mover I hope you noticing a theme here because I could probably say that about all of these episode so far In Season 1 we had episode like Elegy that tried and failed but I feel like a lot of these episode fail to try Was gambling really the best plot they came up with because that boring a hell The message at the end is decent and the opening scene wa really well done but I expect more from this show 17 A Most Unusual Camera Have you ever read the Goosebumps book Say Cheese and Die This episode is essentially that It a fun concept that lead to some interesting scene but the episode doesn really know how to end the story The three lead and the doorman dying wa played for laugh in a way and while this episode isn exactly serious the light hearted tone just feel off 16 Mr Dingle the Strong Comedy and The Twilight Zone are like toothpaste and orange juice most of the time A lot of people actually consider Mr Dingle to be one of the worst episode I actually love it You can expect any amount of seriousness from an episode where the main character is named Dingle and this episode lean in to the absurdity Two headed Martians and midget Venusians take a lot of pleasure in messing with Mr Dingle because of how cookie cutter he is and that so funny to me The humor is not for everyone but nobody can deny Burgess Meredith natural charm He the best part of the episode by a long shot the whole thing probably wouldn have worked without him It not high art but this episode is better than it had any right to be and I wa genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it 15 The Howling Man I actually didn like The Howling Man when I first watched it The pacing feel way too fast and maybe it just me but Ellington performance kind of sucked A lot of the episode is just telling you what happened is happening which is weird in a show that master show don tell What finally sold me on this episode wa how creative it wa The set design the concept and the brilliant costume design make for an enjoyable viewing experience A few entry ago I bashed episode that I didn think tried to be interesting but here I going to applaud The Howling Man for it creativity even though it can be messy at time 14 A Penny for Your Thoughts This episode reminds me a lot of Mr Bevis from Season 1 but this episode isn cheesy a hell I actually thought Hector wa played by the same actor a Mr Bevis at first but I wa wrong Dick York natural charm is the highlight of this episode and his warm presence made this light hearted tale work It doesn reach the height of more iconic episode but I recommend this one if you in the mood for something light 13 Twenty Two There a theory that audience only remember the beginning and end of anything they watch and if that were 100 accurate then Twenty Two would be remembered a one of the best episode The opening scene is terrifying and I didn see the twist coming at all So why isn this higher up Because nothing that happens between those scene matter at all You could edit out the entire episode besides those two scene and have an outstanding 5 minute short film But I can get over the fact that 90 of this episode is meaningless 12 A Hundred Yards Over the Rim Remember The Last Flight This episode is almost exactly like that Having said that this episode worked in way that The Last Flight didn The stake here are more believable and it doe a better job of distinguishing the past from the present It not aesthetically beautiful by any mean but the visual storytelling here is a lot more dynamic than it wa in The Last Flight This episode isn just good in comparison to it predecessor it good on it own merit too but it easier to talk about why it good when you have this context 11 The Rip Van Winkle Caper Much like the last episode The Rip Van Winkle Caper took some note from Season 1 Specifically this episode is almost identical to I Shot an Arrow Into The Air apart from the twist I actually like this ending more than Arrow finding out that what they sacrificed everything for is worthless is one of my favorite way to end an episode That about the only thing that Caper doe better though A lot of what I loved about Arrow is in this episode but the execution of those same element wasn a spectacular Farwell bashing DeCruz with a bar of gold doesn have the same intensity a Corey shooting Donlin through his canteen Caper is still a good episode but I wouldn recommend it over Arrow 10 Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room I been pretty negative so far and I don like talking like that about The Twilight Zone The top ten episode of this season are the one that remind me just how much I love this show starting with Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room Eat your heart out MJ this is what it like to talk to the man in the mirror I don know if calling this a one man show is entirely accurate since Joe Mantell wa pulling double duty but in any case I loved his performance The mirror effect didn age perfectly but I never found it lame or dated This wa such a creative way of visualizing internal conflict and it wa pulled off masterfully 9 King Nine Will Not Return No I didn put King Nine 9th on purpose Much like the pilot of Season 1 King Nine feature a deserted man with no clue of why he in this situation I wouldn say that this is identical to Where Is Everybody but it a different way to tell the same story Bob Cummings wa outstanding a Embry I could feel his loneliness and desperation in every scene This episode took a unique interpretation of survivor guilt but it still relatable to the audience That not easy to do yet King Nine made it work 8 Night of the Meek Christmas Twilight Zone style I gladly put this in my holiday rotation because Rod Serling managed to capture the magic of the season without sacrificing emotion I never love the shot to tape format but Night of the Meek managed to work around it and create an aesthetic that somehow work with the style Art Carney is charming a hell which is fitting because the whole episode is charming a hell It one of the few episode that genuinely put a smile on my face and I can wait to watch it again in December 7 Long Distance Call You could interpret this episode in one of two way you can take it at face value and see it a the grandmother actually communicating from beyond the grave or you can be like me and see it a the griever just hearing what they want to hear We never hear her voice over the phone and that decision wa enough to let my imagination take over Everyone talk about Bill Mumy amazing performance but am I the only one who wa absolutely gutted by the father speech when he belief he talking to his dead mother This is a well acted beautifully written story about loss and I love it 6 Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up Any Rush fan in the house Anyone who heard their song Twilight Zone know the final reveal which is rightfully one of the most iconic image of the series The rest of the episode is a classic whodunnit and while I wish some of the passenger were more involved in the story it still a classic of the genre The final scene is what make this episode famous and I have nothing more to add besides saying that it a good a everyone say it is 5 Nick of Time I didn understand what the title meant until the ending which put everything we saw into a whole new light Realizing just how close Don and Pat came to becoming enslaved by the tyranny of fear and superstition wa mind blowing It the kind of twist that turn an already solid episode into a masterpiece and I really glad I didn know anything about it going in 4 The Invaders This episode left me speechless pun absolutely intended Modern writer love having silent episode a an experiment but I didn expect to see one from 60 year ago Agnes Moorhead carry this episode not through her relatable character but through pure fear and tension Since I can exactly compliment the writing I gonna give a lot of praise to the director who made every scene perfect without dialogue One thing that I missed in Season 2 wa the Space Age atmosphere since a lot of my favorite episode from last season dealt with attitude hope and fear that mankind had at the time The twist at the end of The Invaders is the closest we get to those idea capping off a brilliant episode 3 The Obsolete Man I wa tempted to just have a three way tie for first place instead of having episode in second or third I didn do that however because I feel like that would have been a cop out Having said that The Obsolete Man wa a serious contender for the top spot thanks to Burgess Meredith and Fritz Weaver We saw Fritz in Third From the Sun but he ascended to a whole new level in The Obsolete Man The Chancellor is a performative showman in front of his audience but cold and calculating when he alone with Wordsworth That brings me to Burgess Meredith and this is his best performance of the series so far It a better performance than Time Enough At Last he that damn good These two master of their craft have a long power struggle with both men losing and assuming control throughout the episode The two set serve a their arena and I can decide whether I love the iconic courtroom or the intimate apartment setting more I don even know what to say about the writing I can only describe it a Rod Serling dancing with the English language I read somewhere that Rod wrote 48 of the show first 65 episode which is goddamn insane He showed sign of burnout throughout Season 2 but he wa able to finish the season with a masterpiece of an episode 2 Shadow Play If The Obsolete Man is elegant in it simplicity Shadow Play is a brain bending affair where everything needed to be perfect for the episode to not crash and burn Needless to say it work Philosophy major will love this episode for it reimagining of Plato Cave but the rest of u will have fun trying to put the piece together In the past I critiqued episode for raising too many question but Shadow Play is very deliberate about what the question it want to answer There a line between complex andconfusing and Shadow Play make all of it moving part work I genuinely didn know whether or not he wa dreaming and I still have fun thinking about what real and what isn In order for this episode to work I needed to buy into it premise which wa easy thanks to Dennis Weaver performance a Adam Grant I didn know whether or not to believe the mad bastard but he wa just that engaging This is what happens when a show take a huge risk and commits to it execution and the first thing I wanted to do after finishing Shadow Play wa watch it again It wa almost number one but I think you know what gonna take the top spot 1 Eye of the Beholder You never forget the first time you watch Eye of the Beholder It is by far the best twist in the franchise Since we don see any face for the first 20 minute the episode ha to communicate through dialogue and body language Hiding the face took creative lighting blocking and cinematography and I can forgive the very few moment where a face appears through the shadow because the overall effort wa a technical masterpiece The writing speaks for itself I think my favorite scene wa the state isn God conversation The twist is so mind blowing that you might miss the Leader conformity speech which is hauntingly relevant to this day This episode is outstanding in every element that I could talk about and that why it the best episode of Season 2,Ranking Every Twilight Zone Episode Season Two
220,trover2345325,TwilightZone,This is just a theory but have you read the detail about the season finale of the 2019 twilight zone called Blurryman It tell about two writer played by Seth Rogen and Zazie Beetz who felt a if they are noticed by by a mysterious person who is there one minute and isn there the next minute amp x200B But when I look at the sneak peek of Blurryman episode it ha the narration line in Seth Rogen character computer along with the line She is about to learn from a paper where they resemble the standard twilight zone opening and closing narration line of every episode especially when Zazie Beetz character try to make her friend notice her along with the reference from Time enough at last and the door from the twilight zone opening sequence is now in the episode itself amp x200B I think I believe to quote John Cleese from Monty Python And now for something completely different that the season finale of twilight zone might try something different a it involves Jordan Peele narrator role is involved in this season finale whom the protagonist of the episode must haven nicknamed him Blurryman a Zazie Beetz character must have entered his area when she entered the twilight zone door which explains why her friend doesn see her and how she end up in an apocalyptic landscape Especially that it involves the blurry line between fantasy and reality a the protagonist are frightened if they are real or fiction and that this season finale is likely a loose remake of the original twilight zone first season finale called A World of His Own Where Rod serling narrator role is also involved in this episode at the end amp x200B And thats all I can say about my theory on Blurryman the twilight zone 2019 season finale,Theory about the twilight zone 2019 season finale Blurryman

222,lesterwhite495,TwilightZone,The man who ruined society is an idea I had where it all started with a man wanting a date I think it would work better for a Grindr type of story a they allow account to be blank and others can log in without being another man or other fact that you find on a dating website It would be a guy who went on a dating website and doesn have much luck So he start to share his life interest and hobby Embelling some story to get more notice He get a few like and offer yet everytime he asks for a pic or a meetup it a faliure So he start going to the gym getting a promotion and clothes that are hot He start to get attention in real life not knowing that he ha a stalker who became obessed with him They place monitor and hack his phone At first he wouldn notice anything strange going on until his embellished story start to come back to bite him a those story were their reason they liked him so much How did he ruin society We one day he see a car parked weirdly and leave in a hurry Also get hears tapping on his window and weird note Overhearing these detail they try to make his life more interesting Like he in a movie What ever event you think make him more attractive and apply it Using future techology they broadcast these event and being said across the sky like an echo It becomes somewhat of a game after a while where some do fall in love seeing him a a champion of virtue and others a a Sims like game where they torment him After awhile the truth is lost with others loving him or turning on him with the drop of a hat a the story change or intermix overtime Making him into a myth like character Finally he put in witness protection a it driving him crazy with rapid fan and enemy who never give him a moment peace Sitting in a cabin he spends his day in isolation a he hears the voice everywhere and find out that no one is safe The president can sleep at night society ha grind to a halt a plane crash or vehicle piling up Secret password and code are now written in secret a hacking and piracy become the norm The military cut the power once aday to kill the air pollution and ordinary citizen are tormented by the echo The man can step outside unless he risk someone spitting him and alerting the others or tell him to spot a they would target his voice with microphone after microphone hit his direction His becomes a curse a it all started a him wanting to a relationship Instead he became known a the man who ruined society,The man who ruined society

224,ZachWritesStuff,TwilightZone,Too much of this sub is arguing and whining about the theme in the show claiming it cause a political divide and take a side but what damn show doesn If you decide to watch The Good Doctor or Better Call Saul you watching a show that take a side If you don want to watch the show don I know I don care about how you feel about the episode and how they handled I sure there many more that don either Sorry not sorry,I think we can all just stop being toxic let the creator do what they do and if you don like it don watch
225,thatvhstapeguy,TwilightZone,I have to admit it wa very pleasing I didn have very high expectation I thought it be royally screwed up But it stayed true to the original The cinematography wa excellent the story wa well crafted although I couldn figure out for the longest time how someone would dial their own phone number then I realized you do that when you check your voicemail One thing I absolutely hated wa the background music It didn fit It felt like an anachronism The main title wa OK still inferior to the original but I can see why they would update it The story seems to be about personality change and self improvement As we change our way to become better people our old self fade away And in some way we lose ourselves Overall I found it to be quite decent and a good watch Hopefully the other episode maintain a good standard,Some thought on Shatterday the first episode of the 1985 series Me TV just aired it
226,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,From the scene where the first man fly into a rage after being turned down for sex pretty much to the end every scene where the infected male freak out is a laugh riot I believe it a story where if it were to be creepy at all the male character would have to underplay their rage except in short burst I couldn even get invested in the gender issue because most of the acting is so over the top it became a cartoon right away Even the scene of the guy shoveling meteor into the fountain made me laugh I think this is deliberate but the the scene where one of the two female lead try to go into Beast Mode by holding the meteor made me think they meant for the rest of the episode to be taken at least a little seriously if they needed that bit of comic relief,Spoilers Not All Men is hilariously goofy
227,browncharliebrown,TwilightZone,A lot of people argue the new show is god awful which I disagree with but I can see why people may not like it One thing I disagree with is it ending Episode 1 The show deal with the comedian He era a bunch of people and screw up others life In the end he realizes his mistake and era himself Episode 2 The show ha a man go on a flight He hears about his plane crashing but in the end he cause the crash He realizes his mistake too late He killed Episode 3 The main charecter is hunted by a cop She us her power to rewind time In the end she learns a lesson about focusing on her past In the end her son is killed despite her best effort Episode 4 didn see Episode 5 Steve yuan a president campaign manerger get a kid elected president He realizes how stupid that is but in the end he still punished for his mistake amp x200B This show ha a very niahilisct theme It Even if we try to fix our mistake you never really can Nothing can be done to stop your punishment It very different take on rod serling idea of punishment No one get a happy ending because we never deserve,The new twilight zone subtle message

229,loserlonerlover,TwilightZone,Spoilers obviously What I curious is if blurryman can be seen in the background of all current episode of this season a suggested in the episode It would require going back and combing through each one of them again The question being then is this blurryman actually the spirit of Rod Serling watching over the production of his beloved series All the weird meta fourth wall reveal with Jordan Peele breaking character wa very odd a well a the idea that this might have been a self fulfilling prophecy for a young writer who grew up on so many episode Regardless I thought it wa very interesting and a bold choice to close out the season with I think my personal favorite episode this season is still the Blue Scorpion one because it felt like it could have come out of the original series There have been ups and down like all anthology show but I look forward to seeing it return for season 2 In the meanwhile we have some Black Mirror to chew on when season 5 bow next week,Twilight Zone 2019 Season 1 Finale Blurryman

234,Dark-Angel4ever,TwilightZone,Like the title said what made this whole series really bad and cringy is explained when Peel say something about the social responsibility of an artiste that there is more to art than entertainment Where there need to be a meaning Well since this show is dripping in Woke Culture political identity and so on They try so hard on the meaning that they actually creating force element and predictable outcome and event that the story is horrible They only neutral story wa the spaceship one which wa the only one that i liked every other one had a virtue of high moral preaching of wokeness imbedded with it,My criticism of the new Twilight Zone partially explain in episode 10
235,ShouldStickToLurking,TwilightZone,I beginning to wonder if the original episode started out a the original Seth Rogan episode they began shooting and somewhere during production post production they started reading the show review and decided to do a little writing Peele make a comment about the monologue being a little too on the nose and preachy I doubt they were trying to include preachy heavy handed writing in previous episode just to set up this line and I find it hard to believe that he addressing just the one line they were talking about The writer then begin to explain herself and her responsibility a a writer IMO your only responsibility a an artist is to yourself and if others want to support your art after seeing what you done for yourself so be it But that just an OPINION and I don feel like the character opinion took away from the story at all It made it stronger I feel like there were a couple line like this especially during the chase scene while she meta discussed the episode she wa in I think this wa the writer attempting to explain their logic and if so I believe it wa done softly and very well I also think they threw in the trope filled chase scene complete with twisted ankle cry convincing herself it all just sleep deprivation jump scare etc to address the main character distaste for cheap thriller and to bore the audience by showing them how cheap the thrill could have been For those who don know Blurryman is commonly used a a representation of the faceless mass critic There a chance that Blurryman started out a a ghoul the angry ghost of Serling but ended up being a way to address the angry faceless critic who were coming after the writer Something doesn feel right when imagining the writer sitting around writing a blurry character terrorizing a person mercilessly then just randomly showing their face and holding their hand and calling it their best way to honor Serling Fuck but then again they been building up to it with Blurryman cameo for a whole season so it might just be that thinly written I just felt like all those scene during the chase were made for something else It doesn feel like they wrote all that just to have the blurry character come out of the shadow and say Surprise motherfucker It your idol I just been messing with you because I so well revered a a people person and decided to become a murderous demon to help you out The ending the discussion about closing your eye to the thing you think aren important childish I feel like this wa the staff addressing their lack of monster of the week sci fi and campfire story episode A lot of the comment here seem to think that this wa insulting the viewer and telling them that they SHOULD close their eye to the childish thing and focus on the important stuff the message but I heard the line a the exact opposite I felt like the Serling line were pointing out to the writer that if you close your eye off to the thing that you think aren important you lose the greater meaning of the message and that she shouldn JUST focus on the message or she only seeing half the picture Maybe it me but I felt like the staff heard the response to the show scrambled to do a write I think Peele even poke fun at himself and the need for a last second rewrite in this episode in some meta meta used it a an opportunity to address the audience and have Serling himself explain to the writer what the audience felt then usher her on to Season 2 where she can take those message with her and use it to write episode that don forget about the childish thing that made the original series so well balanced and entertaining I hope God I hope Also not a huge fan of the CGI but they didn TOTALLY butcher it When his head turned the nose mouth looked completely off and they probably could used a few second le on his face so we wouldn notice but the voice actor that played Serling did a great job There wa a part where it sounded like they cut and paste old sound bite with terrible pacing and different inflection on mid sentence word so they could use his original voice in newly written line Not so great But still if anything this episode make me hopeful If I right about the write I incredibly optimistic about Season 2 seeing how well they addressed the audience criticism in this episode Assuming that what they did Otherwise it would be an anticipated defense to writing they weren confident would sell to the audience and an excuse to use the finale to tell the audience why they wrote the series the way they did give themselves a little stroke and smoke before the finale party I hope a staff member can confirm the former before October 15th Next season depends on it,Theory Blurryman ep 10 finale wa written during the series filming
236,frankay39,TwilightZone,I thought I liked Blurryman from the feeling it gave me I felt fear and confusion with the twist and turn and unlike many episode this season I felt like I wa truly transported to the Twilight Zone That being said the ending with CGI Rod Serling felt very problematic to me They used a mock Serling to self congratulate letting everyone know how they were staying true to the original show and giving themselves his blessing from beyond the grave Whether or not you think this show doe justice to the original having fake Rod come out and give a speech about imagination at the end of the episode wa to me a terrible move to make It seems like a decision made to quell criticism and incite nostalgia and I think that a cheap way to try to get more respect Let your work speak for itself and prove to the audience that it deserving of the Twilight Zone title Whatever Rod may have thought of this new iteration none of u will know and for the showrunners who have lot to gain by Rod blessing to artificially give themselves that honor is low amp x200B Let me know what you all thought of this ending,Blurryman A Good Episode or Just Patting Themselves on the Back Spoilers

246,GregorScrungus,TwilightZone,They both crap save for the second one and they explore similar concept The Warrior A depressed man wake up one day to find that a lot of humanity ha been wiped out by bizarre borderline eldritch creature However instead of holing up with the rest of the survivor in a military grade bunker he embarks on a one man rampage to get to said bunker simply because he Wants to do the right thing But with each battle he get more brutal more ruthless and more effective at wholesale obliterating the monster By the end of the story the being are LITERALLY BEGGING him to stop even resurrecting a ton of people and rebuilding entire city with their technology to make up for their Frankly horrific atrocity against humanity But no matter what they do he doesn stop He just keep killing Eventually even with human society rebuilt so there room for hope he stand in the aftermath of a psychotic orgy of violence a he tell people I did it I stopped them Then people start to back away in fear from him We get that classic jingle a he shout at people not to leave him When our instinct are forced into action are we really better than the thing we use them against The next episode Truth We follow a guy who life in a world with monster in it Said monster kill people whenever they feel like it are complete asshole and are just kind of Yeah However everyone treat them normally a if they human being Our protagonist however see the truth and people call him an Oppressor for trying to stop the monster Moral of the story Minorities are bad Always But the real moral of this story come in audience reaction You see what I mean,Here are two episode idea
247,Comedyfish_reddit,TwilightZone,I used to listen to Erik and Kyle break down the writing of Doctor Who They are really clever funny and informed After finishing DW they are now takking about the original Twilight Zone I don even know the episode but still enjoy Worth a listen if you a fan,Anyone listening to The Writers Room podcast
248,colourblocked,TwilightZone,I wa really excited about The Twilight Zone coming back especially with Jordan Peele being involved but god damn ha this incarnation been very disappointing Point of Origin ha to be least favorite episode so far other than Not All Men I don have any issue with the show addressing social political issue but their approach to this feel so forced and shallow I don come away from any of these episode feeling introspective intrigued or truly satisfied by the writing I in my early 20 but I did watch rerun of the original Twilight Zone a a kid and absolutely loved it Almost every episode left me sitting their analyzing and thinking about what I watched It wa one of the great joy of viewing the show and a I got older and rewatched the same episode I enjoyed them even more Also shoutout to mom who would got me into watching the show back in the day It wa her favorite It still better TV than a lot of show out there right now but I can help but feel like CBS drop the ball with this From what it look like Peele isn even that involved He is a producer the narrator and co wrote one episode Nightmare at 30 000 ft but hasn directed any of the episode I don know the inner working of the show so I could be wrong but I feel like if Peele had more control the quality would be so much higher Get Out and Us had real nuance to them and I never felt like the message wa being slammed in my face If the series get renewed I hope they listen to some of the criticism because I still feel like The Twilight Zone ha so much potential Yeah just a bit of a rant Six Degrees of Freedom is probably the only episode I sort of enjoyed One positive thing I say is that the acting ha been really good in all of the episode This show so far ha just been like a Soundcloud rapper version of Black Mirror the AliExpress Black Mirror or like the Black Mirror version of those weird knock off cereal you can buy from Aldi I wanted better man,I am underwhelmed

256,ShouldStickToLurking,TwilightZone,I get product placement but did they just turn the finale into a Grubhub commercial,We made you dinner We used in unison GRUB HUB
257,BioCultClassic,TwilightZone,The original carried message way beyond it time too and I can imagine there wa also people who were upset at how uncomfortable it made them by confronting idea they most likely held My point Get used to it If you uncomfortable reflect on why YOU feel that way,Those who think this 2019 reboot is too PC are akin to those who thought the same when the original began
258,jonknable,TwilightZone,Thoughts on the more le loved episode like The Whole Truth The Mighty Casey and The Arrival,Good or bad
259,ShouldStickToLurking,TwilightZone,gt There wa a village built of crumbling clay and rotting wood and it squatted ugly under a broiling sun like a sick and mangy animal wanting to die This village had a virus shared by it people It wa the germ of squalor of hopelessness of a loss of faith For the faithless the hopeless the misery laden there is time ample time to engage in one of the other pursuit of men They begin to destroy themselves amp x200B Not the best TZ episode but I always loved that opening monologue,Dust

265,nulldrone,TwilightZone,It like seeing people with their their clothes off I never imagined people were like that You know we do thing without thinking about them at all Hector amp x200B Often in these story where a character gain a supernatural power they abuse it lose it and occasionally learn from it The Twilight Zone is smart enough not to get bogged down by one story archetype so it construct a spectrum of character a recipient of these power Sometimes it a nasty couple who instantly turn to gaming a racetrack and sometimes it a poor couple who get carried away The type of character that receives this power and their reaction to it is the crux of the story that support the inevitable twist A more cruel version of this story would have Hector immediately acknowledge his telepathy and use it to manipulate others only to end with everyone being able to read his thought Not to say that story couldn be enjoyable but it would get old pretty fast Those rumor floating around that this show head is up it own zone would be substantiated Hector pride himself on his attention to duty and hasn missed a day of work He work hard but people don think much of him Thus his newfound power serve not to punish him but to assist him on his journey in becoming more assertive Hector B Poole human coin is about to be spit out by a one armed bandit and chucked back into the hectic stock market TZ is up 0 25 amp x200B I be upfront this is a comedic episode Now I know what you thinking a comedic episode In my Twilight Zone But I wanted a mordant look into the human condition Yes the Twilight Zone ha it fair share of comedic episode that have generally been maligned and forgotten by the public I tend to like these comedic episode more than your average person As an anthology series versatility can only benefit the series a a whole even if they produce weaker individual component It easy to think of the Twilight Zone a this monolith of spook twist and sci fi stuff and forget how cheesy whimsical and warm it can be The Twilight Zone wa always a look into the imagination the human spirit that cannot be shackled to a single tone Dick York really shine here I like him better here than in The Purple Testament and I not surprised he settled into a more comedic role Though that line about mind reading is a lot funnier in hindsight I particularly liked the joke about the empty headed rich girl easy joke but Dick really sell it Also the prompt I fired without even having to read Bagby mind There also a fun moment where he press his nose against the glass and quickly wipe it Schlocky but charming Also I tend not to be critical of acting because it not my field but I wasn a fan of Dan Tobin here and Cyril Delevanti wa weirdly melodramatic June Dayton did okay The nature of this concept force long stretch of time with character doing mundane task with blank expression which doesn give them a lot to work with There humor in how the line were recorded separately and dubbed over some unintentional If nothing else it serf to highlight how divorced one mask one outer demeanor and appearance can be from their innermost thought I don like how Serling frame Hector a a human coin The idea of a coin landing on it side causing something supernatural isn the worst idea but it doesn really tie in thematically with anything Apparently in an earlier draft the car accident gave Hector his power so it feel rather arbitrary It not like Hector particularly duplicitous or indecisive in a Harvey Dent esque manner The closest thematic use of the coin duality go with the whole thought behavior dichotomy which isn terribly insightful and is mostly used for joke Also coin bank Great I suppose the one advantage of this impetus is that it impermanent This episode wave over how telepathy is a curse in disguise with a brief bit of dialogue on how Hectors ear are ringing We don exactly know how these power work When Hector is eavesdropping on Mr Smithers he slinks closer a if it easier to hear him Very strange It not a huge deal since this episode focus more on Hector character growth over the supernatural power which wa a good choice overall I might liked it more if there were more jab around the people who funnel into the banking institution maybe we even could had a swell character moment where Hector generously give out a loan to a struggling mother and work extra hard or something to make up for that The first act certainly could been more ergonomic So how about that character arc It pretty decent I guess You get the impression Hector the sort who think the best of people and realizing their true intention spur him to be le forgiving Helen role is somewhat thankless a she basically the guiding light that tell Hector what to do Granted he need someone to confide in though you really have to wonder what their relationship wa like before the episode Despite this Hector at least ha the agency to give Mr Brant the ol water to the face and give Smithers a well earned vacation the conviction already there Also they probably get married at the end like in your standard comedy Penny for your thought nickel for a kiss and all that Later down the line she reveal her own magical power and hijinks will ensue Smithers also serf a a cautionary tale in what spinelessness and passivity can do to someone stuck in a mind numbing job for decade A lot of the dialogue is pretty transparent I a big champion of show don tell but I get that it come with the territory Smithers candidness also work a a counterbalance to how deceptive most everyone is So basically Hector learns about the evil that lurk within the heart of men We get adultery fraud and standard villainy But in the end Hector end up blackmailing Mr Bagby to get a promotion Are we supposed to see Hector action a good and just This is another problem with the way information is conveyed we never really see Hector work hard or demonstrate kindness Helen just tell u this and she crushing on him I think she a little biased Giving everyone else villainous thought and getting u to feel bad for Hector doesn cut it You could read this episode very cynically the society we constructed is rife with corruption and the only way to get ahead is to be equally corrupt This episode presupposes that Hector is a good person and will use his newfound confidence virtuously but that not good enough And even if this were the case would it be justified The Twilight Zone morality is generally warped in a questionably simplistic way if you a good person good thing will happen and vice versa The end often justify the mean The story the Twilight Zone tell are wrapped in allegory and parable so you can choose to take away basic message working hard showing kindness and being confident are virtue I don think this harsh take wa Johnson intention but it just hang there like a thin layer of gum coating a shiny penny Normally I all for darker subtext behind lighthearted episode but this feel like an oversight It doesn ruin the episode or anything just food for penny And I know you probably going wow way to totally nitpick this goofy comedy episode If there one thing that unites the comedic and dramatic episode it the show moral compass Many episode are contingent on it And that worthy of discussion I think This episode also mark the first appearance of the goofy goggles in these review The goofy goggles are a pair of comically oversized glass that show up a few time throughout the series They aren always the exact same prop they spooky like that Hector seems to be near sighted and the glass are mostly used to show his confusion a everybody around him is suddenly an expert ventriloquist They also break after the car accident gaining some sympathy point for Hector A woman near the beginning ha a strange thought If Liz and Eddie split up then Liz can marry Rock and Eddie can marry Tuesday Uh huh What Are we doing Wordplay again amp x200B This is George Clayton Johnson first teleplay for this series No middleman I generally enjoy his writing he give the Twilight Zone a unique energy I feel his greatest strength is latching onto a certain emotion and creating a story that capture it perfectly I suppose in this case that emotion is the humor in the thought behavior dichotomy This is a solid script overall but it somewhat muddled and the pacing and exposition leave something to be desired Granted some of the cynicism is intentional and inherent in a concept like this and it wa wise to take on this concept in a more comedic direction In a way comedic episode can get away with more by appealing to pathos we feel bad for Hector so when he get his promotion and get the girl we left with a sense of catharsis regardless of how we got there Giving Smithers his trip to Bermuda wa sweet And don get me wrong it is pretty funny even if it relies on the lead actor I mean a lot of episode are like that So a a lighter addition to the Twilight Zone it doe exactly what it supposed to do Heads tail it on it side Spin it around and you can see everything clearly Also I posting these review on BlogSpot

Penny for Your Thoughts Review
267,apolter,TwilightZone,I have been enjoying the new series although I admit that it doe have it flaw One thing that I would love to see perhaps in S2 is more variety in setting The original series featured space episode we got one of those futuristic historical WWII military early mankind and so many others Right now I feel like this series is showing a very similar version to our current reality but nothing that too different a of yet How do you feel about this Of course I want the writing to remain the focus of the series but I would enjoy mixing up some of our show setting,Something I would like to see in the new series
268,luemw,TwilightZone,All of it Left and right Please These heavy handed political message getting shoved down my throat is making me sick Take a page from black mirror and just make cool shit,Please stay away from all politics for season 2
269,Jesse_Allen3,TwilightZone,Don understand the hate towards this new series a i am thoroughly enjoying each and every episode My top 3 favourite so far are Nightmare at 30 000 foot Not all men and The Wunderkind 2 of those episode recieved horrible review which I don get Whereas Six degree of freedom which wa one of my least enjoyable episode recieved good review Would like to hear your comment,What with all the hate
270,OneTrueBrody,TwilightZone,I recently took on the Herculean task of ranking every single episode of The Twilight Zone and so far I made it through Season 2 For now my plan is to share my ranking for every season individually and when I finally done I can reveal my overall list with all 156 episode Season 1 is a really strong season There were so many iconic episode that I wa excited to watch for the first time and I found a lot of hidden gem Even the episode I didn think were top 10 material were good and a a whole I think this season set a high bar for the rest of the series Having said that the few episode that I consider bad were REALLY bad and you find out why in just a moment I wanted to make this list a objective a possible so I didn just put my favorite episode at the top just because they my favorite Even then this list is still just my own personal opinion and my idea of a good episode will probably be different than yours In any case I hope you enjoy this list for what it is let me know what you think in the comment 36 The Mighty Casey Well something had to be at the bottom and I actually disappointed with how much this episode sucked I love baseball and I usually love baseball inspired medium but watching this episode felt like watching your favorite team getting blown out by their biggest rival I can forgive the cheesy sound effect for Casey pitch because it still an episode from the 1960 but the idea of a robot needing a heart in order to play baseball is a stretch That same heart causing the robot to lose it competitive drive is actively frustrating There not one element of this episode that I consider good If you want something that feel like the Twilight Zone take on baseball just watch Field of Dreams 35 The Chaser This show is 60 year old and value have changed a lot since then William Shatner saying his girlfriend is treating him like a retarded child in Nick of Time hasn aged well but this is genuinely uncomfortable to watch When I look at Roger all I can see is a creepy incel who date rape a woman and robs her of her humanity I don sympathize with this piece of shit and the twist make me feel horrible for Leela I do like the inclusion of A Daemon get it and if he wa the protagonist then maybe I could get behind this episode The only reason it isn at the bottom is because it actually somewhat well written at least structurally Still this is the only episode that I wanted to turn off halfway through and that unforgivable 34 Elegy Elegy feel more like a parody of The Twilight Zone than an actual episode I don expect special effect from sixty year ago to age perfectly but if the premise relies on our bland and indistinguishable astronaut seeing people frozen in time maybe don include the shot where people are obviously blinking and twitching I don like how the final scene is basically a monologue explaining everything it such a lazy way to deliver information It an incompetent episode but it almost so bad it good That not enough to put it higher on the list but here we are 33 A Nice Place to Visit The idea of your own personal Heaven actually be Hell is interesting but it a premise that is tricky to maintain for a full episode You have to balance the pleasure with the dissatisfaction that come with getting everything you ever wanted and this episode botched the execution It implied that Pip is able to control thing such a the odds of Rocky winning at the casino and the risk of getting caught robbing a bank If you able to ask for condition like this even a semi confident buffoon could make this Hell work for them There wa some fun to be had but that revelation took the sting out of the entire episode 32 The Fever Was this supposed to be scary There a scene where Franklin is talking about the slot machine a if it wa an entity out for his soul and the scene ha an intense air to it Then we see the walking talking slot machine and it just too ridiculous to be scary The rest of the episode is nothing special and Franklin go from being anti gambling to being stark raving mad way too quickly 31 Mirror Image This is the first entry that I think people will disagree with me on because it seems like everybody like this episode except for me The performance receive a lot of praise and it honestly not undeserved Thing is nearly every episode is well acted and the acting in Mirror Image doesn elevate the rest of the episode like Jack Klugman performance in A Passage for Trumpet but I getting ahead of myself Besides the acting I don get the appeal of this episode Doppelgängers are creepy but the story begin and end at a woman see her clone twice The character aren fleshed out enough for me to care about them so I can empathize with Millicent fear or Paul concern The ending is also more confusing than anything ambiguous ending can work really well but this one raise a lot of question that I quite frankly don care to find answer to 30 A World of Difference I really wanted to like A World of Difference partly because it another decently popular episode but mostly because of how much I love The Truman Show This episode just made me want to watch The Truman Show because any good thing I could say about it wa done much better in that movie and many others with a similar premise The body of the episode doesn work for me because Gerry isn developed beyond alcoholic with a bitch wife and the role he loses himself into is barely defined at all credit where it due that last point is actually explored in the episode Also the ending rip off Sixteen Millimeter Shrine 29 Mr Bevis I been negative so far but this is the last episode on the list that I consider bad and even then I don dislike Mr Bevis The problem with this episode is how saccharine it is It feel like how It a Wonderful Life would look if George Bailey wa only mildly annoyed with his life Henry Bevis never wanted to change everything about himself he just had one crummy day that he like to fix At time it a charming love letter to the world goober but too often it feel like the pilot for a show called Leave it to Bevis 28 A World of His Own A writer whose creation come to life is a great idea with a lot of creative direction to go in Unfortunately we only get to see Greg create Mary and an elephant and later destroy his wife The writing is solid enough and I wa never bored watching this episode but it could have gone so much further with it premise I do love Rod cameo at the end it hard to believe that this wa the first time we actually saw his face 27 What You Need By now you probably sensing a theme with my ranking I hate seeing great premise ruined by weak execution What You Need is that concept defined The opening scene with the peddler in the bar is great the middle where Fred try to partner up with him doesn go anywhere and the ending where Pedott say he had to kill Fred because he would have killed him otherwise doesn make any sense If this guy could predict the future why would he give Fred the scissors or the pen in the first place I had so many question coming out of this episode that I felt like I wa being too nitpicky and I hate feeling that way when I talking about a show I otherwise adore 26 Execution Great premise weird execution get it The first act is amazing there very little I would have done differently The second half go completely off the rail with our favorite outlaw going all Encino Man when he venture into modern society The ending wa completely out of place did the burglar need to exist at all As much of a mess a it is this wa actually a really fun episode to watch I just couldn justify putting it any higher on this list It hardly the best episode but it the type of episode that I return to whenever I in the right mood for it 25 Escape Clause I don really care for deal with the devil story because of how predictable they are Escape Clause is about a standard a they come It so standard that I actually having trouble coming up with anything to say about it It competent but not all that creative There are worse episode but at least The Mighty Casey and A Nice Place to Visit gave me something to talk about I don even hate it but I also don like it As Twilight Zone episode go it room temperature tap water 24 Third From the Sun The Twilight Zone ha a knack for social commentary that is still relevant after 60 year Third From the Sun ha lost some of it impact now that we not trying to blow each other to kingdom come but it still an effective episode The episode doe a good job at creating tension and a sense of urgency and the acting wa pretty good What brings the episode down however is the random old man trying to stop our protagonist from escaping I get that the episode needed a villain but it had to be this guy I know nothing about his character and quite frankly I don care enough about him for his inclusion to have any effect on me The message wa probably more effective in 1959 but it pretty good for a time capsule so to speak 23 Mr Denton on Doomsday This is one of those episode that grew on me the more I thought about it I didn like it at first because it doe kind of beat you over the head with it message the night Fate stepped in anyone But I kept thinking about it and the twist is genuinely one of the more heartwarming one I love how giving Denton his life back mean never letting the other kid go down the same road he did It one of the better Western episode of the first two season all thing considered 22 The Last Flight This would have been a great episode if the story wasn entirely delivered through dialogue The story of a pilot traveling through time in order to rectify his cowardice is excellent on it own but I would have rather seen his deed in action rather than hear about them in the past tense I a firm believer of show don tell and this episode tell u a lot more than it show I do enjoy this episode for it story and message but it deserved a better execution 21 Big Tall Wish Let me get something out of the way the scene where Bolie is talking to the promoter is entirely worthless take up way too much screentime and drag the episode down Everything else about The Big Tall Wish is amazing Bolie Jackson is such a great underdog and Henry is the perfect wide eyed child The cinematography when Henry make his wish is so clever yet so simple Bolie telling Henry to stop believing Bolie ving in wish and missing out on his second chance is genuinely heartbreaking It a shame that so much time is dedicated to one meaningless scene because a simple rewrite would have brought this episode into Top 10 territory I just spitballing here but imagine replacing that one scene with a few short scene of Bolie winning fight thanks to Henry wish That would have made the ending that much more powerful 20 The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine We reached the point where I get to start talking about the episode I really love If I wa ranking this solely on how much I liked the episode this would be in the top ten This is one of those episode that might not be a memorable if it wasn for the acting so it a good thing that every actor is at the top of their game especially Ida Lupino a Barbie The Twilight Zone love nostalgia and this episode is a character study of a woman who loses herself to her pursuit of the past After Barbie get chewed out by the director even I started to sympathize with her desire to go back in time I been told that this is really similar to Sunset Boulevard which I haven seen but on it own it definitely an episode worth watching even though I wouldn call it one of the elite episode 19 The Four of Us Are Dying Again this an episode that I enjoy a lot more than my ranking suggests A man who can change his face at will is an awesome concept and the story we got explores that concept really well I love the visual presentation of this episode from the noir aesthetic to the clever way they hide the moment where the actor switch out The only reason it isn higher is because the episode end just a it start getting interesting It one of the few episode that I think would have benefited from Season 4 extended run time I love the episode we got I just wanted more 18 People are Alike All Over Honestly This is a good episode that I don have a lot to say about I take note after finishing each episode and after I watched this one I had a lot of trouble finding anything to write I did enjoy it the twist is awesome and I loved the one line let me know what I dying for but honestly a lot of the episode just felt like filler The only scene I can remember in any sort of detail wa the ending There wa that one Martian woman who feel bad about putting our hero in captivity and if she wa more developed it could have been great It one of those episode I feel like I need to rewatch when I go ahead and make my overall list 17 A Stop at Willoughby I don think there a single fan of the show who dislike this episode myself included It wa actually a personal favorite of Rod Serling himself It a really solid episode that doe so many thing right but it doesn do any one thing better than other Twilight Zone episode Walking Distance is better at romanticizing nostalgia Time Enough at Last ha a better portrayal of a man who want to escape from the world and I could go on but I don want to seem like I piling on this episode because I do really like it James Daly gave a great performance and the final shot is one hell of an ending It a solid 8 in a season that gave u a lot of 9 and 10 which just go to show how strong the competition wa 16 Perchance to Dream Perchance to Dream ha some of the slickest cinematography of the entire season I actually like the aesthetic of the real world a lot more than the dream sequence but the latter scene still look incredible I not the biggest fan of the story but Richard Conte performance allowed me to buy into everything that wa going on It wa all just a dream ending are almost always lame to me but it worked here better than it ha in other show movie I seen 15 One for the Angels Admit it you smiled when Mr Death told Lou you made it The ending is so sweet and iconic that you start to forget just how tight the writing is for the rest of the episode Ed Wynn and Murray Hamilton have outstanding chemistry making Death seem more like a friend than something to be feared It only the second episode which make it even more remarkable considering how well rounded it is 14 The Lonely The Lonely is another episode that could have been perfect with a longer running time but I still love this episode a it is The concept is pure 1950 futurism and the setup before Alicia introduction wa outstanding The final act wa also incredibly well done I could feel Corry connection to Alicia and the dilemma he found himself in I just wish their relationship wa more developed which is exactly why The Lonely deserved a longer runtime or at least made better use of the time it had It wa a great episode that I highly recommend but it wasn a strong a the thirteen episode ahead of it on this list 13 The Hitch Hiker Not gonna lie I enjoyed this episode a lot more when I watched it for the first time a few year ago Is it a great episode Of course it rightfully one of the most iconic episode of the original series Nan performance is outstanding and it an incredibly well told thriller that put modern horror movie to shame It one of the great but is it the best of the best The twist is shocking but to me a great twist should make you reconsider the episode you just watched and see it in a whole new light Besides some clever foreshadowing I missed the first time around you on the side of the angel the knowledge that she already dead doesn really change anything A lot and I mean a LOT of people consider this to be one of the best episode of the entire series but personally I think it just a great episode in a series full of great episode 12 Long Live Walter Jameson The majority of the episode is two men having a conversation and it is a hell of a lot more engaging than that sound The meaning of life and the purpose of death are discussed a one and the same and if that wa the only thing this episode had to offer I still enjoy it Naturally because it The Twilight Zone there more Remember how I gave Elegy a lot of flack for the visuals not aging well Long Live Walter Jameson final scene in which Walter age rapidly in real time is still a mind blowing today a it wa 60 year ago Read up on how they pulled off the effect yourself it something that could have only worked in the day before color TV and CGI 11 The After Hours The Twilight Zone ha a reputation for being a scary show and while it ha many horror element I wouldn call it horror in the traditional sense Having said that the second half of The After Hours is a shining example of what horror should look like Watching Marcia walk through the empty mall in complete silence is one of the tensest scene in the entire show and the shot of all the mannequin stepping out of the shadow is still my favorite visual of the entire series The first act probably isn the most interesting way to set up the second act but the rest of the episode speaks for itself I could talk about the additional little moment that make this episode unique all day but you should really watch this for yourself to get the full experience 10 Nightmare a a Child The most Hitchcockian episode is what kick off our top ten Specifically the tension and pacing of this episode reminds me of Rear Window which is my personal favorite Hitchcock movie Helen and Marky carry the episode really well Helen performance especially is one of the best in the series It one of those episode that you can either take literally see it a a coping mechanism born in Helen mind or really anything you want It one of the scarier episode and in fact it ha one of the most well executed jump scare I ever seen Modern horror movie should take some note from this episode Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ha never been scarier 9 The Purple Testament This episode is quietly brilliant The premise speaks for itself but the episode strength lie in the emotional weight of nearly every scene Moments like Riker leaving photo of his family behind Fitz saying goodbye to Smitty and Fitz silently walking amongst his soldier knowing which of them were going to get it are simply amazing You really get a sense of Fitz burden which of course is a metaphor for the impossible decision that real officer are tasked to make I genuinely want to know how military veteran feel about this episode I love their feedback 8 Where Is Everybody Where is Everybody doe an outstanding job of setting the tone for the rest of the series Earl Holliman wa tasked with carrying 90 of the episode and he take u on a roller coaster of uncertainty The ending is a time capsule of the hope concern and imagination of Americans at the dawn of the Space Age and it even more powerful knowing that we reach the moon just ten year after this episode premiered 7 Judgement Night This is what justice look like in The Twilight Zone The truth behind Lanser situation is revealed in bit and piece allowing the viewer to connect the dot until the final reveal Unlike A Nice Place to Visit this version of hell is a terrifying fate The attack on The Queen of Glasgow is jaw dropping in every sense of the word it among my favorite scene in the series It may seem like I don have a lot to say but it really the type of episode where you can be told too much going into it and I hate to ruin the experience of someone who hasn seen it 6 And When the Sky Was Opened The first men to venture into space weren supposed to come back That a bone chilling premise and the fact that we never find out why the astronaut are disappearing make it even more frightening Their fate is preordained and they are powerless to stop it This episode aired 16 month before Yuri Gagarin became the first man to venture into the final frontier so what we have here is an episode capitalizing on our fear of the unknown Obviously Rod Taylor get a lot of love since he effectively the central character but Jim Hutton and Charles Aidman deserve equal praise This episode will leave you with a lot of question but the fact that it deliberately doesn have many answer is what make it great 5 Time Enough At Last This episode ha a reputation that precedes itself and how could it not The ending the punchline to The Twilight Zone cruelest joke is one of the most legendary in television history Ending aside it still a great episode Burgess Meredith need no introduction his performance is all but unmatched The setting is a desolate wasteland which serf a a metaphor for Bemis loneliness and the set design is an underrated part of the whole experience If you take the ending out you still have a great episode but the ending is what helped this episode remain so iconic after so many year 4 I Shot an Arrow Into the Air Remember Elegy Remember how I said the three astronaut in that episode were completely indistinguishable from each other The three astronaut in I Shot an Arrow Into the Air have their own goal motivation and personality which is really important in an episode where character conflict drive the story In a way the event in this episode don matter a much a the way each character reacts to them and I love that Much like And When the Sky Was Opened the story revolves around the first three men in space what we have here are two story told through the same lens that take radically different direction and I love them both equally I have no doubt that Serling used this episode for inspiration when he wrote Planet of the Apes so if you a fan of that movie you going to love this episode 3 Walking Distance I man enough to admit that I cried during this episode I only 22 but when Martin is telling his younger self to enjoy his youth all I can hear is Rod Serling speaking straight to my soul I watched countless show movie etc about adult wishing they could be kid again but Walking Distance is operating on another level This episode doesn romanticize nostalgia it appreciates it value while also recognizing that pining for your past is no way to spend your present There one scene in particular that best encapsulates this episode and it when Martin try to introduce himself to his parent using his government issued IDs It such an adult way to say that you a child and it almost too brilliant to put into word A real life Martin Sloan would probably have a heart attack knowing how much ice cream soda cost nowadays but the theme of this episode are ageless 2 A Passage For Trumpet All card on the table this wa the hardest episode for me to rank because it my personal favorite Twilight Zone episode I didn want to be that guy who overrated his favorite episode just because of how much I love it I knew that putting it above fan favorite such a Time Enough At Last and The Hitch Hiker would raise eyebrow so I had to be damn sure I knew what I wa doing having it this high Having said all that I genuinely believe that A Passage For Trumpet belongs in the conversation for the best Twilight Zone episode This episode make you feel the full emotional spectrum desperation optimism depression regret hope it all here It not a complex episode story wise but every element wa carefully considered and deliberately executed to achieve perfection Early in the episode we see Joey play his trumpet with what I can only describe a pure passion and that scene add so much emotional weight to his decision to sell his trumpet Moments like that are so easy to perceive but really hard to describe why it work and yet this episode is full of moment like that I can go on without mentioning Jack Klugman whose portrayal of Joey Crown is the single greatest performance of the entire season and maybe even the series With every expression every delivery every upward glance Klugman brought Joey Crown to life I could go on all day about this episode but it the kind of episode you need to see in order to appreciate fully Gene Roddenberry eulogized Rod Serling by saying No one could know Serling or view or read his work without recognizing his deep affection for humanity his sympathetically enthusiastic curiosity about u and his determination to enlarge our horizon by giving u a better understanding of ourselves In my opinion there not one episode that encapsulates that idea better than A Passage For Trumpet 1 The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street As you can probably tell this wa a hard list to write There are 36 episode in the first season An overwhelming majority of them are good plenty are great and a handful are what I consider to be essential viewing I constantly adjusted the order in order to make it a objective a humanly possible but no man is perfect The only thing that wasn in question wa the number one episode because The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street is the one episode that I consider to be genuinely important It is the gold standard of writing timeless social commentary because the theme of this episode are still relevant today By pure coincidence I watched this episode the day before the Mueller Report came out and I genuinely amazed just how much this episode relates to our culture It a brutally honest depiction of how we turn on our fellow man because of fear and prejudice As I wa watching I started to realize just how much I fallen into the trap that this episode wa warning about it one thing for an episode to be technically sound or well acted it another thing for an episode to make me reconsider my perspective It not chilling because some unknown entity will destroy u but because we be the one destroying ourselves and it be fucking easy I didn know he wa my neighbor I have no word,Ranking Every Twilight Zone Episode Season One

287,Nasty1931,TwilightZone,So I know folk are getting all up in arm about the new series I call it new since is definitely not original nor is it lacking in production value Firstly I would grade the entire run for JP PRODUCED 2019 version at a 7 The 3 deduction would only hit for over simplification lazy writing and PC viewing culture trend If you really look back at the OG there are only a handful of insanely classic eps the rest are truly truly some exercise I softballing for CBS sake The 50 and 60 we never going to see any show near what Black Mirror and even the early 2000 reboot tried and sometimes succeeded at doing Having u truly believe we are in the Twighlight Zone A world beyond rationale or reason To compare this new take to anything on Netfllix is an excecise in self doom You pretty much sit and waste time Tring to nitpick and find all flaw in something that is mean to exsist outside of our universe outside of the wall of your experience I used the OG kick the can in a TEDx talk I presented in 2015 to show that current trend lend u to stop enjoying life and continue to grow old and sour about content we want to enjoy We really want to enjoy thing but our mind feel the need to present our critique before we can even have a discourse over digestion and letting the dust settle Black Mirror is a take on tech changing our life and if anything this new series drive home the fact that everyone feel they have a voice Digital opinion are like asshole and we are all ruining our life trying to be a bigger quicker more viral asshole Let just take all thing for what they are and let not make our view become the Twighlight Zone itself,Life long fan A bit of perspective before the hate circlejerk
288,OGkraoen,TwilightZone,The way the episode are shot are very reminiscent of peele work in u and get out but while I don hate the new version It not nearly on par with his other work I looked up on Wikipedia and it turn out he is only credited in writing nightmare at 20 000 foot but when I look at the review of the show they make it seem like Jordan is the mastermind behind the whole show,Is Jordan Peele involved creatively in the 2019 version
289,The-Unburnt,TwilightZone,I think what I realized in these last 9 week is that Serling felt compelled to teach his character a lesson by the end of the episode and we in turn learned from their mistake This version while I still find it oddly enjoyable try too hard to teach the audience a lesson The character are now pawn and are no longer the effected,What this reboot is lacking

292,Poppedopp,TwilightZone,Does anybody even care about a well crafted story and good dialogue anymore I feel like I in a tiny minority that am totally fine with how liberal the new series can be but am really sad how amateurish the writing ha been so far in the two episode I watched What make me even sadder is how most of the complaint here are from people overly triggered by liberalism not the actual writing quality You guy are a bad a the people insisting any TZ critic is a Trump loving right winger It like for both group art can be good or bad because gasp it might have a different political opinion There are great work of entertainment with a liberal perspective It just that based on what I seen of the comedian pacing issue drag along and the airplane one really silly unnecessary ending this isn it,Re the new series Anybody else annoyed by the critic here freaking out sjws AND the fan saying any critic MUST be conservative

299,jrt_01,TwilightZone,This to me is the new show biggest problem Its whole purpose is to wrap up a blatantly loud message about politics in a creepy sci fi package And what bother me the most is that they did this intentionally Jordan Peele two take on the horror genre Get Out and Us Us isnt a blatant but it is there are so involved with race and modern politics that they are actually major part of the theme itself Rod Serling original vision wa to make a show that teach a lesson to the viewer without them really noticing they were being taught until the very end And even then any blatant reference to modern poilitics from that time wa slim to none I imagine there may be a few exception but the point still stand This however is a painful inside out take on the Twilight Zone a subtle sci fi horror wrapped up for u a a blatant political period piece about whats wrong with the world particularly America rather than a subtle message about our society wrapped up a a blatant sci fi horror show,I honestly feel like the lesson learned in the new Twilight Zone are about a subtle a a brick to the face

302,swampdaddy420,TwilightZone,What did everyone think of the episode I thought it wa probably the most violent twilight zone episode ever produced but it honestly worked for this episode The scene with the guard that bullied Deadshot telling his wife to blow out the candle wa so fucking tense and all the scene with the men going apeshit were brutal and a nice change of pace I really feel like this season is building towards an overarching story with the alien fucking with people from earth at this point I also didn mind that there wasn a clasic twist the action made up for all that and I feel like it got the message of consent across Also side note doe anyone know which episode Seth Rogen is in because I swear I saw him in a trailer,The Twilight Zone S1E7 Not All Men Discussion Thread

313,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Martha happy birthday to you Honey blow out the candle But don forget to make a wish Mike amp x200B Like many episode of 20 Twilight Zone I really like the idea this one is playing with I don think any other iteration of the Twilight Zone would have the stone a in red space hulkstones to tell story like this which put 20 Twilight Zone in a unique position This might be a weird comparison but The Fugitive is a pretty silly episode of 60 Twilight Zone where Jenny aunt action could be interpreted a child abuse It relatively understated and put on the backburner for this wacky space king plot and is mostly used to get the audience to empathize with Jenny not unlike Rapunzel cruel upbringing And like The Fugitive Not All Men also ha a weird sense of humor and the predilection of juxtaposing serious issue with something fantastic and absurd I think this episode would been stronger if it played the whole hulkstone epidemic thing a little more seriously because half of the time it want to discus serious social issue and the other time it content with being a popcorn thriller To this episode credit I think it the funniest episode of 20 Twilight Zone yet but it come at the cost of it message which if you ask me is a real shame The Fugitive clearly wasn meant to be this deep dive on the psychological effect of child abuse but both episode suffer from being just too darn silly for their own good While I like this episode better than The Fugitive overall the way that it want to be taken seriously make it more muddled and ultimately wasted potential Almost a wasted a a 15 year old snorting empty shell of hulkstone in a dumpster behind Eddies Eat enough dust and you be cryin out for the Twilight Zone amp x200B The sequence where Dylan play keep away with the hulkstone is really clever because it not only misdirects the audience into thinking there something sinister behind the hulkstone but also get u to question whether it affect both men and woman It also provides a cute awkward moment between the two that build u up for when thing suddenly stop going so well You can see the writer constructing their thesis what could be read a a cute moment between the two could be seen a Dylan being patronizing The way he keep emphasizing that their love is cosmic also support this And y know what I like this twist This whole gotcha there no supernatural element and it wa mankind internal darkness all along turn is one that I can always get behind The thing is it not believable It good to have Dylan a a case study It good to namedrop placebo But am I really supposed to believe that an ordinary meteor shower is gonna get ton of men to become engorged with forehead vein red eye and go full Mad Max Maybe if they downplayed it to a violent bar incident a stalker and Mike get a little too intense The theory that the hulkstones are causing the hulk is just a random flimsy suggestion from Annie anyways maybe if they had a group of woman concluding this or some kind of sciencey news program the subversion would have more impact This episode want to roll around in it violent aggro apocalypse but it can connect back to the present When nerdy bos guy postulate that it a hormonal thing or a chromosomal interaction I just sitting here rolling my eye And I get where they coming from Not all men are angry hyper violent hulk Duh When you hear incident of men committing heinous crime it reflects poorly on all men and each individual ultimately ha a choice in who they want to be While this episode is a little silly if you take it literally it clearly meant to be allegorical albeit indulgent at time This may be one of those oops all metaphor case and I totally get why people would be offended It insulting to imply that men are biologically inclined to be these Saturday Morning hulk that have to suppress this inner bloodlust Whenever I analyze medium I try to give the author the benefit of the doubt so I choose to believe that this isn blatant misandry from the writer part Your guess is a good a mine There a peculiar scene at the beginning that I thought wa really neat So Annie bos tell her that she gonna have to work with Dylan and we cut to this surreal yoga class where Annie is instructed to do a warrior pose This could be seen a Annie trying to put on a brave face but I read it a a greater overarching message about how to respond to sexual harassment one of the opening shot of the episode show The Art of War which carves some neat subtext into the episode The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting when Martha attempt to use the hulkstone to she hulk out it doesn work Victims of sexual abuse won always be able to stop abuser through physical or mental strength alone a that playing to the power dynamic imposed by the abuser While this episode doesn explicitly propose a solution Annie confession to her sister invokes the MeToo movement and the power of reaching out to others and group support That and a goddamned frying pan to the head See what I mean when I say this episode ha tonal problem I also like that it brought up that men can be victim of sexual abuse too and it prevalence among LGBT relationship I wonder if that why the ship named Achilles These are topic that are often overlooked and I glad that they were touched upon here A couple of minor nitpicks Annie wake up in the morning to see that her left arm is bruised If you rewind a little bit you see Dylan wa clutching to her right arm Just an oversight I think Also that brief sequence with the meteoroid zipping around wa peak cheese Not that that a deal breaker I like how the cheese added to the easygoing atmosphere it had going on I probably don need to say this at this point but the directing and cast were spot on a usual Really liked the lighting in this one Taissa Farmiga doe an excellent job at getting the audience to go through what she feeling and I let Ike Barinholtz slice me up like a birthday cake any day Not surprised that scene became promotional trailer fodder amp x200B Not All Men smash two wildly different tone together with mixed result I think it pretty effective at delivering each of those tone like if this episode wa split into two little standard length episode they would be some pretty good episode As a whole it clunky and uneven but I be lying if I said I didn have a fun time overall Again the way the twist wa set up and executed wa half baked and the more I got through the episode the more I figured the ending would probably be unsatisfying Also this is one of their better us of the TV MA rating giving u some gratuitous as violence and an intimately spooky cake scene It want to have it spooky cake and eat it too I haven read any review but I have a feeling this episode gonna get a lot of negative press At least I get to hang onto those unpopular opinion that I love so much Somebody reading this review who didn like the episode might think I being too charitable and even for episode I don like like The Fugitive spoiler I feel it generally more productive a a reviewer to strive for understanding than just trashing on something Trashing on stuff is fun but it just empty calorie at the end of the day It not gonna get you that fiber and HDL Yes we still hung up on the cake thing So the other reason why I haven been pumping out weekly review for 20 Twilight Zone is that I tend to feel pretty lukewarm towards the series a a whole It always hard to write for thing I don have much of an opinion on and I glad that an episode like this exists it not perfect but it got a strong mixed reaction from me And I take a strong mixed reaction over something unmemorable any day Fear before kicker never been sicker,The Groan Zone Not All Men Review
314,Pseudoineffectual,TwilightZone,This may have been mentioned before but I have an unusual interpretation of the ending You know how the protagonist ha a gun to his head and say that he will be forgiven Suicide is a big no no in most religion so killing yourself intentionally supposedly damn you to an eternity in Hell Well I believe that instead of putting the gun down upon seeing the library Henry Bemis actually pulled the trigger his personal Hell wa finally having the time to read but being effectively blind,Time Enough at Last Theory
315,CaptainIronBoobs,TwilightZone,I see this all the time in this sub and it really starting go get under my skin The only episode that been political is Wunderkind Replay and Not All Men are not political episode I black I drive with my wallet and registration on my dashboard every morning because I scared to death that if a cop stop me I might get murdered in cold blood for opening my glove hand compartment or reaching to grab my wallet from my pocket This isn some narrative that been sold to black people by the mainstream medium it behoove you to know that we have friend and family that we talk to This shit isn made up my dad came to America in 1983 he got stopped by the police on the same road in Massachusetts for two year My brother got thrown through the glass part of an oven in college for a noise complaint I will never call the police because I scared to death that if they think I the suspect they can do whatever they want they could be halfway to killing me and if I tried to save MYSELF FROM BEING MURDERED they could say I wa resisting arrest and kill me anyway The terror in public is constant because no matter what I do I always be black If someone who is racist either explicit or implicitly decides to put on a uniform and stop bad guy but his head of a bad guy is wearing my face what can I do about that Could you imagine if in the 1960 people called aboliting the poll tax talking about politics it would sound absurd I not qualified to speak on the episode on toxic masculinity because I not a woman but I imagine the reaction is something similar If a group of people fear for their life because of de jure and de defacto policy then it not politics to them it literally a matter of life and death So I give you some example of political issue negotiating the debt ceiling Departmental bugets appropriation of fund for ice breaker ship for the artic healthcare financing public v private investment in national infrastructure enforcement of national border Do you have any friend that have died to ODing on drug Do you realize how much of an asshole you sound like if you called the opioid epidemic and your friend death political issue I very much enjoy that this show is hitting people over the head with it cause y all still don get it TL DR people fearing for their life isn a political issue If you say it a political issue I will feel like you half of a human being and probably a huge asshole,Stop calling human right issue politics

318,ethan-kozlowski,TwilightZone,When this delted on Wikipedia but when saw on it on monday or wa thursday on this week is Said is based on that short story Which wa made by Joe Dante on master of horror Lot review point it out is kinda similarity The screwfly solution The title refers to the sterile insect technique a technique of eradicating the population of screwflies by the release of large amount of sterilized male that would compete with fertile male thus reducing the native population more with each generation this is done This story concern a similar distortion of human sexuality with disastrous resultat The story begin with an exchange of letter and news clipping between Alan a scientist working on parasite eradication in Colombia and his wife Anne at home in the U S concerning an epidemic of organized murder of woman by men Some scientist suspect a biological cause for this sexually selective insanity selected observation of lab animal indicate that the normal male sexual urge are spiraling out of control resulting in death but the murderer feel it is a natural instinct and have constructed elaborate misogynistic rationalization for it For example a new religious movement is spreading along with the murder the Sons of Adam who believe that woman are evil that the garden wa a paradise before woman were introduced and that God is telling them to get rid of all of the woman When the religion initially arises prior to the organized murder little is done to stop the ideology spread nor are their action of evicting woman from the area the men control prevented Alan realizes that the disease cause male sexual impulse to instead become violent impulse Alan a sensitive kindly man realizes that he himself is succumbing and try to resist the impulse a well a isolate himself from woman While this occurs his wife and teenaged daughter have a number of mother daughter conflict the daughter faithful to her father refuse to believe her mother warning about him She sneak off to visit her father and he murder her killing himself after the horrific realization of his action Anne flees north to Canada since the disease began in the tropical zone and spread outward After most of the world woman are dead adult men start murdering boy In the end Anne pursued by an entire society bent on femicide discovers the source and motivation behind the plague an alien specie is intentionally causing the human race to destroy itself so that the alien can have Earth for themselves And is this a adaption or a Plagiarism,Wait wa not all men a adaptation of the screwfly solution

321,ConspiracyDiciple,TwilightZone,I pay for the CBS app just to watch this show I think the airplane episode wa great I did not like the episode about alien invading Alaska or the first episode I get the point they were trying to make but still just terrible The rest of the episode just seem to trying to make a left political point than actually trying to actually be good I have not given up hope yet but I do expect more than this,Is it good

326,HuffPuff32,TwilightZone,nan,Have you ever had a Twilight Zone esque experience
327,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,The hook is different the structure is different the twist is very different All the title and the hamfisted reference to the original doe is reinforce how much the episode pale in comparison to both the original and George Miller remake Also it a decent episode on it own aside from a few clumsy bit So if the creator weren using the title to put along side the earlier version it would stand much better on it own,Why oh why couldn they have just called the latest Nightmare at 20000 Feet something else
328,thecontinental80,TwilightZone,I keep this short and sweet A mother and her young daughter suffer a terrible car accident in which the daughter pass away As time go by and the mother recovers from her injury she begin to dream about her daughter Every single night even She becomes obsessed with these dream and getting to be with her daughter again She becomes so obsessed that her life spiral out of control a she try to sleep a much a she can only to find her daughter only appears in her dream during the night As it turn out in the original accident the daughter survived and mother is the one that nearly died slipping into a year long coma The mother dream are her daughter coming to visit her in the hospital every night after she put her own daughter to bed,My TZ episode idea
329,gf120581,TwilightZone,I understand that this one is not a well known a some of the episode remembered a the scariest of the show incarnation like Nightmare at 20 000 Feet or The Invaders from the original or The Shadow Man or Nightcrawlers in the 80 revival or so on But a far a concept go this might be the most terrifying because of the cosmic horror aspect Think about the situation that the three main character are in They are disappearing one by one and NO one remembers them not even each other They are completely wiped from existence a if they never existed And there is NOTHING they can do about it Picture yourself in that situation knowing that some unknown all powerful force ha marked you for complete erasure from reality and knowing that you can do absolutely nothing to stop it That cosmic horror worthy of Lovecraft humanity completely at the mercy of unseen unstoppable force that see u a le than nothing It not an easy thing to pull off successfully but Serling did it,And When the Sky Was Opened may well be the most frightening episode in any incarnation of the series
330,TheSuperMarket,TwilightZone,As a huge fan of the original series I can stand this series at all Its not about being left or right I could not care le but it the WAY in which politics are approached in this incarnation In the original twilight zone it always seemed that whatever message the writer were trying to convey they did it with subtlety This incarnation is just so overt in trying to push their view that I really just can do it amp x200B Again I get it racism bad toxic masculinity bad You feel trump bad None of that particularly bother me but can you get those message across without compromising the show amp x200B I feel like the show is one giant infomercial for Jordan Peeles view amp x200B What do you guy think,Does anyone else feel like the new twilight zone is WAYYYY too political politically correct

340,hithere297,TwilightZone,Hey so I just finished watching The Hitchhiker and I got say I disappointed I wanted to like it I really did But it just wasn good and I explain why So the episode start off with a young woman getting her car fixed She driving all alone on the highway and it like we get it Twilight Zone woman can drive They independent now No need to shove this down our throat I managed to get past that though but then we spent like the whole episode watching this woman get followed around by some weird stalker guy who can teleport for some reason Of course the stalker is white but whatever If he just popped up once or twice that would be one thing but the episode get so fucking repetitive by having him pop up like a billion time This episode easily could been cut by at least twenty minute and nothing would been lost As if this weren enough the woman also give a monologue about how she being followed and it like yeah show We know We can see it Didn this show used to be subtle It used to be they could make a point without bashing it all over our head Stop spoon feeding u exposition writer We not idiot we can figure it out on our own The episode end with the woman finding out her mother is in the hospital Turns out her mother had some sort of breakdown after the main woman died in a car crash but that doesn make any sense because we seen her after the car crash and she wa perfectly fine Then she get into the car with the stalker and it like what is this show trying to say The writer seem confused a to what point they trying to make Again I really wanted to like this episode but the writing wa so sloppy and inconsistent that I couldn enjoy it I had such high hope for Rod Sterling but unfortunately he seems to be the victim of his own hype,Reviewing The Hitchhiker 1960 a if I were a redditor reviewing the reboot

342,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,I like how the episode played with the idea of individual insanity v collective insanity Peele narration wa a great little starter here Insanity it seems according to the writer is a battle between the individual perspective of reality and the shared perspective of the group with objective reality lagging somewhere behind Pearson touch on this concept of personalized reality when discussing the song preference The group dismisses this quickly despite it accuracy Similarly Pearson hypothesis that they being watched support his claim and the group quickly dismisses it despite it accuracy Was Pearson insane Objectively not to the collective he wa to himself he wasn Who get to own and give the label the collective or the individual Is the crew insane They believe they are on Mars but the Narrator say they shouldn believe their own eye Is the group consciousness more valuable than the objective reality The objective truth almost take a backseat to our own perception in the short term until it doesn haha The objective truth wa slightly different than his hypothesis but that almost didn matter in the moment which ultimately shaped the group dynamic and decision making While the objective truth will eventually catch up with u the invasion the way we treat each other and our inability to listen to each other can also result in our own undoing North Korea US conflict Pearson Crew As an aside I particularly liked the idea of how human nearly destroyed themselves on a planet sent a ship and leading a few human to survive then the human nearly destroyed themselves on the ship but then find a planet and leading a few human to survive The ol TZ switcharoo This is just my interpretation over the past few week I seen some really intelligent analysis so feel free add your own two cent or build on something here,SPOILERS Sharing some thought on different theme I saw in episode 6 come in and share the one you noticed

344,no1knowsthehalfofit,TwilightZone,This episode will always be one of my favorite The whole episode gradually building up to that ending is so good I still remember watching it for the first time and loving that twist I honestly didn see it coming at all I feel like it criminally underrated and should be considered a classic amongst some of the other episode we see a culturally iconic Also ha a great lesson about the selfishness of that character and the shocking event that resulted from it I mean imagine trying to recover from that mentally you never will killing and showing no compassion for your fellow men only to discover you haven even left the U S It Brilliant,I Shot An Arrow Into The Air

352,FoxDieEeE,TwilightZone,False Twilight Zone is about portraying a timeless moral allegory in it story It wasnt dated by creating an episode about MeToo or Mike Brown or something like that there wa an underlying theme of a greater message The reason that the Twilight Zone reboot fails to measure up is because this type of television isnt allowed to exist anymore television ha to be written for mass appeal and be topical Most writer who could create a brilliant reimagining of the show will never work on the tv industry Its clear that the new show isnt aiming for something like that Its aiming to get tweet made about it They arent hiring classically trained actor like the original the vast majority of the cast are comedic actor,But Twilight Zone wa always about hard political issue
353,Kidlike101,TwilightZone,While it ha a somewhat similar message to the episode eye of the beholder I feel like this episode is often over looked I really liked this episode when I saw it a a kid in the 80 but a time moved on and social medium took over in the late 2000s it seemed to be turning into a reality Half my relative had plastic surgery to correct something and now look like generic face 64 and body 13 off the rack If a certain someone wear a bag or a pair of shoe then post the image everyone want that same item It like they turning themselves into duplicate I often get strange look because I like being weird and would avoid trend Also because I fine with my flaw so please stop shoving those cosmetic surgery pamphlet under my nose and yes it happen often because the location I live in ha over 30 cosmetic surgery clinic Which underrated episode do you identify with the most One that you feel is relevant to you personally,Number 12 Looks Just Like You

359,SanSchan,TwilightZone,Hey guy I going to write a thesis for a seminar on horror and mystery television and would like to write about the Twilight Zone Since the franchise ha been around for quite a while I thought it be interesting to write about how it ha reflected anxiety and trend of the time This can probably be examined and shown best with material that got remade internally so to speak So I looking for episode that got remake in later incarnation of the show I haven watched every episode yet so I looked for a list online but found little Because everything involving Twilight Zone and remake mainly brings up review of the 2019 series at the moment I found one list on imdb but that only includes remake of episode of the original series I like to have an overview of everything a in episode that are originally from the 85 or 03 series and got remade later a well and watch the original and remake before deciding on a couple of episode to focus on I tried searching for info on this already without much luck since every search query including Twilight Zone and Remake mainly brings up review of the 2019 series This is the list I found http www imdb com list ls059807306 http www imdb com list ls059807306 Additionally I know of A kind of a Stopwatch 59 S05E03 remade a A little Peace and Quiet 85 S01E02 Nightmare at 20 000 foot 59 S05E02 and TZ The Movie remade a Nightmare at 30 000 foot 19 S01E02 Rewind 03 S01E27 remade a Replay 19 S01E03 The 2003 episode It still a good life 03 S01E30 while not a remake is also on my radar amp x200B Am I missing anything I also interested in material that wa remade by a different TV series but only if the cultural difference between the original and the remake is really really interesting Otherwise I have to watch every TZ parody ever and that might take until the sun explodes,Twilight Zone Episodes that got remake in later incarnation
360,PlasmaVents,TwilightZone,Your aim is to destroy a much infrastructure a possible and injure but not kill a many people a possible Not leave infrastructure intact and kill a many people a possible The dude in this episode state that the goal is the exact opposite Probably just so they can have the calling the family thing for style over substance Also 3200 calorie a day to sit around and do nothing,In a real nuclear war latest episode
361,trover2345325,TwilightZone,Just an opinion If the twilight zone 2019 reboot series is popular enough when it attracts audience in this current season or season 2 Do you think both the original and the reboot will be used a a scare zone attraction in this year or next year Universal studio Halloween horror night Think about it If the twilight zone is used a a scare zone attraction in Universal studio Halloween horror night It would have guest enter through the white door from the twilight zone opening sequence They will first encounter element from the twilight zone opening sequence and then maybe they will encounter some scare element from the original series like the Jack in the box part from the Its a good life the ventriloquist dummy from the dummy the riot part form the monster are due on maple street The two alien from Will the real martian please stand up The gremlin part from Nightmare on 20 000 foot and maybe some part from the reboot episode like maybe the mysterious A Traveler from the episode A traveler And also have Jordan Peele voice who appears from the beginning and end of the scare zone when he give you advice and guidance on how you can walk in to the twilight zone And that is what happens if the twilight zone the 1959 and 2019 version is used a a scare zone for Universal studio Halloween horror night What do you think,What happens if the twilight zone the 1959 and 2019 version is used a a scare zone for Universal studio Halloween horror night
362,Violinman757,TwilightZone,I have a prediction for the season finale or a cool concept Every episode ha featured the company Whipple somehow It wa the MP3 player camera space suit news Whipple is a corporation that ha a strong hold on virtually everything in the twilight zone The ending of season one will center around the brain center at Whipple I think it would be a greet concept where someone try to take down the Whipple corporation by walking into Whipple Headquarters,Prediction Season Finale
363,Nest-egg,TwilightZone,I amazed at how bad they are so far Just terrible Long and boring predictable and just straight out poorly written I can believe people like this As a true fan of the original show I honestly think Serling would not like this if he were alive And they took one of the greatest episode and remade it and made it stupid and boring they really should have just called it something else because it wa nothing like the original other than it take place on a plane I know I going to get ripped for this just expressing an opinion,I sorry folk these new TZ episode are awful

374,tcr447,TwilightZone,Title question It look like he had a story by credit on A Traveler Does anyone know if Jordan Peele wrote any of the six remaining episode A quick Google doesn shed much light,Has there been confirmation that Peele wrote any of the new season

376,streichers11,TwilightZone,For starter a a 20 something who watched the original series too I love this series for what it is a imagining tribute series That being said why do the screen go wonky and the cabin light flicker when Joe enters the cockpit Like he knocked the pilot out but that doesn effect everything else I sure they did it for dramatic effect I just laugh every time I watch that scene,Nightmare at 30 000 Feet Observation
377,StarChild413,TwilightZone,I a TV writer trying to get something actually picked up so I thought an anthology show like this would be a good place to get my foot in the door I even have a couple episode script already written and I give a sample synopsis of one including it working title but not including any character name or the twist to give you an idea of the kind of episode to expect Echo Chamber First contact happens for a surprising reason the alien who make contact through picking up on Earth radio is a huge fan of an Earth pop princess who wouldn be played by any existing pop star a I don want to make a statement about their fandom and want to meet her in person The first meeting go well enough but then he start showing up at a lot of her other concert event and then people begin to notice a mysterious epidemic of deafness following in his wake whose victim are quickly determined to be linked by their public criticism of the singer music It turn out the alien ha deliberately been deafening non fan with some advanced gadget because on his home planet a soon a you express dislike of something you forbidden from being exposed to it anymore the twist is how the singer and some of her fan get revenge on this asshole alien exclusionist before the only hearing people left in America are she and her fan,Would they accept spec script
378,thelanehayslip,TwilightZone,Hey guy I writing my first original script in the Twilight Zone realm would anyone be willing to read it or doe anyone have one they like to share,Script
379,stolenmerch,TwilightZone,I enjoyed the new series fine and think they doing a fine job The 75 on Rotten Tomatoes seems about right to me so far But I had this nagging feeling that the tone is off It doesn quite feel like we in the Twilight Zone yet and I think I know what it is The show so far is much too grounded in the real world The original show even in the first few episode set up a surreal almost expressionistic pocket dimension for each episode The new series thus far just kinda establishes a pretty realistic world with a single MacGuffin plot device that twist it somehow and this feel a little unsatisfying to me The original series did that too but more often than not it wa a different level of reality being explored I am committed to watch at least season one but I love to see different angle explored other than the riff on current event I know everyone insists the original wa very political and rooted in current event of the 60 but it wa MUCH more stylized than that I think the new series run the risk of being super dated in even 5 or 10 year while the original hold up because it abstract the politics into more universal theme In short I think the new series need to get more weird and explore more timeless theme to make it truly great,The new series doesn feel surreal enough yet
380,Asarian,TwilightZone,I trying to describe high frame rate to my fiance and I recall a shift in the Twilight Zone occurring where the budget wa decreased but from my point of view the quality increased I recall there being a blond actress in the episode I noted the difference at the time and looked it up There wa something about how the shift from high budget to soap opera budget required a shift in camera I tend to compare this to the shift from SD and 24Hz to 1080P and 60Hz I so appreciate any help with showing her the difference episode to episode,Smoothness and the Soap Opera Effect
381,jdm199028,TwilightZone,Can anybody provide link to the new eps Thanks in advance,New season eps
382,JohnGrubber,TwilightZone,It dull the story lack interesting surprise and twist the message are beat you over the head subtle but really not that memorable I guess I had hoped for something where a character might learn a lesson and apply it In these they just get their comeuppance in various way and that it roll credit I also am not a big JP fan though I think his movie have been overrated I guess I am not sure what I want Campy Tales from the Crypt Sci Fi Outer Limits All I know is that The comedian wa a weak pilot and the other haven been any better,I really want to like the new TZ but

385,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,I realize this is an unpopular opinion but current politics aside I thought it wa a well done characterization of the factor can lead to an outside extreme candidate coming to power Again I think it wa a little long but one of my favorite of the bunch It wa still campy and obviously it not poetry but I enjoyed it for the most part While the allusion to Trump are very clear I think the writer also did a good job getting at some of the other underlying idea So wait no one question the kid Why is everyone just allowing these crazy thing to happen While a lot of people are pointing to this a a shortcoming in the plot I believe it an intentional component of the show if not the main point You meant to ask yourself why people look the other way when extreme happen in politics The YT video The Views and Vlogs A Is it possible be a good leader if you prioritize entertainment over substance B What happens if a portion populace also value entertainment over substance The Sheer Willingness to Elect a Child In time of turmoil can cynicism trump skepticism People can become so disillusioned with established norm that they believe something extreme if it feel like a better alternative to the status quo Considering Oliver lack of experience and knowledge and the kid doctor When people have disdain for the educated the traditional source of knowledge expertise and wisdom become ridiculed and devalued opening the door to pseudo truth in the mainstream Who need to know foreign policy when your view is new and different Considering his Mom When the person people meant to keep a leader in check also benefit from him being power can you really have unbiased oversight Considering the penguin video game for all no doctor and the swing in the office Norms are only norm because we follow them A lot of the thing held in place are held there by tradition What happens when someone ha no regard for institutional forbearance When someone come along and make a mockery of those norm the guardrail come off there a huge chance for the abuse of power While not ultra subtle I do think it wa effective I really enjoyed the episode and maybe because I do agree with the Politics of it Perhaps I looking at it too closely and seeing what I want to see another theme in the episode but I do think it could be a good learning tool about the factor that lead to extreme politics and the potential fallout Note I know politics is touchy and this is a heavily political episode but not looking to get into political debate here if possible,Maybe an unpopular opinion but I enjoyed episode 5 a few reason and a deeper look at some theme Spoilers episode 5 inside
386,BakeryBrad07,TwilightZone,Episode 2 wa by far the best It wa interesting from start to finish Episode 1 wa tolerable but had some predictability to it The other 3 have absolutely sucked This 5th episode wa so incredibly bad that I almost cried What a stupid ending Cmon I know they can do better than this,Every episode sucked except 1 and 2
387,525600Pepes,TwilightZone,Not having or inclined to get CBS All Access I have not seen any of the 2019 episode of the TZ reboot From what I see here I sadly seem not to be missing much Whatever I am a Star Trek fan too but for related reason have not seen the new series Discovery again from what I have seen on the ST subreddit I am not missing much there either The big difference for me is that while I don care for any ST podcasts I apparently join a decent sized contingent insofar a I rather enjoy Tom Elliot award winning The Twilight Zone Podcast or to be clear used to until he shifted focus from the original series and other related fascinating content such a interview with Serling to the 2019 reboot I make this post to gauge the extent to which the TZ community here share my regard for his podcast and wish that he at least in part return focus to the original series As evident from year old podcast episode in which he seemed skeptical that the reboot would happen he clearly wa dubious that his podcast even would have the chance to cover brand new episode a contemporary show He certainly had no such idea in mind when he started his podcast I hardly fault him for seizing the opportunity to change up from discussing a show couched in many way in it longish ago time to a modern version of it That said I basically have lost a podcast I no longer have occasion to enjoy or reason to hear I wish Tom Elliot would make a new podcast to focus on the new series and reserve the current podcast to discus the original one that said I realize he probably lack the amount of time to double his podcast workload Like I said I wrote this post to see how common my thought are here If the current situation work for everyone else then so be it if not any thought or suggestion for Tom Elliot are welcome,Open letter to Tom Elliot please resume covering the original TZ series on your podcast
388,nikiris,TwilightZone,The twilight zone wa usually a normal guy girl experience something strange They think they figured out what the strange thing is and how to deal with it only to find out they were wrong and have everything go horribly awry There wa mystery for the audience in figuring out what wa happening and trying to guess how thing would go terribly wrong That what missing from the new episode The part where a miscalculation blow up in our normal guy face Episode 1 had normal guy and strange happening but he wa basically able to fix everything with a self sacrifice which felt weak Imagine if he wa stuck with those change instead reap what you sow kind of thing The 2nd episode wa the best so far because our hero tried to save everyone but ended up causing the crash The closest to the original formula Episode 3 had a happy ending how often did that ever happen in the original run Episode 4 ruined the traveler twist First he wa using truth to cause chaos and discord then he started lying Our hero caused the invasion the impact of that wa lost because we were trying to figure out if the traveler wa lying The twist wa ruined Episode 5 could have been great if it wa at all plausible A child can be president and a child can be a doctor Wouldn the twist have been better if instead of a child doctor there wa a 25 year old doctor who wa terribly overworked because all older drs were forced to retire So the horrible medical mistake came from that instead Wouldn the plot have been better if a 35 year old with the mind of a child wa elected This wa basically a slap against trump anyway,spoiler what missing
389,BurdySeagull,TwilightZone,Hi I want to start a discussion on the imagery or dialogue in the 2019 Twilight Zone series with the mastermind Jordan Peele This isn the first time I have noticed these subtle sign It is stated that each episode is happening within The Twilight Zone but I absolutely love these little visual audial confirmation to the inevitable announcement from Jordan Peele The Narrator that we are In The Twilight Zone Please share any of your experience similar to this,Twilight Zone A Connected Universe
390,Slowspines,TwilightZone,It felt more like a twilight zone episode than any of the other previous 2019 one It wa a bit predictable but it wa entertaining Did you catch the reference to Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up,I just finished A Traveler and really enjoyed it
391,ninfan3000,TwilightZone,Peak cringe Couldn even finish the latest episode,This latest incarnation of Twilight Zone is a masterclass in shit television
392,ib_lancelot,TwilightZone,One critique I seen on this sub reddit about the 2019 series is that the episode twist are predictable I mean are you retarded or something a majority of the original series twist where very predictable Probably like 70 of the episode watched I immediately knew the twist or how it wa gonna end We five episode into Jordan Peele reedition of the series and every thread I see a major complaint is This episode twist wa predictable It not like the old series Eye of the beholder The Passerby The Silence Time enough at last Yall cant tell me yall didn know how these episode where gonna end Theres a problem with the new twilight zone episode Pacing and writing But they have good acting and direction Having a predictable ending didnt necessarily made the original bad but made the one you couldn predict stand out,It predictable
393,XanPerkyCheck,TwilightZone,nan,They should get Eric Andre to write and direct an episode
394,Logilly_12,TwilightZone,Spoilers just fyi Each week after I watch a new episode I bump into an article or post saying that the episode made no sense wa foolish poorly written and I honestly think people are missing the point I think people are looking at the episode only skin deep and are missing what Peele is actually trying to say Peele in all of his writing directing ha a TON of hidden meaning Just look at Get Out and Us he ha a surface deep story but there so much more he want the audience to figure out for themselves Let look at each episode so far Wunderkind On the surface it a silly story of a kid getting elected president but it really a thinly vailed criticism of Trump He literally used line close to what Trump ha said If you not with me it treason and his lack of performance in debate to display his childish nature If you rewatch and think of Oliver not a a kid but a the mind of the President it make it so much better A Traveler On the surface it just a poorly done Alien invasion but the theme of the episode is about lying I happened to be reading the Mueller Report when this episode aired and the tactic A Traveler us is so similar to how Russian interfered with the election through fake news and social medium A Traveler lied about everything to divide everyone and cause mistrust allowing them to invade or interfere Rewind This one might be the most clear message even from the surface being vigilant about biased police help keep them in check You could dive further by saying that the rewind is representing it happening over and over in society but I think Peele wa pretty clear on this one Nightmare at 30k ft From what I seen this is the most liked episode but even it ha a small deeper meaning beyond just a fun retelling of a classic episode Justin is a white guy who first look at Sikhs then Russians a potential problem when really the bad guy wa the white guy right beside him Peele wa hiding a message about domestic terrorism in the episode we accuse everyone else but ignore the threat here The Comedian I think this episode is Peele most personal He used to be just a comedian but a his game grew he had to give more and more of himself to the point that between the Twilight Zone and his film he probably ha very little personal time with his wife and son so he probably feel like he had to give them up for his fame The joke aren supposed to be funny in it they supposed to be sacrifice for fame With all this said I do understand the criticism people are going to like what they like and dislike what they don Yes some episode have been too long I seen the too political argument which is kinda dumb because Twilight Zone always ha been but I think a lot of the criticism is coming from people who haven tried to figure out what Peele is trying to say in the episode I think he honestly doing a great job of tackling modern concern without having to walk out at the end and say this episode wa about racism Rod Serling wrote a lot of episode the same way a vailed look at the issue of the time,People aren reading into the episode enough
395,Kessnerd95,TwilightZone,I can do it anymore I tired I tired of the shoddy writing and shallow commentary episode after episode I tired of deceiving myself into thinking the next one will be better It won This ha been a massive disappointment I a big fan of Jordan Peele but no episode here can even hold a candle to Get Out or Us Why someone a smart and talented a Peele would put their name on this show is beyond me I could go on but at this point it essentially beating a dead horse If this is the best they can do then it it better off forgotten As someone who think of New Year Eve a the Twilight Zone marathon weekend it time for me to cut my loss,I out
396,JackOfAllInterests1,TwilightZone,Try and rank all 5 episode they come out with so far,Rank all of the episode of TZ2019 so far

399,stayboogy,TwilightZone,Just let me say that I am completely blown away by the direction and suspenseful cinematics of the newest series Like Wow I have always loved the black and white episode but this series being brought back to modern time give me hope for the future of dystopian commentary show,Blown Away

402,frankay39,TwilightZone,I been watching the new series and went back and watched the pilot of the original Rod Serling show to compare Where is Everybody is far from the best episode of the old show but when I wa watching it I felt generally spooked and also completely unsure of what wa happening until the end I think that what I miss most from the new series Petty politics and opinion aside the new series ha yet to keep me guessing with clever twist and turn and one of the least memorable episode of the original series just did Food for thought,Perspective After Watching the Original Pilot
403,Lowkey_HatingThis,TwilightZone,So I had been watching the TZ ever since I wa about 10 I wait all year to DVR sy fy New year marathon I loved every episode sure some were not a good or classic but they were all interesting idea and every episode I never once questioned that I wa in the twilight zone and that these character were victim of it The new series I sorry I really wanted to enjoy it I really wanted to but it just is so all over the place and weak in it writing it not even funny I won discus the first two episode I watched those a few week ago and haven rewatched since so it wouldn be fair But I will discus episode 3 5 Episode 3 Surprisingly the episode with the least original idea device that can rewind time is actually the most original of the three because it isn just relying on the idea of famous episode from the original series The writing in this episode wa the strongest but I felt like the dialogue wa a little too on the nose But I wa very excited to see how this would end up Then the second half came and god wa it awful I understand what the message and meaning are behind it but it all over the place It felt like they wrote 70 of the episode realized they weren close to wrapping it up and just decided to end it with that scene The main character wa speaking like no one ever would in real life it wa so on the nose and corny And it couldn even keep it own message straight at first the main character go off about how their love will over come the fear but then later she claim she will always live in fear So what the message here minority will over come police brutality and racism or that police brutality and racism are so bad they will always have to live in fear Not only that but it really blew it load here and ha basically erased any chance to make another episode with theme of police brutality and police racism like this If they would kept it to just the one cop and had him confront them at the end it might been better But it had to be all no this one person is gonna show everyone that every cop is weak and racist because reason They put all the chip in on this one and it felt too forced and spoon fed like the episode wa saying hey in case you didn get the message this is a problem in our society At this point it stopped feeling like a TZ episode and started feeling like a poorly written political message The original series had alot of episode with the same political message so many about the cold war but it wa always do e through personal character to character interaction which is what this episode went for and then failed to do in the closer Episode 4 So did this one just have a different writer writing every 10 minute Holy moly it wa so hard to keep up with it at point The traveler wa just an odd as character they tried to give him this creepy mysterious aura but kinda wasted it by making his first 15 minute out to be some ecentric YouTube blogger also the last two episode felt like they were heavily plugging YouTube Then once he pardoned it literally is just the monster are due on Maple Street The writer knew exactly how bad they were copying that idea which is why they tried to make Yuka the central figure making the opening and closing narration about her knack for uncovering the mysterious in what way The whole episode she is no more remarkable than any other character the whole theme about what she want for Christmas and wanting to be in charge made no sense because her character just never reacted to any of it It further try to distance itself from TMADOMS by making the alien actually invade at the end but why even go through all the trouble of turning people against themselves if you just invade anyways You could literally just invade and knock out the power grid TMADOMS ended with the alien simply observing making minor adjustment and never revealing their purpose This episode tried to copy the magic that episode had and apply it McCarthy era paranoia message onto our fake news era but fell flat in it delivery with yet another episode of weak writing and an even weaker finish that felt like the writer forgot how much time wa left in the episode and just pushed the ending when they could cut out half the filler of the first half hour to make room for it Episode 5 Again it a copy of It a good life BUT I actually like the direction it took with adapting this classic idea Instead of a mentally god like child terrorizing a town it a manipulative child terrorizing the US government This core idea wa interesting and lead to some nice scene but damn this show cannot write character motivation to save it life It all so on the nose the campaign manager want to help Oliver because he really belief in his message he connects with people It trying to highlight how the American public is stupid because it would rather elect someone who seems genuine rather than a politician Yes this episode is trying to make fun of Donald Trump comparing him to a spoiled child But it fails miserably because they make Oliver a good president He keep all his promise his approval rating are high everyone love him So what the message here We should elect people like that And it also just can decide on what it want to be You have human moment like the campaign manager sitting at the bar talking about how he really believed in oliver Then you have stupid absorbed shit oliver literally changing the lighting of the room to make it more ominous btw this is so lazy I can believe they did it What director ha to have a character announce the change of lightning to make something ominous and then the secret service agent just shoot him for no reason he line 4 foot away from Oliver hand out and they draw their gun before Oliver even finish his sentence And that ending Wow the worst twist of them all It a stupid call back to a law that wa brought up a few time in the episode It make you go oh haha yeah he doesn want old doctor I get it where if you were to watch It a good life the episode this is trying to parody that ending just make you go Jesus Christ And why is that well that brings me to the final point Because it genuine It ha genuine human interaction that serve a allegory for well developed political message That what the original TZ had it had layer to it This new series is uninspired sloppy and lacking ant nuance at all It very disappointing it try to mask it plot hole and outlandish character motivation behind the idea that it the twilight zone thing are wacky here Overall the new series is a wacky le inspired Black mirror and that just the worst blow to rod serling legacy I can think of I will continue to watch and have high hope the next episode is the first space one and I always loved those original TZ episode but so far I can see

406,inspiteofMM,TwilightZone,Ending 1 I honestly thought the twist of this episode wa going to be that the son wa actually a murder and the cop recognized him in the diner The cop wasnt pursuing them because he wa racist he wa pursuing them because the son wa an actual dangerous criminal and the mom didnt know it And it would have been u the audience that wa the racist one in assuming that the cop wa pursuing them because he wa racist when in actuality he wa just doing his job The commentary of the episode would have been how racist u the audience wa because we were making all kind of assumption about the creator of the show amp x200B Ending 2 The mom go very far back in time and witness what happens to the cop wife That she wa shot and killed by an african american man that happens to look a lot like her son And this is the source of the cop reason for pursuing them all this time Not because he racist but because the son look like his wife murderer And maybe she us the camera to help the cop come to term with his wife passing and let go of the past amp x200B Ending 3 All the interaction with the cop were actually legit and the camera prof it by showing u the future and what would have happened if the cop didnt intervene The time the cop pull them over the first time for speeding and using a hand held device we see that if the cop didnt pull them over they would have crashed into another car When the cop asks them to move their car because it wa blocking the road we see that 1 minute later there wa another car on the highway that lost it brake and ha to use that road to safely slow down and stop But because the mom car wa blocking the road the other car crash into them When the cop go to the hotel it turn out that there wa a domestic disturbance the room nextdoor that break out into a fight When the cop approach the mom in the diner parking lot it turn out that someone had made a prank call and called in that the mom car wa stolen and the cop wa just investigating And when the cop stop them after they climb out of the sewer and are heading for the college it turn out that the mom brother actually had a bomb strapped to himself and wa going to blow up the school anyway I bet someone else can come up with better reason the point is to illustrate that the cop could have been the good guy all along amp x200B Ending 4 It wa always the son fate to be accidentally shot by that cop Not because he racist or anything but just simply a pure accident And each time she rewinded the camera and tried to prevent it fate kept on twisting thing to undo her interference making thing a little more messed up then what would have happened in the original timeline In the son own word everything thats supposed to happen happens Its all been predetermined since the big bang You cant change fate amp x200B Anyway these are just a few that I came up with off the tip of my head All of these feel more Twilight Zone y to me What do you guy think How would you have ended it Almost anything would have been better then what we got,Spoilers A Few Better Endings to episode 3 Replay

408,Milzingbar,TwilightZone,Does anyone remember an episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits Or perhaps it wa a movie about a guy who accepts something from a stranger he meet or agrees to do a favour for the stranger or something along those line and it result in the guy unwittingly assuming the identity life of that stranger I know the basic thrust of it but I can quite nail the detail precisely I think there wa a gift or a memento like a pocket watch that changed hand a part of the unwanted transaction and the unwitting recipient now had to pas it on to the next person before running out of time Vaguely the story mostly hit that tone however some of the beat may be off,Unwitting body swap

420,hithere297,TwilightZone,Some ground rule You have to be specific For instance if you say I make the Comedian twenty minute shorter you have to explain what specifically you cut to make the story work within that time frame and why that would make a better story Remember only one change per episode It could be something a small a a single line or something that would drastically alter the entire theme plot It ha to be something you can first sum up in one sentence and then elaborate a need be No excessive negativity I would make episode X not be trash type comment should be ignored If you only have idea for one or two episode feel free to just do those Example this is the thing I change for The Comedian I would cut the nephew character completely I think every other erasure in the episode serf to advance the plot characterization except this one The dog disappearing establishes the premise Joe Donner show that the power could be used for good the mentor show how it could be used for bad the two businessmen show how just far Samir moral have fallen etc The only disappearance that truly feel repetitive IMO is the nephew All it really doe is let Samir understand what happening but I think they easily could had him figure it all out after Donner disappeared and he would had almost exactly the same conversation with his girlfriend afterward a he did after the nephew It would also make Samir more sympathetic in the beginning so his moral decline would feel more powerful Having him shrug off his nephew erasure from existence make him look so much worse than shrugging off the erasure of a guy who killed a mother and child,You allowed to change ONE aspect of each episode of the reboot in order to make it better What would you change

431,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,The episode is a clearly an allegory A traveller represents weaponized misinformation the kind we seen recently on social medium The traveller us his seemingly true yet fake story conspiracy to divide the populace Like fake news he micro target specific people and us what he know about them to both manipulate their belief and gain control of what he want The various character in the story are tempted to believe the various myth if it either 1 appeal to their base fear or serf 2 benefit them in some way The writer seem to indicate that the latter is worse because you know it a lie deep down but you want to believe it so you become a willing participant The town represents a country and the episode show how easy it is for distorted rumor and misinformation to quickly disrupt a populace Some thing to support this theory A Traveler address is FB saw this on another easter egg in the sub B The allusion to a Russian Russian Invasion C The idea that some people are willing to let the world society burn because they want a new fresh beginning,SPOILERS Thread to discus the deeper meaning and subtext in episode 4
432,crazybusinessguy,TwilightZone,I enjoyed the first two episode this third episode tho I mean come on Pressing replay on an old camcorder just replay time I swear this is something a 7th grader could have written This episode felt le about a twilight zone complex and more about how racist some police officer are And the last 3 minute with her speech in front of the college wa so well speechy As if we hadn wasted 45 minute of our life getting that message hammered into our head Overall grade D I going to give Peele one more shot but if episode 4 is a stinker he lost this viewer,2019 Twilight Zone Ep 3 Replay
433,trostlerp,TwilightZone,I love the original Twilight Zone and the wide range of story it offered Some thoughtful some thrilling but all unpredictable and a treat to watch Having now watched the first 4 episode of this new series I don think I can handle any more letdown Not one episode ha felt up to the level of quality of Serling Matheson Beaumont Hamner script The tone of each episode so far ha felt off partially due to the extended running time The underlying message in the original weren necessarily subtle but the 2019 version seems to have substituted compelling tale with metaphor that hit the viewer over the head The twist thus far have been 0 for 4 and that one of the Twilight Zone trademark Even a lesser episode could be lifted up by a memorable ending There have been none in the 2019 version The Comedian wa a shaggy dog story with an obvious outcome that wasn satisfying with character that felt inconsistent throughout Tone wa a huge issue here and I not sure what the point wa Nightmare At 30 000 Feet wa my favorite so far but even then had an unnecessary coda Overall though it got me a little excited for what wa to come Of course it wa also the shortest episode so far and had a time element built in Replay had an interesting premise but wa distracted by tangent and the ending speech at the college wa insultingly preachy and out of place The coda here actually worked well but not at all after the speech Felt like someone thought the relevance needed to be more obvious at the expense of the story And now The Visitor wa an even bigger waste of time I get the fake news metaphor Hell I even agree with every political aspect the new Zone is getting into But a a narrative this wa nothing What the through line The arc How is the twist earned or satisfying I wa very excited for this remake especially with Jordan Peele being involved but with the next episode trailer feeling like a take on Trump with a literal child politician with matching temperament who not supposed to win I don feel the need to sit down any future Thursdays to partake Again I agree with the politics of the show thus far but the narrative have not been able to stand on their own Serling wa accused of being preachy in the 50 60 but at least his story were memorable thought provoking thrilling surprising and if not always great at least always worth a trip,Think I done

440,MrFack,TwilightZone,What did you guy think about it I watched the first two episode and I didn really appreciate the adult language I don think it needed and I found it a bit distracting A lot of the time when adult language is present it take away from the story and you end up focusing on that more in my opinion Also I get that every group need to be represented is popular but is it really necessary to mention a character is gay if it ha nothing to do with the plot Am I the only who doesn get that Those are just some thought I had How about you guy what did you think,So about the new series
441,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Little boy little boy with their head full up with dream And when do they find out Frances when do they suddenly find out that there ain any magic When doe somebody push their face down on a sidewalk and say to them Hey little boy it concrete That what the world is made out of concrete When do they find out that you can wish your life away Bolie Jackson People have a strange penchant for childhood innocence If show like Kids Say the Darndest Things aren evidence enough there the perpetuation of myth like Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy and pelican midwife I guess it endearing and nostalgic in a way like when it start raining and a kid remark how the sky peeing again When someone still learning about the world you get a vicarious sense of exploration and newness Maybe you just want them to revel in the idea of magic before life stomp it out of them To take in a world where anything is possible There probably better way to do this than flat out lying but it understandable After all a lot of these tradition function a a rite of passage of sort Of course this is trivial in a universe where magic doe exist It for that reason that translating this episode message to the real world can be tricky and why many people find this episode overly sentimental After all magic isn real and if so certainly not a spookerific a your favorite TV show If this were a real boxing match Bolie wouldn tve won because he believed in magic Twilight Zone ha a fondness for childlike wonder a episode like Mr Bevis and Kick the Can show But understandably magic is meant to be allegorical it may be substituting for a general sense of wonder religious faith what have you Even if magic isn real believing is very real and something to be treasured Believing is how you get show like the Twilight Zone amp x200B You might walk away going C mon Bolie why can you just believe All you had to do wa Bolie I really feel for Bolie When you grow up in an environment where you constantly knocked down it ha a big impact on your outlook on life And sure he could lie but deep down he know he doesn believe He can Believing can be the hardest thing ever And there clearly some cognitive dissonance going on Everybody tell Bolie that he wa never down and totally clobbered the great Consiglio and Bolie ha no choice but to smile and take their word for it Bolie doesn seem to have the greatest self esteem but he belief he won this on his own He strike me a the kind of guy who hasn had a lot of win He need this And that a terribly ironic power Henry wields Imagine having the power to wish anything but it only work if people believe in it magic Reminds me of Cassandra cursed clairvoyance It implied that Frances belief in Henry wish and there some fascinating subtext behind Henry other big tall wish the fact that he us his strongest magick to scrape together rent money suggests that they aren very well off Frances likely struggle to pay the bill a a single mother Henry and Bolie are on two side of the same coin They endured deep hardship in life Henry is idealistic and hopeful turning to magic a a mean of coping Bolie rant about child and trace over his scar Bolie used to be more hopeful but time take everybody out You get let down by enough wish and you just can wish no more He constantly refers to himself a an old man which double a commentary on how sport focus on the young That being said it not like he comically mopey all the time His good close friendship with Henry is downright adorable It nice that Bolie can be a father figure and you get the impression that Bolie himself doesn have many friend And on Frances brief characterization we see she cross her finger a Bolie leaf for his big match There a sign for a palmist outside of their apartment and another one outside saying What Is Truth More hint that the Twilight Zone magic isn meant to be taken literally No doubt Serling writing from the heart a he used to be a boxer Apparently he wa quite the berserker Seems odd but on the other hand Bob Ross used to be a drill sergeant The army doe weird thing to people He retired after his 17th bout given a severance package in the form of a broken nose This would go on to influence his writing most notably Requiem For a Heavyweight which solidified his place in television He belief a boxer is a piece of art chiseled by scar and gash It no coincidence that the last face Arch take in The Four of Us Are Dying is that of a boxer When Bolie talk about his scar it like I literally listening to Serling Boxing in general serf a a strong visceral metaphor to balance out the optimistic daydreaming with a hard punch of reality The way Bolie break his finger is a bit contrived I like what Thomas add to contrast Bolie and how he reinforces Bolie negative self image but the way it escalates leaf little impact Perhaps this episode biting off a little more than it can chew Ultimately it serf to remind u that there no way that Bolie gonna win the fight I might liked it more if they left some ambiguity to get the audience to feel hopeful for Bolie It also suggests some of Bolie pain is self inflicted And no Bolie you don need to remind u how Henry gonna wish you out of this one We get it The way the crowd scene is shot is rather interesting with still between a bunch of nervous hand Clearly they don have enough extra to fill a stadium so they have to go with this quirky approach It a little stilted but I find it a more powerful way of creating tension than just sweeping through a bunch of people hootin and hollerin It also reminds u of Bolie own busted hand I would liked it better if we didn see any of the crowd face that toothpick guy is rather distracting It cool how Henry mimicking some boxing move showing how these large televised event can affect people and showing how he rapt with focus It also reinforces how Bolie is a role model for Henry We get some more interesting shot a the camera crumples to the floor creating a unique perspective and getting u to fall with Bolie Apparently a later shot wa taken by filming upward underneath some glass This wa directed by Ron Winston who also did a fantastic job with The Monsters are Due on Maple Street and the le memorable Stopover in a Quiet Town It also worth noting that Jerry Goldsmith come in with an original score with some harmonica solo I mean we all know how powerful harmonica are This episode play with some familiar concept but pack powerful idea and executes them with a unique flair It make for a very distinct viewing experience even for the Twilight Zone We see Henry tending to some rabbit on the roof According to Wikipedia they symbolize vitality and resurrection so this is technically an Easter review happy zombie jesus day which might signify how Bolie rejuvenation It a little strange that Henry would have pet rabbit given his speculative financial situation perhaps he big tall wished for those too Reminds me of Of Mice and Men But I have to admit this scene work a lot better than it would in Henry room so I can work with it It also show Henry in a more parental role basically being forced to admit the truth He seems pretty guilty about it too like he staged the fight and he getting called out on it When Henry silently confirms Bolie suspicion Bolie start wringing Henry by the shoulder to some extent Bolie is aware that he didn deserve the win and it eating him up inside And up next is the most gut wrenching scene I get choked up every time When Bolie professes that he deserved the win you can see the nervousness in his eye he trying to convince himself that he deserved to win that he not a ha been that he worth something Even when he talk to Henry later he come up with excuse blaming the loss on his busted knuckle And a a result Bolie not only loses the match but also shake Henry faith It hard not to feel a tinge of sadness a you watch Henry childhood die a little But this isn because Henry experience the harshness of reality first hand rather he see what the harshness of reality can do to a person and how it can carve somebody with so little faith that they defeat themselves Life go on Bolie career a a boxer might be over but he still ha the rest of his life ahead of him and they gonna go to a hockey game and get frosty chocolate milkshake Even in time of disillusionment and hopelessness you still have love and I think that really sweet Cheesy but earned Despite criticism of sentimentality I think this is low key one of the saddest episode in the entire series These criticism probably come from the idea that if you wish hard enough for something it come true Idealistic yes but I choose to interpret it more a having self confidence and optimism As much a I hate to admit it there is power in positive thinking Even if you interpret Henry wish a magic or religious faith what wrong with telling people to believe in a better future Sometimes that all people have And this episode doesn condemn Bolie for his lack of belief it just point out that rampant pessimism can lead to a self fulfilling prophecy By all account he should lost that fight and he know it And rather than being sanctimonious or didactic this episode is earnest and admits that some people are dealt a bad hand in life and it affect the way they think And sometimes all you can do is be loving and supportive I probably be remiss if I didn say something about the cast they did great Ivan Dixon ha a good performance where he capture Bolie fury in a understated way while maintaining some degree of lightheartedness Stephen Perry doe well a a child actor lending that quiet intensity that every kid in the Twilight Zone seems to have And their sweet friendship balance the overwhelming sense of brutality and despair that box this episode This episode may be simple at it core but it hit you with the ol one two Because it painfully obvious Henry wish is going to work It obvious the first time he say it it obvious the second time it obvious when Frances affirms it and it obvious when Bolie reminds u before the fight And this whole time I thinking what the twist gonna be Will the wish backfire in an exceedingly ironic fashion No it take a fantastic concept and resolve it in a grounded way It seems like it just going through the motion until about 2 3rds through when it hit you with that strong emotional scene I find this episode very compelling It might not resonate with others a much but it still a strong episode in it own right and tends to be overlooked Highly recommend,The Groan Zone The Big Tall Wish Review
442,Yossi25,TwilightZone,I watched 3 episode so far 1 Was about a comedian who made people not exist by telling joke about them Then his life turned shitty so he made a joke about himself to commit suicide 2 Was about a guy who think the plane is going to get hijacked and crash It end up crashing at the end 3 I watched the newest one about the weird prisoner who made everyone turn on each other He ended up being an alien Each one of these episode were a chore to watch I wa bored out of my mind within 10 minute I feel like I missing an important message of each episode Like it could be a masterpiece but it whooshing over my head Is there something I missing here,Is there something I missing with the new Twilight Zone

445,FoxDieEeE,TwilightZone,nan,Unpopular Opinion The Rod Serling Twilight Zone wa better than the Jordan Peele version
446,ethan11698,TwilightZone,After watching the original series I found some episode were amazing however I remember being a few episode that I really didn enjoy such a I Sing the Body Electric Young Man Fancy and The Mighty Casey What are some episode you didn enjoy,What are your LEAST favourite episode from the original series
447,RadioGhibli,TwilightZone,Like many of you I grew up on the Twilight Zone My mother actually watched them growing up in the 60 and would tell me Twilight Zone episode for bed time story when I wa a child And when I wa old enough I bought all the DVDs back when they were the 5 episode volume While I am only 31 I absolutely adore the series and have seen every episode hundred of time I even thought the 80 version wa criminally underrated it had some dud but it also had some incredible gem And while the 00s reboot wa mostly bad I still had been craving the series to make a return So when I heard Jordan Peele wa going to relaunch the series I wa beyond ecstatic I love Peele and it just felt like the right time for the Twilight Zone to finally come back But my god ha this been one big let down after the next I going to try to break down the issue I have with it in point The episode length is a detriment When the original series went with the hour format in Season 4 it wa definitely a mixed bag I would say the majority of the episode were worse for it The latest reboot suffers the same issue The very first episode The Comedian actually had an interesting premise But it wa 100 unpleasant to watch given how long the thing dragged out So far I felt this way about all the episode where I either feel they go on too long or the writer squander the time they have But these would be much better in the shorter format Especially since the writer seem to want to overtly hammer the message of the episode over and over the length just make it redundant The new series completely miss the spirit of the original with how it tackled social political subject One of the thing I keep seeing people say to defend the reboot is that the original talked about poltiics So clearly you havent seen the original While it true the original series talked about social political issue and even had episode that reflected the time the issue is not that it poltiical it the way the new series talk about these issue The orignal used sci fi fantasy to tell a story hence taking u to another dimension which then had store that reflected issue of the day The writing wa nuanced and subtle Which then made the revelation all the more shocking and horrifying because you realized that in the real world thing like that are actually happening and isnt so different from the dimension you were taken to The new series hit you over the head and preaches with activist style writing and isnt subtle at all The social poltical stuff drive the story and the twilight zone sci fi stuff take a back seat Even if you agree with the politics of the show it really poorly done The original wanted everyone to watch it including the people or idea it wa critical of This is related to the section above but latest reboot take the modern you are either with u or you are the enemy attitude of modern activism The first episode literally open with a 3 min rant on Gun Control and how one side is crazy and stupid While the other side is clearly the good guy and sane Completely ignoring the fact that many gun owner actually want regulation And that there is a much more complicated reason for why some beleive we should have gun instead the episode boil it down to hur dur muh right Point being the orignal series would have wanted gun owner to watch it and through a story it would try to convince them to change their mind The new series just straight up attack people and insult them if they arent on the right side of thing And IMO this is a major failure of the new series And even if you agree politically socially so you are on the side of the show it just circle jerking yeah fuck the other side kind of writing and that is really below what the series should be about I loved the original because it wa draw people into the story and everyone could relate to it And if you were someone that didn agree with the politics of the show it would actually make you think why you might be wrong The writing is really messy sloppy The latest episode The Traveler is a perfect example of this The fact that it ha 50 min to tell it story and yet it still seems to be that muddled confusing is amazing The story itself make sense If you step back it easy to get But understanding the character motivation and the little detail of what is going on is a damn mess By the end of the episode it feel abrupt and you dont really care why the two character are doing what they are doing There is such a big disconnect While the other episode don feel a sloppy writing wise they all suffer the same issue of feeling overwritten Rewind is just straight up awful The first 20 min of the episode had me glued to my seat The way they used the rewind mechanic made you truly feel the fear that a minority feel in this country afraid of the police Its a never ending hell because you feel like no matter what you do you are always on edge afraid However the episode quickly turn into a cartoon by making the racist cop a terminator like presence The guy just show up wherever whenever The reason for him escalating dont make sense And again I get there are example of cop escalating over small thing in the real world But the show ha that moment where they humanize the cop when the mother talk to him Only for a second later for him to turn into the Terminator out for blood It clashed tone wise I also feel it cheapens racism One of the horror of racism is that racist people are human We have to accept this Its a mistake to paint horrible people who do abhorrent thing a this magical evil It take away from the motivation of why they do what they do It take away the enviroment that shaped them The episode then crescendo into them literally using a modern take Underground Railroad system and then having a stand off between an entire university and a bunch of racist Cops Again the concept itself isnt bad The way it executed wa completely hamfisted and cringe There were so many way that episode could have been done in the spirit of the orignal series and it would have actually been more powerful then the faux empowerment of the episode In conclusion so far this new reboot ha been a big let down The cinematography is absolutely stunning The acting for the most part is brilliant This show ha everything going for it But so far I found the vast majority of the episode to be unpleasant or riddled with glaring flaw The Travler should have been a slam dunk The setting wa brilliant Again it looked gorgeous Steven Yeun wa incredibly disturbing And yet the whole thing wa just wasted A muddled mess They couldnt even do a monster of the week style episode right And that really make me think this series is going to continue to be mediocre And that suck so bad,I really don like the new series
448,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,I not sure if this is an unpopular opinion because I seen either extreme praise or extreme hatred I ok with the show just being pretty good haha I think it def in the rubbing for the best reboot and it obviously not a good a the original Of course it very campy at time but overall I still enjoying tuning in for each new show It may be bc I a TZ nerd but I love getting to discus the episode each week with you all I also like how they at least attempting to take on difficult subject that a lot of other show would avoid When all is said and done I hope we get a few solid episode and hopefully some food for thought,Anyone else feel the new show is being held to an unnecessarily high standard A cover band is never better than the original but if you know that going in you can still enjoy the music

450,lizard81288,TwilightZone,I guess I to blame too since I judging the new season and comparing it to the old one so I thought it would only be fair to judge the OG Twilight Zone first few episode Just for fun I threw in episode 4 too 1 Where Is Everybody A man find himself alone on a dirt road dressed in a U S Air Force flight suit having no memory of who he is or how he got there 2 One for the Angels Lou Bookman is a kindly sidewalk pitchman who sell and repair toy notion and trinket and is adored by the neighborhood child One day Bookman is visited by Mr Death who tell him that he is to die at midnight of natural cause Unable to dissuade Death Bookman instead convinces him to wait until Bookman ha made his greatest sale pitch one for the angel 3 Mr Denton on Doomsday Al Denton wa once known a the quickest draw in town but riddled with increasing guilt over the loser in his gun duel one of whom wa a teenage boy he became an alcoholic wreck and the laughing stock of the community A mysterious salesman named Henry J Fate cause Denton to inexplicably regain his expert shooting touch and once again inspire the respect and awe of the townsfolk which Denton explains will only cause reputation hungry gunslinger from mile around to seek him out and inevitably kill him Soon enough a challenge is delivered which Denton dare not refuse 4 The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine Aging film star Barbara Jean Trenton secludes herself in her private screening room where she reminisces about her past by watching her old film from the 1930s From the Wikipedias,To be fair to the New season how good where the first 3 episode of the 50 version

457,aTVisAthingTOwatch,TwilightZone,Hello fellow Twilight Zoner With the release of the new reboot it came to my attention that this sub wa in dire need of some moderation so I messaged the mod and they were nice enough to make me a mod a well saying they had been lazy with the sub and agreed it needed attention Anyways I have been trying my best to bring the life back into this sub and I wa hoping you guy could help me As you can see I plan to have stickied thread for discussing the new episode but I think it would be fun to do something else also I wa thinking maybe weekly daily discussion thread on different episode or something of the like but I don want it to be boring or something that doesn have much content What are your thought on this Would love to see more activity in this sub,Suggestions for the sub
458,whurpo,TwilightZone,I didn have incredibly high hope for this reboot of the twilight zone but I wanted to give it a shot because I always loved the original show Regardless I been disappointed Peele latest iteration seems to completely miss the point of TZ For one thing it wa never a scary show It been mischaracterized and satirized a a show that creeped people out because of it surreal and suspenseful element but Serling story had heart the message were simple and powerful and the performance were profoundly human Perhaps the greatest thing about it wa that it wa television that made you think Peele is somehow being hailed a a master of horror and story but all I seen so far from the guy is clumsy metaphor and overacted performance by diverse cast His star studded overproduced superficial misinterpretation of the twilight zone come off a more of a vanity project that rather than a medium for producing a tranquil thoughtful audience a the original did and is adding more fuel the ongoing political fire raging in America It feel like any other show except in this dimension Peele comedian friend are acting scary Truthfully I think this is the right time for a twilight zone reboot but i don think Jordan Peele is the right man for the job TLDR Jordan peele shouldn have been the guy to reboot the show What do you think,No Jordan No

489,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,I wanted to contribute my 4 major point to improve this incarnation of the show Before I get into it I want to say I really happy you have brought it back This post isn meant to castigate you clearly putting a lot of effort and I a no one As a fan I hope to be helpful and supportive giving my opinion constructively is the most I can do on that front I fully recognize how difficult it must be to reboot a classic TV show Please don be discouraged because watching it ha been a highpoint of my week and I enjoyed the show besides a few minor quibble complaint Here are 4 major point I think can improve the show Fair warning there are a few small spoiler about the new series ahead 1 The Narration isn just a quirky feature it serf a function The opening and closing narration are essential element of the show It often feel like the TZ reboots have treated the narration portion a an aside or a low effort box to tick before moving on the story As I see it the intro outro purpose is two fold A The intro narration often give u a summation of the character inner world and other perspective we may not have been privy to seeing It characterizes their biggest flaw and their greatest triumph wish and aspiration This set the stage and involves u a an active participant in the show If this is skipped it at great detriment to the viewer B The closing narration often provides u with insight It delivers a message commentary or point toward something we should look for in ourselves or in society It show u that thing we just watched wa a parable and sometimes in 4 or 5 sentence we given the key to unlock it Provide Insight distribute wisdom and let u know the profundity of why it important we understand what you seeking to express 2 The Twists serve to enhance the message and serve the story not vice versa Serling primarily used the show a an avenue to deliver social commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling While not every episode of the original series wa great in the classic episode the twist ending enhances the message of what we just seen When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist and not the other way around you lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone wa trying to teach u To more effectively use a twist we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered If the twist go against the message of the episode or make the message more difficult to interpret I argue it losing some efficacy Additionally not every episode need a twist As long a the writing moral and message are strong and there is an element of the mysterious the will translate to the TZ format 3 Keep it short Pick one message and dive deeply into it I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issue of today i e social division unchecked paranoia artistry v commercialism etc That said one reason the original series wa so successful wa because each episode had one central theme obsoleteness mob mentality racism hatred etc In exploring that central theme deeply the show wa able to touch on other area a well It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issue of our day the viewpoint isn fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dive deeper than the service level I think keeping the episode to 30 35 minute picking a direction and diving deeply into exemplifying the peril of police brutality social division social medium etc will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham fist a many element into each episode a possible Keep tackling the hard topic but focus your scope 4 Don be afraid to use parable Serling wa constricted in what he wa allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the way he told story This constriction proved to be a strength a it allowed him to communicate difficult message to people who otherwise may not have listened Rather than talk about the danger of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil Rather than overtly discus the evil of racism he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark Rather than confront people fear of immigrant he used an alien who came to earth in need of help Rather than well you get the point Serling wa masterful using parable to communicate message that ran deeper than surface level viewing I think using this device would not only enhance the show it would increase conversation and repeat viewing So if anyone reading this is part of making this series I want to say thank you and you off to a great start I look forward to more episode and keep it up Also take with a grain of salt because just my two cent Thank you for reading,Lifelong fan here if anyone who work on the show lurks on this sub

500,jlozier891,TwilightZone,Fuck it I going in head first at this episode I think it called replay I don care enough to check the full title It suck that I have to make this disclaimer but my hatred for the episode ha nothing to do with it theme and meaning TZ ha always had political and social commentary hidden behind the sci fi I think the theme wa both current era appropriate a well a something I think should be discussed The first half of the episode I actually enjoyed The cop wa genuinely scary the main character trying to figure out what happened is a TZ cliche that really doesn annoy me The other half made me want to rip my hair out The entire uncle character should been cut My god that entire scene where they were planning they way into the college felt so out of place I seriously wanted to close the app because I felt like I wa watching a zombie movie Then the climax scene with the police showing up wa just so ridiculously corny The weird triumphant music while the main character speech to evil by using emotion and love wa so incredibly annoying to me It fall so flat because it so unrealistic nobody talk like that in real life A cop or someone who ha such a huge power trip wouldn even bother to register the word coming out of her mouth I hate to put Twilight Zone and Tumblr in the same sentence but that ending could been written by Tumblr and I wouldn be able to tell the difference How could they butcher such a good first part with a pointless ending and an even more pointless epilogue something that further pushed the episode from being a TZ one into a short film I seriously think this entire episode would worked if they made an hour longer fleshed out the uncle character changed the title to something else and completely remove the episode from the Twilight Zone brand and Peeles narration In other word It felt nothing like a Twilight Zone episode,Wow new episode wa just a bad Twilight Zone episode

single word including proper noun have swapped meaning And that the low key horror I beginning to expect from 80 Farmer Jack As funny a it is to hear people speak gibberish like it a normal thing it would be mind crushingly horrible to not only not understand anything no speech no writing nothing And everything that come out of your mouth make you sound like a babbling veil There are actual disorder like this people with receptive aphasia have damage in the Wernicke area the part of the brain responsible for processing language This can be caused by stroke injury brain tumor dementia it incredibly sad to see a loved one go through this I might liked it more if we got to see more of Kathy reaction but their son steal the spotlight Donnie illness seems mostly incidental but it doe add tension and the scene where Kathy and Hinge hug is really heartwarming You can tell he really needed that It also compelling how through his action Kathy can still see that he care deeply about their son despite being incoherent I like the dinner scene too You really wanna root for Hinge and see him get through this The ending end on a slightly depressing note acknowledging the reality that Hinge is gonna have to learn this language all over again except he ha to forget everything he already know I don know if this is easier or harder than learning a completely new language I go with harder since the word seem to be swapped at random without any reed of grammar For all we know throw is now fax and threw is now diphthong Still you wanna root for him And holy lederhosen do I hate the closing narration We know you didn come up with a reason We get it You don have to go into how slippery existence is or how Bill the tenacious everyman Honestly I wa disappointed in no opening narration but if this is the best you can do just scrap the narration completely I won miss them And for the record if you didn insist that this happened for no reason I would assumed it wa because he wa so focused on memorizing a bunch of medical jargon at the beginning It not a great impetus but it better than just going lol some thing just happen for no reason in the farmer jack character is what really matter This episode is a clever mix of comedy and drama Seeing people randomly swap out word and eventually devolving into gibbering beast is funny to u but with context it horrifying I argue 60 Farmer Jack doesn have it balanced a well though it might just come from the strong concept alone It also funny watching people try to spout nonsense with a straight face Cindy snicker a little while giving Hinge the timid waffle guarantee The neighbor stumble over encyclopedia a little bit I not 100 convinced these people think they saying something meaningful but the absurdity of what they saying make up for it I think the hospital scene wa one of the better spoken gibberish and you think that would cut the tension of the situation but not knowing how Donnie gonna do actually make it more tense I have a few small nitpicks like the overly dramatic wind that start blowing when Kathy say dinosaur Twice But for an episode that hinge on it concept it executes it serviceably and I probably put this a a decent plus episode when stacked up to the 60 series amp x200B Also I appreciate the minor insight that a lot of background sound get filtered out I didn catch the radio thing on my first watch nor did I end up paying too much attention to the gibberish background noise or the hospital speaker And I hope somebody out there with more love and patience than me try to decode some of these word I not sure how much thought the writer put into them but I do hear certain word pop up multiple time so I sure there a cipher rotting in a dumpster somewhere So the next time you see a foreigner trying to learn your native tongue maybe show them some kindness I hope the world last for you,The Groan Zone Wordplay Paste

523,bigboiAnakin,TwilightZone,Anyone know why it rated tvma,Why the tv MA rating
524,trover2345325,TwilightZone,I just wanted to point out a a reminder that the 2019 reboot of the twilight zone is rated TV Ma and not TV 14 due to imdb error a it is confirmed from CBS all access And it doesn matter because the twilight zone is always aimed for an older demographic and mature audience That is all,Just a reminder Twilight zone 2019 is rated TV MA not TV 14
525,WestWonWildly,TwilightZone,Watched the first ep read all the review I so disappointed and I wasn expecting much This isn a topic for people to chime in and defend the show but for u OG fan who are sad they just tacked the Twilight Zone name onto something subpar I really wish we got that DiCaprio Zone film instead of this cut paste Black Mirror,Come in here if you aren happy with the new Twilight Zone
526,ZachFoxStudios,TwilightZone,I just watched the first episode of the Twilight Zone reboot and while it definitely wasn terrible I felt there wa something missing I thought the cinematography wa fairly good the score wa also pretty good and the performance were all fairly solid But the story wa kinda lacklustre What I think wa missing wa an air of mystery throughout the whole episode we know exactly what is going on and more importantly why it going on The only thing that unknown to audience it how it will end but even that predictable A fix to this would be to remove the character that tell our main character what to do and have him discover that he ha the power himself which would lead audience to question what going on and why it going on Rather than him admitting he want fame we see his power fame slowly drive him crazy It would also probably chop down the runtime and leave u to slowly figure it out all the while create this sort of mysterious tone Rather than just flat out telling u what wa going to happen and why from the get go This is just my opinion but I definitely still interested in seeing where they take this series,So I just watch The Comedian I think I figured out why it didn click with me
527,jkw118,TwilightZone,Ok so year ago when I wa a kid I remember seeing one where the guy or his wife I think it wa his wife buy life insurance policy on him Some ridiculous amount In any case part of the life insurance is that they put this thing on him which he can take off and whenever something happens ie fall down heart attack etc It creates a foam cast on the guy and freeze him till they get him to the hospital What the heck show episode wa it any link etc,Looking for Lifeinsurance Twilight Zone

543,UsefulCamel,TwilightZone,Incredibly impressed My wife keep laughing because I normally can enjoy anything and I smiling ear to ear The intro song perfect no more Korn The intro video near perfect would have liked the window to smash not cry about it Peele narrator the omnipresent narrator living not in the real world or imagination but somewhere between perfect Episode 1 The Comedian I agree with all of you could have been a tad shorter Not 24 minute like some of you are suggesting It an intro to the series it should be longer Cut 7 minute out and you good The tone though absolutely perfect A rise a fall a selfless ish redemption Subtle hint to other horror movie in there the name The Torrances and the last shot I loved it Episode 2 Only complaint Why use the name The name is iconic with a specific storyline Call it anything else and it a perfect episode They build on the paranoia the sense that we know something is coming and no one belief u And then the twist at the end Just so perfect I got very high hope for this reboot a a kid that grew up watching the marathon every July and January growing up I went to film school because I would spend my free period modernizing TZ screenplay in high school I a miserable jerk Not much make me happy Episodes 1 and 2 they made me happy The tone is CORRECT They did an amazing job High hope,This made my insert any time frame you like
544,mat623,TwilightZone,nan,I think the comedian wa way too long too much filler The overall message of the episode wa confusing
545,mat623,TwilightZone,nan,So what wa the message of The Comedian
546,Ghidoran,TwilightZone,So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theory about it one is a mindbending Shyamalan esque twist the other is more metaphorical Theory 1 Sameer is a comedian past his prime with no friend or family due to his focus on his career and the whole episode is a delusion created by him to have a positive explanation for his current life Expanded Sameer wa actually a very successful comedian and the life he ha near the end of the episode no girlfriend or friend is his real life His heyday is behind him however and a his career start to slow down he realizes how empty his life ha become He wa too consumed with fame and ended up making no real friend or having a family Unable to cope with both a faltering career and no relationship to fall back on he begin to concoct this crazy delusional fantasy that he wa a struggling stand up comedian who had a loving girlfriend and friend but then he discovered the secret to making people laugh i e the plot of the episode Basically he pretend he got rid of old good life in order to become famous Ultimately he realizes his selfishness and give it all up by destroying himself thereby becoming an unknown This false reality help him cope with the sad situation of his current life At the end of the episode he doesn even exist to these people he just another memory of the comedy club immortalized in the photo This isn some supernatural trickery from Tracy Morgan it just the reality of a comedian who hit it big and then faded into obscurity Theory 2 The whole episode is an allegory for suicide and Sameer is actually a heavily distressed man who end up destroying his relationship with people around him and eventually kill himself Expanded Sameer is a very depressed He try to tell joke to make himself feel better hence why he see himself a a comedian tear of a clown and all that but in reality he continuously miserable represented by his inability to be successful He slowly destroys his closest relationship represented by the people he joke about disappearing in the episode which is something that happens in real life for some people with depression He doe this partly to make himself feel better represented by his newfound fame but ultimately he realizes he the cause of the pain At the end in a desperate bid to make everything right i e to get rid of the source of the pain he kill himself represented by him joking about himself and thus disappearing The end of the episode is a fantasy he envisioned with the people he loved going on with their daily life happy and him just being a forgotten memory represented by him being one of the photo on the wall These are just my theory anyway Obviously the surface level interpretation of the episode is don sacrifice friend and family for personal gain but I like to think there more to the episode Let me know your thought,Two theory about The Comedian
547,thatredbeanie,TwilightZone,The podcast host in Nightmare wa the host of the NoSleep podcast right I haven been able to find anything definitive Anyone back me up,So that wa David Cummings right
548,CannedInk,TwilightZone,They didn laugh when he repeated his old joke because his curse over the audience had no effect because it only worked if he kept going with new target showing that it wasn the joke but the curse that made them laugh in the first place They immediately began applauding at his low level humour when he chose new target that were personal to him the lack of humor over the Nazi he didn really know didn land a laugh showing that he couldn just choose any evil that wa foreign to him a a target I feel like that point is getting missed by the amount of criticism over his joke It go back to his point about the value in his humour and not wanting to stoop to the level of other comedian for the fame and eventually he address it his final act Ranty but feel like we should address the fact that his joke being bad but getting a laugh wa the point He wa cursed to only get a laugh when he gave up thing personal to him not given the gift of better comedic writing,The Comedians joke were meant to be dumb
549,GilliamFan17,TwilightZone,I about 20 minute in and I realized why it so visually unappealing it wa shot for black and white The soft focus hard shadow and awkward closeup would all play much better in black and white but don fit the medium of color I think that this is evidence that the reboot wa not meant to be in color but one of the CBS higher ups must have changed their mind,Why The Comedian Looks So Ugly
550,P-terson,TwilightZone,Whenever the main character go to check his contact for Devan his contact include many name of character from classic episode Henry Corwin from Night of the Meek Peter Corrigan from Back There Al Denton from Mr Denton on Doomsday Al Cadwallader from Escape Clause James Corry from The Lonely James Embry from King Nine Will Not Return and possibly more that I missed Very clever allusion to the classic character of the series,Did anyone else notice this in The Comedian

553,Mohamad979,TwilightZone,Its seems my previous post about the new twilight zone show were controversial to say the least So I just wanted to give a honest critique about the first episode and intrested to what you guy have to say I think the main reason i didn really like this first episode wa not the vulgarity or the 1 hr running like alot of people pointed out The main reason why I didn enjoy it wa the main character wa in control of the twilight zone causing the twist to be seen from a mile away The first episode reminded me me of a mature goosebump episode with a mix of a game of pool I wonder what you guy think,My honest critique about The Comedian
554,kristin137,TwilightZone,People are crazy There have only been 2 episode so far and even if they not perfect lot of show have a rough start On Amazon there are dozen of 1 star review about what a horrible leftist agenda the first episode ha no one want to see anything from Jordan Peele who is now a racist and also profanity is the worst thing that ha ever happened,Have you guy seen the Amazon review
555,TallTitan34,TwilightZone,Wouldn everything go back to the way it wa because Tracy Morgan would have never existed,What If The Comedian Told A Joke About Tracy Morgan
556,BigOlDisneylandNerd,TwilightZone,I feel like the only one who walked away with my jaw on the floor after The Comedian Like yes you would probably get the episode right away after a while but it wa just SO well done showing Sameer descent into madness and that little nod at the end to The Shining Wow I had my mouth covered the last 10 15 minute or so despite guessing how it would have ended That how I like my Twilight Zone About to start the second episode soon I have very high hope for this,Completely Mindblown
557,aTVisAthingTOwatch,TwilightZone,In the very first episode Where is Everybody the scene where Mike Ferris becomes trapped in the telephone booth wa actually based on an incident that happened to Rod Serling in real life Serling recounted that he wa at an airport making a phone call when he heard the boarding call for his flight over the intercom Hastily trying to get out of the booth he started pushing on the door forgetting in his panic that phone booth are opened by pulling on the door handle Serling waved down a passerby for help and the man kicked in the door Though Serling found his mental lapse humiliating he incorporated it into this episode,Today I Learned
558,RecyclopsPolluticorn,TwilightZone,I tried to laugh along with the audience but couldn I stopped watching 10 minute in so maybe it got better Why couldn he have just told the Thanksgiving Parade story instead That shit kill,The Twilight Zone I just wish Kumail Nanjiani joke were better
559,OldTrailmix,TwilightZone,Nightmare at 30 000 foot wa by far my preferred episode of the two released today and that is for it ability to rework a classic story into something new and thought provoking The tenseness of air travel in our modern world i e post 9 11 is perfectly represented In the 1963 episode you have a guy that absolutely losing his shit next to his wife and no one really give a fuck besides trying to calm him down In the 2019 version nobody on the plane is putting up with any fuckery Adam Scott character is supposed to be a master of civility yet his best attempt although misconstrued to save the flight are met with open hostility culminating in a zip tie Adam Scott character ha become a widely published magazine author by championing civility but at the end he is murdered by an unruly mob I think this is the meta commentary of this episode At least in the United States a lot of center left Democrats embrace civility a a mean to move the country forward Yet Republicans maintain their power despite not having the favor of the majority They take the low road and win I know this sound like soapboxing but this point is reinforced a Adam Scott magazine article is quite literally about civility in politics there is a Statue of Liberty on the cover On top of that Scott is taking a flight to Tel Aviv a hotspot of political unrest and violence Wherein Palestinians are being subjugated by Israel a client state of the US Not a lot of civility there As if that weren enough Scott character reference doing work in Yemen where Saudi Arabia us US funded arm to fight a proxy war with Iran Not a lot of civility there either Then we reach the end of the episode Scott character is killed by the unruly mob Where the civility there It absent Scott civility ultimately only killed himself Scott is the lone dumbass who gave the cabin code to an alcoholic ex pilot He wa a dope The lesson is not to listen to someone just because they reassure you that you right that they have power and can save you You have to stand by your belief and think critically Scott meeting someone in the middle of the road no matter how flawed they are mentality doomed him,Nightmare at 30 000 foot wa fucking great and here why
560,humming_bear,TwilightZone,Overall I loved the episode Misty if the complaint I seeing I don agree with but to each their own Meanwhile my complaint hadn been posted I did not like the swearing I know it an adult show I know that cursing and crass language is common to the point of being the norm That being said twilight zone to me wa always the epitome of class It didn descend to being common It sought to promote thought and discourse Can that still happen when character are saying fuck and pussy Probably but it alters the tone of the show for me I suppose I being a prude or too nostalgic maybe Just a half baked thought,Odd complaint about The Comedian
561,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,It ha to be one of them anyway,Is suck my vagina the stupidest line uttered in a Twilight Zone episode
562,steven10090,TwilightZone,I love the twilight zone but also enjoy the outer limit but don understand why one became more popular than the other,Why did twilight zone become more popular than the outer limit

564,deficiency_xsgx,TwilightZone,nan,Im so glad they chose to use the original music for the new show I always get chill when i hear those three note
565,_alphabot_,TwilightZone,after watching the first episode of the reboot i found myself wanting to watch the original in it entirety since it so easy to access through streaming but i am a bit overwhelmed at the number of episode i know there fan favorite and immediate classic but are there any episode i can skip over just to cut down on the amount of material the original offer or is every single one worth watching also are any of the other reboot attempt worth looking into and if so are those streaming anywhere thanks y all,watched the first episode of the reboot and have question about the original
566,TrickyGypsea,TwilightZone,I dont have cable I live in Canada Does anyone know where i can find the first episode Cheers,Ive been searching for hour
567,babubaichung,TwilightZone,nan,Disappointed with the first episode I don want to obviously think that the entire reboot is bad but I am definitely disappointed by the first episode It wa long slow the acting fell flat I really hope it get better Cheers
568,stolenmerch,TwilightZone,In response to some of the bad review of The Comedian of being too political which I didn find to be that true I seen others claim this wa the entire point of the original series which I don find to be that true either Yes there were definitely political episode e g I Am the Night Color Me Black but I thought most episode were standard sci fi paranormal twist with many being more universal social commentary about morality and internal individual struggle For me political mean an episode ha some allegory about contemporary current affair Do you all feel the original series is overtly political in nature,Was the original series actually that political
569,bigboiAnakin,TwilightZone,I see a ton of people hating on it but I thought The Comedian wa a little predictable but fun and I really enjoyed 30 000 foot Also I thought Jordan Peele killed a host and I like that the episode are longer Can wait for next week,I I the only one who actually like the new episode
570,trover2345325,TwilightZone,Hey what if I say that the audience score of Twilight zone 2019 series is 53 which is not good http www rottentomatoes com tv the _twilight _zone _2019 s01 audience _reviews http www rottentomatoes com tv the_twilight_zone_2019 s01 audience_reviews because with this rating I have a feeling that this series will run for 2 or 3 season amp x200B But on the bright the user score of metacritic is 8 9 which is good,Twilight zone 2019 rotten tomato audience score is 53
571,Darthmemer1234,TwilightZone,A big problem with the other reboots imo wa that they didn do the narrator gimmick justice Of course Rod Serling can never be replaced but Jordan is so good His deep foreboding voice is absolutely perfect for the show I loving it so far,Does Anyone Else Love Peele Voice
572,JuliusHibbert,TwilightZone,I know there are a bunch of way to interpret this episode but a comment and a question by u SentimentalSentinels inspired me to type and share my take on it One of my favorite part of watching the Twilight Zone is dissecting the meaning and seeing what we can take from it Much like the original this episode wa a study in paranoia personal mentality and distress In my view Bob the pilot exemplified how authority figure often exploit those fear to serve their own purpose Unlike the original the monster in this episode wa fear paranoia and the danger of how that manifest i e seeing connection that don exist distrust of others prejudicial thinking conspiratorial thinking blaming others etc Furthermore I think the argument could be made that the monster is Sanderson himself but unlike the first iteration of the show the writer hint that the monster within u is more dangerous than the unknown monster outside on the wing u SentimentalSentinels also made a great point about how they use the podcast to exemplify how sensationalism in the medium play a role in feeding these emotion I e the podcast Sanderson article etc To go one level deeper in my view Bob the pilot personified how a person of semi authority can parrot our concern to play into our greatest fear Once we feel that that person truly understands u or that they are the only one who can help they use their power to exploit our clouded judgement to cause chaos great harm The saddest part wa that Sanderson wa so blinded by desperation and fear that he didn realize he wa helping to cause the chaos he wa desperately trying to prevent The pilot played on Sanderson paranoia and fear to seize control and takeover the plane and achieve the end he sought Depots and demagogue use this tactic the time They demonize an other a a source of a problem play into the fear of a large population of people and use it to seize power and control for their own power control Much like the episode the depot oftentimes do this at the expense of the people they claimed they were helping I think this episode can be interpreted a a microcosm of that behavior Know this may be a reach and your mileage may vary but I really enjoyed it and just wanted to include my two cent Please post your theory or commentary would love to hear all the differing opinion and hopefully have my mind opened to thing I hadn considered,The deeper meaning amp subtext in Nightmare at 30 000 foot
573,bogdaddy12,TwilightZone,Watched the first episode I had faith not going to lie that they wouldn inject politics into this but ala And I saw all the preview for the other two episode Really I guarantee you that we aren going to get a white straight male who is remotely good or not written to be a strawman Thank Hollywood,Another show ruined by liberal politics
574,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Hey you totally killed tonight Guy Oh thank you you know I actually un killed two people Samir amp x200B And just like that we hopping on the hype train Ironically this episode isn all that funny and the quote above wa one of the few joke I laughed at It a shame they got Tracy Morgan just to have him on for 5 minute a this spooky brooding devil type Yeah this episode more intent on being dramatic with the classic deal for fame shtick And generally I think it doe a good job Kumail Nanjiana isn the funniest dude but I like his kinda pathetic drama thing goin on And what little we see from other comedian isn that great either but whatever When we see Samir get angry on stage and do an impromptu erasing we feel his frustration This is some genuine shit talking I liked his monologue at the end when he admits that he doesn know why he want fame it go back to this empty vulnerability that sends him off with a shred of sympathy Ladies and gentleman give it up for the Twilight Zone amp x200B Even though the premise of this episode is pretty basic I still intrigued by the idea it going with Because often a a comedian you do share your life with others and thing become le personal especially when you a somebody Like if you really famous and you bitter over an ex you can call them out and it awkward for both of you I guess this isn really a problem in the episode but I like that it grounded And I agree with our pretentious friend David comedy is art When you write a book you can cover thing up use a metaphor or just have different character act out event based on your life experience Peele seems to agree after all he call Samir an artist I feel to some extent this is a minor commentary on Peele own career The line between comedy and horror is thinner than you think And yes this is an hour long episode I haven seen Season 4 of the 60 Zone so I guess I take your word for it that it wa mixed I don think this is necessarily a bad fit for the episode but I am annoyed that it take Samir an extra 10 minute to figure out what going on There a part to all these Twilight Zone episode when something supernatural happens and the main character try to rationalize it or think people are pranking him We call this gag time Then about halfway into the episode thing really kick off with Samir erasing all the jerk from high school we get plenty of reference to character from 60 TZ and the pacing get dialed up to 11 going for some real pacing whiplash I think this whole episode take place in about a month A week I also think that they killed off DiDi too quick and Rena should interrupted him on that day maybe he already listing a bunch of people to try to impress Candy Sure he hesitates a little but it just not enough for the day that can make or break his career Sure seeing him get angry and numb to his murder spree is alright but I think that would been more effective I don think 22 minute is enough for the episode but it could been trimmed down a bit Nothing feel horribly padded I have to admit the part where Rena break up with Samir is weak They trying to be clever by having Rena call him out about how selfish he is for yuckin around while she ha to make end meet a a waitress when in reality we know the real reason he selfish is because he erasing hundred of people for fame It just hard for me to buy the fake reason They try to wave this by saying their relationship isn a good without David existence but what setting this off If she going to stay together with him for 5 year then being late for one day isn going to be the straw that break the camel back Not to mention that his career finally is taking off which mean it only a matter of time until he can start supporting them anyways I wa hoping that this whole erasing people ha consequence thing would be showcased differently like maybe by erasing hundred of bad people the police are more lax or something And Samir is right when he said she wa okay with him erasing people for fame which is honestly a weird thing for her to encourage Maybe she doesn believe he actually erasing people but she seemed pretty on board This also lessens the emotional impact when she criticizes his act later You already knew this It not clear what happens to people after he tell the joke since his joke are just him ribbing on people who don exist anymore Despite his fame nobody ever going to quote or tell one of his joke That another thing with the whole you have to give something up during stand up idea because you don actually give it up Sure it not longer personal and it can mess with your relationship but good joke last a people retell them So everyone just think he funny and nobody know why Weird One of the most surprising complaint I come across is the swearing TV MA is the first thing that pop onto the screen You know what you were getting into I welcome that Peele Twilight Zone ha the privilege of saying more and doing more It wa pretty subdued in Nightmare From 30 000 Feet I actually thought the Oh shit He the pilot wa really funny And when Sanderson say he saw fucked up shit near the beginning that wa a pivotal character defining moment Pretty good swears They used differently in The Comedian Now to those of you complaining about the swears have you never been to a comedy club before I do hope you never check one out because you probably have a heart attack The biggest perpetrator of casual swears who I like to call The Swear Bugbear is DiDi Scott I love DiDi She my favorite Her swears aren forced they integral to her act and her character and make her a great foil for Samir When Samir tell her to take all her advice in an e mail and send it to the bottom of the ocean she retaliates with Yeah hey could you suck my vagina It great Not only doe it contrast these character but it show how they like to banter and it some good early light heartedness When Rena break up with Samir you really believe that DiDi is his only friend left and that give the scene where he era her some weight to it Also when Samir tell DiDi not to say any of the bad word in front of his girlfriend nephew I swear that a jab at you guy And the other guy who joked about censoring c ss Some good premonition here Obviously swearing isn always good and it can get overly vulgar and excessive but I don think we there yet Not even close amp x200B So doe it measure up to the 60 Twilight Zone There a knee jerk no because it hard to make a continuation of something while capturing the heft of being original and groundbreaking And a somebody who watching many 60 Twilight Zones for the first time I might be complaining that some of the older episode are pretty cliche with obvious twist I know that not fair because a lot of them weren cliche at the time but that doesn change my viewing experience But that doesn necessarily make an episode bad either If I can enjoy the ride the destination isn a important And I enjoyed this ride I also don really care about whatever arbitrary standard come with the title The Twilight Zone Good stuff is good y know I liked some of the exaggerated lighting choice that made Eddies look dark and grimy I like Samir and Rena relationship and it wa cute to see them be happy for a short bit even if you know they just included that to fuel the break up later Freaky deaky murderer need love too And I know people were pent up about this series being overly political but this episode wasn political at all sans some bad political joke from our boy Samir Actually it weird that he always open with the 2nd amendment joke is that like the only joke he been telling For 5 year No wonder he so desperate He also made a joke about our president and speaking of which given that he so interested in politics I surprised he not using them for some kind of political gain I doubt he be careful enough to think about the repercussion Now that be an interesting episode in it own right almost like a more upfront The Whole Truth So those are my hot take on the new modern 20 Jordan Peel 3rd Reboot Twilight Zone extravaganza I liked it You can make me un like it Will I review all the new thing Sure but maybe not right away I don really feel like reviewing the Adam Scott airplane podcast gremlin doll spectacular right now so we still keeping our foot firmly rooted in the 60 Even though those have only consisted of 50 of these review so far Hmm This is also where I plug my Wordplay review because I wa hoping more people would read that like one But yeah I feel pretty optimistic about this series and I think it gonna be a blast Also I can tell if the airplane joke wa a reference to the next episode or not but I feel like it totally is And they had the dummy from The Dummy And there were also name reference in Samir contact Aren reference fun,The Groan Zone The Comedian Review
575,FoamCupPhone,TwilightZone,nan,I think in a genius way The Comedian showed that joke on the current political climate his 2nd Amendment and fascist joke are low hanging fruit aren funny and they don cost a Comedian anything
576,XanPerkyCheck,TwilightZone,I have seen both episode that are out now and they appear to have major comedic element Even casting comedy actor like Kumail Nanjiani Adam Scott and Chris Diamantopoulos played Russ Hanneman on Silicon Valley It make a lot of sense that the host is Jordan Peele too lmao,Was the original series also a comedy
577,SnowMann14,TwilightZone,nan,How many episode is CBS putting out this season and doe anyone know an average run time
578,nextzero182,TwilightZone,I happy to offer my service if the mod here are too busy I sure there are others willing to help a well,Why isn there official episode discussion pinned up top It a damn shame this sub isn being moderated properly what a mess
579,alyssainwonderIand,TwilightZone,I am only partially through the second episode a I have to watch while at work but I am so giddy from excitement I often have to pause the episode and scream internally because I am just so damn excited Especially for all of the potential Jordan Peele ha Anyone else binge watch Key amp Peele while waiting for yesterday to come A lot of his style show in those episode Jordan Peele is just a twisted minded a Rod Sterling and I AM SO HAPPY,Peele The Twilight Zone give me butterfly
580,feudalismforthewin,TwilightZone,I a big fan of the original series but never really got into the longer episode in the later season so never actually had seen the Comedian Did anybody see the original one Did you like dislike it Do you feel differently about the newer version,Has anybody seen the original Comedian How did it compare
581,furz23,TwilightZone,to whoever put episode 2 on here god bless,Someone please try to put episode 3 on here when it come out
582,brownbranch76,TwilightZone,Little girl lost the arrival and the howling man all seem to get me every time I watch,Rewatching the original show Which episode creep you out the most
583,GonLA2017,TwilightZone,I finally getting around to watching the new series and on Nightmare at 30 000 Feet the podcast narrator say his name is Rodman Edward Rod Serling first and middle name wa Rodman Edward Thought that wa a nice tribute that u true fan would notice,30 000 Feet tribute to Rod
584,Scarlet-Witch,TwilightZone,There wa a very intentional focus on Peele bracelet a he pick up the recorder at the end of the episode It is the Airborne Proficiency Badge awarded to paratrooper in the US Army This is significant because the original narrator Rod Serling served a a paratrooper in the 11th Airborne Division during WWII,Jordan Peele bracelet easter egg in Nightmare at 30 000 Feet
585,BobHenry05,TwilightZone,Can tell if it lack of organization from the mod or people actually don give a shit about the new show but it kinda strange how there no official discussion thread or stickies Someone suggested maybe we need a new subreddit for the reboot I don know maybe I a minority for enjoying the reboot but I think there should be some kind of sticky or episode discussion on here or a place for fan to enjoy the new show together Love it or hate it this is the new Twilight Zone it ha flaw but I feel there is still a fan base Thoughts,Where is everybody Discussion on Peele Reboot
586,AdmiralDolphin11,TwilightZone,I didn care much for the Comedian and liked 30 000 foot until the last few minute however I continue to believe a reduced 30 minute format help fix many plot issue Even the OG series tends not to easily stream the 45 60 min Season 4 episode an issue they course corrected with in Season 5 I wondered what the TZ community think,30 minute episode are the perfect Twilight Zone format
587,Mohamad979,TwilightZone,I am a big fan of the original show Since were always talking about the best episode I thought it would be fun if we talk about the worst Excludes season 4 a that would be too easy of a target Here are mine that just didn do it for me I sing the body electric The mighty casey Cavander is coming The whole truth How about you guy Intrested to hear what you have to say,We all talk about the best episode from the original series a how about the mediocre or bad episode
588,ajs723,TwilightZone,At face value the theme of this episode seems to be something to the effect of If we don learn and move on from the horror of our past our attempt to be civil will end catastrophically On an individual level that a weird almost nonsensical lesson However taken from the standpoint of US foreign policy it sort of spot on Justin is literally flying from the US to the Middle East a someone who think he know everything that going to happen while also seeing himself a a beacon of civility In the end his idea of civility and his attempt to rescue people who by the way didn need his intervention lead to disaster and make them all violently attack him If we think of Justin a the US and the passenger a the Middle East this is pretty poignant,Is there a deeper political message to Terror at 30 000 Feet
589,justlike12,TwilightZone,Can I go on an English teacher rant for a second I appreciate the intent of changing the pit of man fear in the new intro I all for representation in the Zone But the man fear line never made me feel excluded a a woman because I understood that it is hu man fear Rod is taking about The universality of our common fear and reaction to the show illustration of them is a uniting force I feel like the showrunners missed the point here because by saying one fear it break that communion with sublime transcendent primal terror and make it seem more personal and about individual fear I wished they thought to go with the pit of our fear instead,The pit of one fear
590,cerikn,TwilightZone,nan,Wow this reboot is absolutely terrible How did they manage to screw this up
591,DanceswithTacos_,TwilightZone,SpongeBob doe standup no one think he funny and then when he start making fun of Sandy squirrel he becomes an overnight sensation He loses his friendship with Sandy and in the end learns to make fun of himself The similarity are pretty remarkable http www dailymotion com video x58i8n7,The new episode is literally just the SpongeBob episode Squirrel Jokes
592,VankTar,TwilightZone,The episode ha a hyper focus on technology beginning with the opening shot which show the main character standing in a high tech body scan security machine From there the majority of the technology in the airport is shown to be modern if not a little futuristic The airport ha a spartan distinctly futuristic look and there a deliberate close up on the main character AirPod earbuds However once we enter the plane the majority of the technology we see is archaic by modern standard For an international flight the seat themselves are extremely old fashioned and the main cabin screen which livestream from the cockpit are a design that ha mostly been phased out in favor of seat screen in modern aircraft This technological dissonance build with the introduction of the mp3 player and it pointed necessity of old fashioned headphone But none of this ever go anywhere It doesn appear to factor into the plot or theme of the episode indeed no one even ever really acknowledges the strangeness of the MP3 player and the production design choice are ultimately totally incidental to the twist By the way the twist is It turn out a random insane man wa empowered by a traumatized reporter action while interacting with a magical MP3 player to crash a plane for no reason in such a way that completely destroyed the plane but literally everyone survived and wa dry and they all united to murder the traumatized man and I guess never looked at the MP3 player because it wa taken by a narrating omnipresent being,Nightmare At 30 000 Feet bizarre and pointed use of anachronistic technology in it production design is really distracting and ultimately meaningless to the plot twist
593,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Well is it If it is can there please be at least one special shot only in black and white,Jordan Peele Twilight Zone Is Available Now
594,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,nan,I guess they keep Jordan Peele for a little while but who going to take over hosting for him if something come up
595,Doombuggyman,TwilightZone,Has anyone figured out what make and model they used,The MP3 Player from Nightmare at 30 000 Feet
596,GermanPanda,TwilightZone,these critic and some of the member of this sub have been The comic wa beautifully shot first of all had some clever twist amazing if you compare it to other CBS show edge and at the end of the day debatable take from the show I wa a paid stand up comic for a few year and grinding it out at the open mics night after night and hearing the same political brow beating over and over again did get old and it did come across a hack almost every time Was that the message or wa the message that audience are stupid and mostly they don want to learn they just want to see you suffer and in return they will laugh and praise you I dunno I just woke up and it wa the first thing on my mind and I can wait to watch more Peele hit me right in the heart with this first episode and I beyond excited for the rest of the season,Watched the first episode and what a pretentious mess
597,HJuanZeeJuan,TwilightZone,Just found out about the remake and wa massively excited Suffice to say 15 minute in i got bored and switched it off This definitely isnt the twilight zone No narrator huge 1 hour episode that take away from the core idea of the original Super interested to see what others think,Something about this doesn rub me the right way
598,ForgetfulLucy28,TwilightZone,Because after these episode and Us I starting to think Get Out wa a fluke Or just exceptional because he had more time to write it,How much input doe Jordan Peele actually have
599,trover2345325,TwilightZone,This is just an opinion but have you wondered why the twilight zone 2019 reboot ha to be TV MA Maybe the reason is because it should not only match up with the current anthology series that aim for a mature audience but also cover political issue and current social issue in our world that are controversial especially the darker part of humankind similar to the original twilight zone,Why the 2019 twilight zone ha to be TV MA
600,luigirools,TwilightZone,TL DR I didn care for it at all Just about everything decision in the production felt off to me and I very disappointed Let me start by saying I wa really hoping to enjoy this a lot I a huge fan of the original series and caught a few here and there very late in the evening when I slept over my Grandma house Last year I decided to finally take the plunge and watch each episode and while not everyone wa a winner I estimate 5 10 perhaps aren very good but by and large the series is an absolute classic and a must watch for fan who are interested in science fiction Especially if you like looking at the story from their place in history and the influence they had in pop culture I remember growing up hearing about The Twilight Zone in song lyric and cartoon metaphor in day to day language the show wa and still is pretty inescapable in some capacity With all that being said it an understatement to say that I wa excited for a Brand New stylish series for my generation that paid homage and nodded liberally to the original series Now I really think that I may have been too excited a I often am for new thing This often lead me to big disappointment but I keep holding on and hoping for something great Jordan Peele reboot of the series start off with a very rocky episode that really make me hesitant to even continue Just about everything that I don like about newer medium is present here Bland and boring visuals underwhelming writing unlikable character and a overly drawn out runtime 1 Bland and Boring Visuals Overall I just think that the visual style is rather boring The color palatte is drab and muted just like most everything else today The camera work is creative in a few place but for the most part wa shot like it wa any other show I wa expecting or rather hoping the show to have more flair or at least to have it own unique visual style It not amateur or anything but it didn stand out or excite me in any way I really wish a show like this would take the opportunity to really go crazy with vibrant color and nonstandard camera angle They could use element like those to visually tell the story without the need for verbose dialogue 2 Underwhelming Writing Unlikable Characters The writing in this episode wa all over the place The dialogue never felt natural like all the character are reciting from a script a bad script It really felt forced most of the time I kept thinking to myself this is not how people talk Usually this would not bug me a much but they are obviously going for a real world tone and that clash with the dialogue that try too hard to sound hip with new expression instead of just sounding like normal people It really creates this odd disconnect with the world it creates and it just ended up feeling really forced That brings me to my next problem the cursing Now I not a prude at all I love raunchy stuff when it fit but the constant swearing doe not fit at all If I wanted to hear people swear THAT much I would have watched a Rob Zombie film That not a knock at Zombie at all I love his work and all of his movie are very entertaining in those story the raunchy dialogue work a lot better than it doe here But I will say that the character in Rob Zombie film are every bit a unlikable a the character in this episode I not sure if that wa the intention to have no relatable character but none of the character had any redeeming quality Every last one wa mean spirited and it lessened the impact of the story and it also deadened the asserted moral I not even sure at this point that there wa a moral to this story but it sort of seems like there wa one It just confusing and the narrative wa all over the place It just really reminds you of how the original series didn need to swear to get the story across The story we played straight and handled with a lot of class and all of that wa missing here I really think that is the single biggest factor that detracts from the episode there wasn any class at all Just clunky and overly raunchy dialogue not to mention the very unlikable character It all just feel so mean spirited and unnecassary 3 Overly Drawn Out Runtime This one is the problem I have the least to say about but it only exacerbates the previous problem I mentioned The runtime is just too darn long Most of the runtime is rather boring to look at and not fun to listen to The story isn a complex one at all and could have been told in a much shorter time I don know why film and television are trending toward stretching out the runtime but I really don like it Most of the time the film or show isn made any better with the inclusion of double the runtime and oftentimes it just get very tedious and boring to slog through something for that long Every Marvel movie that coming out is at least 2 or 2 and a half hour long and the newest upcoming film in the series Avengers Endgame is a staggering 3 hour long Why I get really bored sitting through anything for that length of time Typically it isn filled with anymore meat just more fluff for whatever reason and that is definitely the case for this episode a well I really wish these sort of show and movie would cut off the fat and just get to the point Final Thoughts Yeah this episode wasn my cup of tea and I am very disappointed about that I wa really hoping for a respectful insightful and visually engaging Twilight Zone reboot but what I ended up seeing wa completely a different product I will admit I am very disinterested to even continue on with the series At this point I much rather just continue to watch the remaining few episode of the original series and the first two revival that I haven seen yet Yet I not wanting to completely throw out the towel yet Many people say the first episode is a heck of a stinker but go on to praise the second much more highly I still not completely sold from the preview I seen it just doesn look any better The ONLY thing I think they nailed wa the music It PERFECT The opening and closing rendition of the original and the cue inspired by the original are really fun and I like to listen to the music on it own on Spotify or something Jordan Peele himself is passable a a host he isn captivating or anything but he is a highlight for the episode that for sure Overall this episode wa about a deep a a puddle and about a interesting to look at a one too but I will admit that that would be an insult to puddle There are some good bit but it mostly surrounded by bitter and unsavory chunk that left a bad taste in my mouth Please feel free to leave a comment and discus some counter point or addition you like to add to my review I always willing to hear differing opinion and I hoping for some open communication about how everyone felt about the episode,Episode 1 The Comedian My Review

611,Mohamad979,TwilightZone,Since the new reboot dropped this sub ha been split I dont think it right that someone be downvoted to oblivion for their opinion whether they like the new show or not Yes some people have been taking it a bit too far calling the new show absolute garbage and stuff and those downvotes are honestly deserved But some people myself included have been downvoted for stating why they didnt really like the new show and giving a honest opinion Were all civilized people here and I think it would be more beneficial if we discussed why or why we didnt like the new show instead of just causing more division,Guys I think it time we address this issue
612,Holden_D_Znuts,TwilightZone,nan,Is it bad that The Comedian is a better adaption of Death Note than the Netflix film

616,Comedyfish_reddit,TwilightZone,removed,Was the comedian in The Comedian supposed to be funny
617,BobNeilandVan,TwilightZone,The first 2 episode in my opinion weren very good episode but the production quality acting and writing wa all solid which give me reason to believe that future episode in this reboot might be very good,I am still greatly looking forward to the rest of the season of this show
618,UsefulCamel,TwilightZone,Yes we all want to watch all of them right now because impatience But do we see the sense of community and discussion we building in this sub by going all at the same pace Rather than one person accidentally spoiling episode 6 and one person hating 4 while you still on episode 3 we all watching a they go along and really breaking down each episode piece by piece Some like them some hate them but at least we discussing them It good to be patient The payoff is normally better,To the people complaining about them not releasing all the episode at once

621,Claymationdude07,TwilightZone,I wa wondering why every single person on the plane survived the crash and sure it work for the poetic ending when they all massacre the main guy But then I thought about car crash Experts always say it better to get in a car crash where you don know it coming so your body is limp you aren trying to brace yourself for the impact Everyone on the plane wa put to sleep so their body would be lifeless in the crash I also tend to believe that once our protagonist realizes the plain is going down remove his oxygen mask and get knocked out a well so he wouldn have to live through the crash that why he just wake up on the beach I would Of course this doesn explain why nobody even ha a scratch on them or why they didn drown just an interesting thought,Spoiler I have an explanation for part of the ending of 30 000 foot
622,Goose21995,TwilightZone,Its absolutely redicules how many AMAZING tv show we are loosing because of corporate greed Regardless if you like it or not the new T Z just started so it got to catch it footing and be a little broader to attract a good audience then you can judge it when it in it prime and they have a little more creative freedom Give it a chance But there wont be a chance becase this shit gonna flop Not because it bad but because these streaming service have this bright idea to hold show hostage on their shitty streaming platform which nobody is going to pay for just for one show then it inevitably get cancelled Starz did that with ash v evil dead and most ppl didnt even know it existed But now that it on Netflix it actually gaining traction and a cult following too bad it already gone Disney is trying to pull this shit with the netflix marvel show Thats why they canned the punisher and jessica jones because thwy want future marvel show in their disney streaming garbage Only hope would be if all the episode came put at once so people could do a free trial watch it and convince themselves it worth it But NOBODY is going to pay 20 a month for a show that might take up to 4 month of payment just to watch one goddamn season No thank you And thanks for utterly destroying what ive been hoping for since i wa a kid Thanks a bunch Fucking corporate coward Always scared to take a risk,CBS is dooming the future of this show

628,justanothernakedred,TwilightZone,Whilst I haven done a very deep dive yet I have yet to see many interesting interpretation of what the first couple of episode are about I seen a couple of people complain that they feel shirked by the feeling of a left wing agenda but I personally didn feel this and wonder if this is down to Samir Second Ammendment joke To me the first episode felt like an indictment of cancel culture Samir naming and shaming of his subject cause their very existence to be entirely wiped out along with any impact they have had on the world Whilst his first chosen subject have done grave terrible act such a drink driving and paedophilia the crime quickly slip into a grey area with his subject guilt being more questionable each time To me Samir feel like the left wing medium and by the end we come to realise that he is looking for anyone to talk about just to feed his hungry audience and he is definitely not the good guy The second episode message is le overt to me but something about an investigation ultimately over nothing and involving a Russian red herring definitely feel on the nose with regard to the Mueller investigation and the left general paranoia over Trump Perhaps more on the nose is the protagonist article being called the end of civility At least in my own interpretation the overall usability message so far is similar to that of Peele recent movie The Twilight Zone feel like it is asking the left to scrutinize itself I love it,The socio political commentary of the first couple of episode

633,nesquik1030,TwilightZone,I just watched episode 1 and 2 of the new Twilight Zone and I found them to be very compelling portrayal of narcissism http en wikipedia org wiki Narcissism and psychosis http en wikipedia org wiki Psychosis and I excited to see the series take a deeper dive into abnormal psychology http en wikipedia org wiki Abnormal_psychology I familiar with the original series and watched my share of Black Mirror and Electric Dreams but I really enjoying the tone of the storytelling in this modern iteration continuation of the classic beloved series Jordan narration and signature personality with his history in the world of comedy and horror are a major driving factor in building this universe of entirely believable deeply empathetic experience of absurdist terror that are great metaphor for what happens when one thought drive their action while simultaneously consuming their entire personal being With each episode I feel that I am right there with the character figuring out frankly what the fuck is going on This series ha a lot of watch potential and after a watch of the first episode I eager to pick up on more detail in the second and eventually the rest of the series Some were complaining about the pacing of the Ep1 but I found it only drew me deeper into the character His repetition of material failing to feed his insatiable hunt for attention and recognition lead him to explore a new person to go after for material at their expense and eventually his own psychopathy http en wikipedia org wiki Psychopathy at the same time it build u the audience inevitable thirst for fresh blood reference intended a 4th wall break that I noticed after reading comment after my second viewing In a way the impatience and high expectation of the audience u and the one in the episode itself are fully acknowledged within the episode writing So far I find the show to be a masterpiece and I look forward to seeing the rest of it,THEMATIC SPOLIERS The Twilight Zone is taking u on an exploratory journey through different state of mental health
634,Kazman2007,TwilightZone,Joe and Justin are the same person In a Fight Club reference no one else actually interacts with Joe At the end of the episode he clearly becomes the one to take over the plane and is shown on the camera to everyone else If all the passenger saw this why would they think Justin brought the plane down No one saw him give the cockpit entry code to Joe The only way that the passenger would have thought Justin crashed the plane is if it wa actually him on the camera Also the second part of the podcast make no mention of Joe despite saying that all passenger had been accounted for except Justin If Joe wa alive surely the passenger would have either killed him or outed him to the public,THEORY Nightmare at 30 000 Feet Spoilers

637,oceaneyed5,TwilightZone,nan,Do I need to watch the older twilight zone to understand the new one or is this just a reboot
638,VankTar,TwilightZone,The political message of this episode isn concise enough to make sense to me Free of the comedy context it seems to be really mostly about public shaming and how toxic and damaging it is to everyone involved even if someone deserves it This crescendo when Samir literally us the word Me Too to erase someone who doesn deserve to be erased and derails his wife life by eradicating one of her biggest supporter and mentor But the show doesn really acknowledge that It sort of is just like poor Samir he a piece of shit now he gone He gave up too much of himself I seen a lot of analytical and intellectual read of these new Twilight Zone episode but all of them require big reach to make them work in the thin context of what actually presented There no there there,The Comedian message about public shaming is incoherent and doesn come together in a meaningful way

640,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Wish for them I can bring you Scotland Yard the Federal Bureau of Investigation or every Bobby in the city of London Is it the police you want Genie amp x200B Watching medium outside of it historical context is often tricky Is it fair to judge a piece of art for being cliche if it pioneered that cliche How much bearing should that have on my opinion I can sit here and pretend like it all well and good and not something I seen a million time before but that disingenuous Now when I put on my reviewer hat I ought to be understanding of context but that easier said than done Genies Jinn have been around for millennium They intelligent have crazy power and look real weird They can be your angle or yuor devil They basically a unique and varied a human but like superhumans And a we all know human need to be kept on a leash hence the whole bottle thing I think Solomon had like hundred of bottle in his genie cellar We can credit a lot of how we the west see genie to Arabian Nights Now this episode seems to mostly be concerned with juxtaposing the genie with a fairly typical relatable couple writhing in debt I hold that this wasn an original idea even for it time but it certainly paved the way for many bottle to come From primordial superhumans to Will Smith this is another tale of another genie and the people he messing with And yes it in the Twilight Zone amp x200B Arthur Castle ha to be like the dumbest guy ever Top 10 Dumbest Twilight Zone Protags coming soon to a sub near you Head of a foreign country can be voted out of office within this century Dude aren you Jewish I don think it confirmed whether the character is Jewish but Luther Adler is and he doe have a nice kvetch to his voice Even if I hadn seen that Futurama parody this is beyond predictable I do think that if his character is Jewish it add more horror to the twist but it also make him like really really dumb I get he all caught up on the wish train but he literally trying to make a wish that doesn have consequence when the most obvious of all consequence is right under his nose in a toothbrush mustache And apparently Adler played Hitler twice before this so it might even be an in joke It a strong twist in theory but it sheer obviousness ha it fall flat He totally deserves Genie evil laughter Also it clever that the genie lamp subbed in for the cyanide bottle even though it historically inaccurate That the least of this episode problem I like that Arthur and Edna Castle are genuinely good people Usually the way these story play out is that the wishmaker or wishee is greedy and deserves to be punished for their selfish desire They get carried away but the beginning establishes that they good people who are just trying to get by I don blame them for wishing for a million dollar which would go for 8 million today or the power thing Edna doe feel a little superfluous in all this Arthur doe all the wishing She basically just there to doubt Arthur I guess technically Arthur owns the bottle but still I always appreciated the Twilight Zone minimalism including casting but to have a character that basically doe nothing in an episode with 3 major character is disappointing But enough negativity Arthur generosity to Mrs Gumley is heartwarming and it a little weird that he get punished for this Wait no he doesn Mental scar notwithstanding In fact he gain something he get 5 buck out of the deal and all of his poor friend get bundle of money I know he reset everything but the glass wasn reset until he bumped into it You could suppose that all the money they donated will get magicked away somehow but they end up appreciating what little they have and it still a happy ending at least I also like the antique shop given how minimal the setting usually are especially in the next episode it nice to see a bunch of ornate statue and ceramic and such I think I saw the Holy Grail somewhere It also cement the irony of being surrounded by this extravagant stuff while being on the verge of bankruptcy Also apparently some of the music here is used from What You Need Nice touch I love Joseph Ruskin in this He honestly make the episode I like that the smoke coming out of the bottle at first is implied to be from Genie because he sure drag that cig throughout the entire episode He come off a a subdued salesman like someone who act formal with a vague hint of the sinister You can see a glimmer of amusement a he watch the Castles debate over what to wish for Look at how he beam when Arthur brings up power He know he got a couple of fly in his jaw but he savor every moment before his mouth snap shut His magnanimous act is so convincing that you start to wonder if he genuinely warning them about the inevitable consequence of magic that is until his face freeze in laughter at Arthur boneheaded wish Luther Adler ha a decent performance a well if not a bit hammy The glass wish never backfire Maybe it because it so simple and innocuous but that interesting right It implies that maybe Genie isn a evil a we thought and he be more than happy to grant small meager wish Or maybe he luring them into a false sense of security Oh well it basically just a test wish anyways Guess that why they get 4 It fun that they had a test wish for that suspension of disbelief and the gag time wa pretty short And I guess Genie glass fixing ability foreshadow him fixing his bottle a if that wa something we needed to see amp x200B The worst thing about this episode is that it is predictable a all get out It play out exactly how you expect these wish episode to go with little variation or subversion The twist are predictable too Even if it wa more original in it day I still feel it a weaker episode overall Maybe show it to somebody who literally never seen this type of story ever The protagonist are likable enough and Ruskin performance should keep you entertained Contemporary cultural context doe put a damper on this one a it doe to many classic episode but this is one bottle I could do without I have a feeling there be a lot of review like this so I suppose my wish of peeking at the other side ha been granted,The Groan Zone

658,larosha1,TwilightZone,I just finished an anthology of all the short story that were adapted by Serling Made me buy a collection of Richard Matheson story,The Short Stories
659,fuzzycorona,TwilightZone,Something I kinda love about the original Twilight Zone is just how early 60 it is That not to say that the episode aren relateable or creepy or poignant now but it really cool how clear it is that this show wa made at a time when the world wa still recovering from the Second World War there were lot of people who were still alive who come to America in the immigrant wave of the late 19th early 20th century everyone wa constantly terrified of nuclear war and people still thought the Wild West wa a cool and fun setting Nothing give me the same sense of history not even other old sci fi show Both the original Star Trek and Classic Doctor Who have socio political commentary don let anyone tell you otherwise but their protagonist are people who go to different place and have adventure not various ordinary people who wind up in various fucked up circumstance I really hope that Jordan Peele version of The Twilight Zone is able to stand the test of time and give people the same sense when they watch it 50 or 60 year from now This is why I don think people should worry about making science fiction timeless As the decade pas it turn into a cool snapshot of a time in history and or take on new and possibly different resonance,The Twilight Zone and History

662,electricmastro,TwilightZone,I felt that Mr Garrity and the Graves could have gone farther with the idea of a traveling salesman who unknowingly brings up zombie from their graf in the Old West I think it had more potential for there to be comedy terror and action from people fighting off against a horde of zombie,What episode didn use their idea to their full potential

664,JaxtellerMC,TwilightZone,Do we have any clue a to who is picking up the show overseas I assumed Netflix would take over like they did with the Star Trek show but there ha been zero announcement it a if we basically don exist,CBS The Twilight Zone for folk overseas
665,nulldrone,TwilightZone,I dropping the Serling shtick I can keep it up Basically the idea is that I saw some episode of The Twilight Zone a a child and I want to revisit it It an iconic piece of television and I like that it episodic so I can skip around I wa a dumb kid One for the Angels suck It not even scary so I find something new even in rewatches Also I looked up all the twist on Wikipedia because I wa a dumb kid Hopefully those stay buried I mostly be looking at the original 60 series but never say never It worth mentioning I don have Season 4 so we save our Jess Belles and Printer Devils for later Browsing through the catalog one of the episode that made a huge impression on me wa Perchance to Dream I remember it being terrifying and it had a cat in it which is always good But this cat out of the bag and diving foot first into the Twilight Zone amp x200B It still spooky Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statue and all that Even when people say they silly and cheesy I can help getting spooked But most of the spook come from Robert Florey directing I have to get back to some of his other episode According to Charles Beaumont Florey strove for quality and this episode might have been the most expensive MGM feature It show Right at the beginning we trail along a low angle shot of a building making it look powerful and imposing After that we cut between Edward Hall weary face and people cycling in and out of the building emphasizing how nerve wracking such a trivial task is for him It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity like an opener should With how quick these cut are I start to feel dizzy there a distinct sense of vertigo here In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written story are capable of conveying more information than television That obviously not true and this episode serf a a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition movement and sound Granted I haven read Beaumont original story but I can stress enough how great Florey directing is here This episode play with fear and paranoia and take it sweet time to build up to Hall serialized nightmare The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it shot really make me anxious Just like the beginning we flash between Hall panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object you gotta go back and wonder what Hall wa seeing in the building and people going through it Seeing the infamous eye for the first time isn even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drive my heart rate up and the aftermath feel like an afterthought Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can help it and it consequence are all too real whether a a car crash or death itself This idea continues a we enter Hall dream In a way a dream is just a form of Hall imagination only stronger and harder to escape When he talk to Maya for the first time she point out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it only a dream not realizing how much a dream can affect him It not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thought without realizing how they being consumed or how others can wave off one paranoid thought a something you can just think away Maya us this to her advantage it only a dream so why not indulge a little Not only into Hall fear but also into the thrill of a funhouse a rollercoaster or even a courtesan Maya represents Hall indulgence whether it into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear view mirror An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence The idea isn that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought The power of the mind is terrifying A low key fear of mine is Maya freakin laughter It there at the beginning of Hall dream it there a Hall get spooked by Maya and it there a Hall enters and exit the funhouse Juxtaposing laughter with dark unsettling imagery evokes not only that someone know something you don but also that they delight in your disorientation amp x200B Now it time to talk about my least favorite part of the episode the twist This episode didn happen Hall died 3 minute into the episode just after he entered Dr Rathmann office It a real Playtest There always something that bother me about these kind of twist it cheapens the episode a bit basically admitting to the audience that this wa all a fat load of nothing This episode fare better than most because thematically it deeply ingrained in dream a a stronger vehicle of the imagination Although Hall official cause of death is probably a heart attack we see that in his mind he commits suicide he can handle the idea that Maya ha followed him to this safe space and fear that she going to kill him so he end up doing it for her So what my beef with the twist So the idea is that Hall imagination end up consuming him Hall see someone who look like Maya and it scare him so much that he jump out the window But when this is revealed to be a dream something is lost It not like in Twenty Two where Liz experience the terror of seeing her dream play out in real life it would work if that were the case because Hall paranoid dream create dissonance with reality the painting isn really moving There nobody in the backseat Hall imagination is superseding reality With the twist Hall imagination is only superseding his imagination He imagined this scenario where the receptionist look like Maya and it too much for him Of course the ending reveals that the IRL receptionist Miss Thomas bear a striking resemblance to Maya but that practically irrelevant His dream is only referencing itself There no reality to ground it Who to say that both Maya appearance in the dream within a dream and the psychiatrist dream aren both based off of Miss Thomas If Shadow Play is anything to go off of Maya appearance might change with every dream Her piercing eye are her main feature And you could argue that the shock of seeing Maya is what drove his heart over the edge in real life but they barely feel connected The powerful fear of becoming disconnected with reality is lost completely because dreaming is a normal commonplace thing you not disconnecting from reality I actually like the set up Hall dream are affecting him IRL from the start not in some tenuous physiological connection but because they forcing him to stay awake Some have said that this is a more realistic episode but this is the part that swerve into fantasy the idea that the dream affected him so much it killed him You die in a dream you die in real life So why even have the twist Some say that Beaumont is overly indulgent in twist and I can kinda see that it a little cheesy in Person or Persons Unknown and A Nice Place to Visit but we have other example like Shadow Play and Long Live Walter Jameson that don really have twist though the twist to the latter is pretty weak The main two aspect of this twist are the idea of imagination consuming Hall life and the dissonance between reality and imagination What better way to show how powerful Hall imagination ha become by putting him fully into it through a dream and having that kill him Maybe I would liked it more if he just had vivid hallucination and ran around completely disorientated But the second part is the crux of the twist in his dream Hall dy violently and of his own accord he jump out of a window signifying his heart giving out But he dy peacefully in real life without nobody realizing the trauma he gone through On the one hand I like that the Twilight Zone is acknowledging that people see think and feel thing differently and want u to empathize more with others but this theme isn developed well enough I don hate the twist but I think it kind of lame and I wouldn go to it birthday party I don always like the subtle touch but the way it used here is decent just not in a way I can really get behind And I totally biased against this genre of twist so if you made it this far take this salt with a grain of twist Writing this out make me appreciate the twist more amp x200B Also John Larch who played Mr Fremont in It a Good Life come back front a Elliott Rathmann the psychiatrist Total coincidence I like him a lot better here a this wry understated psychiatrist that crack joke about not looking like Freud It interesting that he offer Hall a smoke a even then the health effect are known of course this is all Hall dream so we don actually know anything about the real Rathmann This wa probably an excuse to get him towards the window In fact what little we see of Rathmann show him a a more concerned active figure maybe Hall think of him a this droll character to help calm him down When Hall is explaining his strong imagination with every one of Rathmann reassurance Hall immediately responds with I know At no point doe Rathmann challenge Hall or give him any new information Hall is talking to himself And the smoke end up paralleling Maya giving him a light in his dream signifying the false sense of calm preluding the very real danger he in Clever Hall end up being half right in his paranoia falling asleep doe end up killing him but not in the way he expected He doesn end up dreaming in serial back to the carnival but rather someplace a safe and prosaic a a psychiatrist office It one thing to find something spooky in a spooky carnival but in an ordinary office Shock city Overall this is the kind of episode where you have to be right there with the protagonist to really enjoy it If you aren relating to Hall you could easily see this episode a slowly paced and kind of boring He loses me a little near the end but this is easily one of the better psychological thriller episode of the Twilight Zone And I know nobody will share my gripe with the twist so all the more reason to check it out This is a dream you won want to wake up from Also I forgot to talk about Richard Conte and Suzanne Lloyd performance They were good I liked their chemistry,The Groan Zone Perchance to Dream Review

667,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,Am I missing something Did we not learn anything from season four Episodes like Thirty Fathom Grave and The Parallel would be classic at twenty four minute the original and preferable length of a TZ episode,So every episode of Peele Twilight Zone is going to be an hour long
668,7deadlycinderella,TwilightZone,It definitely lacked the style of the 60 version and sorely missed Rod Serling but I thought it had a number of extremely classic episode too A Matter of Minutes Paladin of the Lost Hour A Small Talent for War I of Newton Nightcrawlers I think I of Newton is my favorite,Any other fan of the 80 version around here
669,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,I start this one off with one of my own The Fugitive What the hell kind of an episode wa that I know it not mentioned what happened to her parent but that neither here nor there The magician and the disabled girl living with her abusive aunt Obviously her parent are dead and the toy and stuffed animal are hers she moved from her home after her aunt got custody when they died and people come to arrest him even though it not illegal to show kid magic trick then it turn out that the magician wa really a king and the policeman were his entourage Just a weirdly written not well thought out episode at all At the end he turn himself into the girl identical twin sister just so he won have to separate from her and then the Magician and the girl leave an alien photo for the aunt to find but it actually a photo of a teenage heartthrob from the 1950 Where wa the logic in the whole thing from beginning to end,Not bad or scary but what are some of the most poorly written episode ever

677,Typical_Humanoid,TwilightZone,Don get me wrong I think it a top tier episode but I try to covertly distract people from looking at the title whenever I show them the episode because Earth is what will inevitably come to mind when you hear this phrase and that not what you want to draw attention to a far a this story go But I actually didn catch on my first time and wa stupefied by the twist frankly so I torn if I overthinking this or not,Does anybody else think Third From The Sun title is a bit too spoilery for comfort
678,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Well isn it I mean just look at the evidence 1 Something deadly happens to the main character Hyder Simpson within the first few minute of this episode he drowned in a lake running after his dog 2 He return the next morning and realizes that nobody talking to him He of course think he being ignored and doesn clue in it because the living and dead aren meant to interact they can see or hear one another and have no clue that he there 3 He see the people digging a grave for his dog Rip RIP Rest In Peace He try to talk to them and later shoot them what would have happened if he pulled the trigger Would just air and dust dissipate and nothing else Or would have forfeited his chance for heaven altogether a he wa trying to kill people thou shalt not kill remember 4 He try several time to talk to his wife to no avail It turn out Hyder Simpson and Rip are no longer alive at the very end and unable to go back to the land of the living 5 Hyder follows the pall bearer bearing a coffin asking who in it but now he mostly talking to his dog Instead of finding the cemetery he find the other gate 6 Hyder Simpson and his dog Rip died during the night but neither know it 7 The episode end with Hyder Simpson walking his dog up to heaven with him finally at peace having accepted that it is what it is and he is dead and finished with life on earth He at peace and acceptance amp x200B In short Dr Malcolm Crow from The Sixth Sense went through all of these same situation since the start of the movie The Sixth Sense I know M Knight admitted that The Sixth Sense wasn even his own idea he stole the inspiration from Are You Afraid Of The Dark Dream Girl but yes the side by side comparison is uncanny and it fit with only a few minor infraction Instead of almost attempting to shoot people Dr Malcolm Crow actually break the glass on the door of his wife jewelry store Instead of seeing people digging a grave and grabbing coffin Dr Crow and Cole attend someone funeral together And Dr Crow had no pet And it is possible that Rip The Dog no offense to Cole The Kid since Cole could see ghost and dead people all the time and knew Dr Crow wa dead all along through a variety of scene without dialogue even though Dr Crow didn know he wa dead and it turned out it wa Cole mission to help Dr Crow move onto the other side with ease Similarly Rip could see right through the phony gate and Hyder didn want to separate from him and if he did The Late Hyder Simpson would have ended up in hell instead of heaven and that wa Rip Mission but then again Cole had a pet dog of his own named Sebastian who seemed to have a sixth sense with haunted apartment a well I think that evidence is concrete What do you all think,The Hunt Is that plot the exact same a The Sixth Sense or What
679,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,nan,Showdown with Rance McGraw Waste Of time
680,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,nan,Was it ever explained why the land in Elegy had two sun
681,aTVisAthingTOwatch,TwilightZone,Is it just me or is this episode overrated I not saying it wa bad for it time but to me it just doesn hold up very well The acting is pretty exaggerated and the scene without any music are just absolutely cringy This is just my opinion though would love to know your guy thought,The Invaders
682,adamswebster,TwilightZone,So the first episode wa a guy loosing it on a plane when he see a gremlin thing on the wing This one didn really mess with me but I think it would be fun to watch The second wa this dream eater reaper thing that would come out of the wall and kill you in your sleep this one really got to me a a kid and I had nightmare for year The last one is about people who are trapped in a bin of some kind of bin and it end with them turning into toy or were toy all along I don remember Any help would be greatly appreciated,I think I watched some episode a a kid and wa wondering if someone could tell me witch they were
683,aTVisAthingTOwatch,TwilightZone,Just watched the ICE AGE episode and it seemed very reminescent of Miniature I also love how each episode is it own unique story you can just tell this show got it inspiration from Twilight Zone Plus the animation in it is just over the top I wa pretty amazed What do you guy think about it,LOVE DEATH ROBOTS on Netflix is great
684,borbafett1,TwilightZone,nan,I tired Off to bed Someone pick an episode for me to watch in bed Ready go
685,borbafett1,TwilightZone,Was how old the character in the episode wa according to Rod narration 9 time out of 10 it so and so mid 30 when clearly the actor or actress is at least 50 It probably safe to assume Serling wrote the age of each character in the script but it baffling why he wouldn change that line based on how old the actor wa Anyway The whole series and almost every episode is still at 10 10 Can wait for April 1,The one thing about The Twilight Zone I always felt wa mildly infuriating a bit
686,Mystery-time-lady,TwilightZone,I think it a toss up between time enough at last because I really connected with him and he didn deserve that but the second one would have to be kick the can the ending once again get me I value friendship and the event of being left behind really packed a punch which episode got your eye tearing up,What do you think are the saddest episode of the classic era
687,Gaming-Atlas,TwilightZone,nan,Can someone please help me pick a random episode to watch
688,Secular-By-Nature,TwilightZone,In this episode an old man who is awaiting his death portrayed loosely a a vampire or is he just telling the kid that befriends a young boy whose family would later mutate into monster and kill the man I looked all over the internet for analysis of this episode to no avail but my take is that it portraying how old people are seen a a burden leech vampire to some people and many are just waiting to die while the family who seems to love them in the daytime are actually the same people who will check them into a dark dreary nursing home to die which is why the people are equated with monster who kill the old man Thoughts,The Twilight Zone 1985 S01E15 Monsters thought
689,PaperMachetedHeart,TwilightZone,This episode really get under my skin They had a pretty solid plan However I always wondered why De Cruz eliminated their sole form of transportation by not only killing Brooks but also jumping out of the car only for it to go off a cliff and essentially become totalled I understand his animosity towards Brooks and how he wanted to kill him but why also ruin the car in the process Watching them trek through the blazing California desert with little water supply is so daunting and very painful The whole episode just dragged on Thoughts anyone,The Rip Van Winkle Caper
690,ryanseanoreilly,TwilightZone,removed,Podcast Review of story by Charles Beaumont
691,neads1,TwilightZone,Doing a marathon here of the original series This one had me gripped I know it a TV show yadda yadda but watching John Denver play a great character rubbishing superstition only to be scared out his wit and ultimately facing his doom His journey through the park reminds me how I felt having to do it late at night so many time myself Paranoia such a bitch Amazing episode definitely one of my favourite,The Jungle S3 ep 12
692,Ethan_ML10,TwilightZone,I didn really like the kick the can one,Whats your least favorite episode of the original series
693,TwiliSidon360,TwilightZone,removed,I Midna
694,nulldrone,TwilightZone,Picture this if you will a young lad in his 20 who saw brief flash of a zone at a young age Scarred for life he now digging through the past and hit the bedrock known a The Twilight Zone And now I guess he go to a lab and analyzes the mineral composition or whatever that is this review And I called it The Groan Zone What the heck is wrong with me Enjoy amp x200B I love Anthony Freemont I think he a real fascinating character A lot of people write him off a the spoiled godlike dictator that everyone in Peaksville fear but I don think that totally fair In Jerome Bixby original story we get to see more into Anthony mind a watcher of art we have some level of mind reading too Sometimes he go into the grove and play with the animal bringing them nest and water and such At one point he cornfield murder a sleek furry thing ferret for thinking about attacking another li l critter It not out of malice Anthony just doesn realize that animal need to eat and they can just expect him to materialize soy dog or whatever Even when he force a rat to eat itself that only because Aunt Amy doesn like rat in the basement and he trying to do her a favor He probably doesn even realize he broke her brain We see some of this in Serling adaptation a well It clear he framed more a a villain in the Twilight Zone to bump up that spook factor Literally the first thing we learn about Anthony is that he a monster But there still a strange childishness to everything he doe that lends a very particular brand of charm He make a gopher with three head and other funny animal On television night he ha this little plastic dinosaur movie with great effect too if Odyssey of Flight 33 is anything to go off of He doing the whole town a huge favor by making TV in a place without electricity And at some point he wonder why other kid won play with him It oddly isolating having everybody constantly praise you and tell you how great everything is Basically what I getting at is that Anthony is a child He might be an omniscient omnipotent little mutant but he still a child darn it In the original story the fear doesn just come from oh no he cornfield me so much a i don know what he do Even with good intention he doesn understand the full extent of his power and how they affect people He like Bill Soames But Bill dog doesn like him so he just cornfield it And given how everyone always enabling him this is unlikely to change Rod point out one particular thing of note in the intro he can feel every emotion The reason why he so nice to the grove animal in the story is because it make them feel good which make him feel good You could even say he an empath I suspect he doesn feel a lot of genuine joy from people and ha grown to expect this good fakey joy He might realize that something not quite right but they seem happy and everyone reassures him how good he being so he just roll with it That also why when he detects negative emotion he hone in on those and feel them strongly even more so since everyone trying to be happy all the time I really gotta hand it to Bill Mumy he doe a great job of creating this matter of fact god emperor vibe Given how most child actor are he go above and beyond to make Anthony feel smug and callous but in a way you kind of like He also ha that thosuand yard stare that add to the spook factor He really make the episode I glad he eventually got to go into space and build robot or whatever None of the other actor were terribly impressive mostly because they stuck on that hivemind of fear and fake smile The only other character with any semblance of personality are Aunt Amy and Dan Hollis Amy is a living example of how Anthony could mess up anyone even his own family It never clarified what he did to her but a vacant stare is brought up so you get the gist That might be why she seems le terrified of Anthony having the audacity to complain about the heat During Dan speech she reach ever so slightly for a poker implying she wa thinking of stabbing the little brat but chickened out Even though she not quite right she express her resentment toward Anthony a little more bluntly Also the snow at the end is a big screw you to her having commented on the weather earlier Dan the guy who stand up to tyranny and get gunned down immediately He seems petulant in a it my party i cry if i want to kind of way but the booze doesn help On one hand it like c mon bro you can wait till you get home you been living under this god for like six year what an hour or two but don forget they live in a subsistence economy In the story it wa clear that everyone traded thing around and I don think gramophone grow on tree It implied that they all die eventually unless Anthony materializes some food probably candy or something and they can enjoy that In the story Dan is transformed into something like nothing anyone would have believed possible The dan in the box wa all Twilight Zone It the perfect balance of horrific yet childish We don actually see it on screen it just the shadow with a brief cut to his face Just like how they didn show the triplicate gopher this is a smart touch not only because their special effect aren great but they leave more to the imagination When I see that cartoonishly deranged rabbit puppet pop out of the hat in the 1983 movie I can take anything seriously For what it worth it a funny scene filled with cheese just not what I expected This also happens in the 2002 revival when old Anthony burn a hole through someone and set them on fire That episode ha it own share of problem but we leave that for another day amp x200B Overall this wa a real good episode that deserves it spotlight Some worldbuilding and the of the nuance of Anthony character is lost from the original story but other thing are added like Dan telling Anthony off that heighten the conflict and make for a more entertaining watch Moonglow wa a good musical choice leaving behind a nostalgic bitterness behind it cheery service If I been familiar with this I would felt the absence of Doris Day lovely voice Not a super deep one but it compels you with the fear of being subjugated by a fickle omnipotent force to the point that you can even have your own thought And the feeling of closeted entropy that permeates this episode is just wonderful Everything will rot Hurrah amp x200B This is a random note but sometime around the end Mrs Fremont call Mr Fremont dad I can tell if this wa a mistake or if she just doe this because he Anthony dad and the world revolves around Anthony His parent are never given name which is odd Don Keefer wa great too I love how when he say the brandy is real good you can tell he actually being genuine for the first time in a long time So uh give this one a watch And read the original story too It online For free And tell me if you want more of these Leave some comment give your thought on the episode More to come Someday,The Groan Zone It a Good

727,Disco_Jones,TwilightZone,My favorite episode are the one where something that doesn make sense within our understanding of reality is happening to one person or a group of people and they end up questioning their own sanity Example episode would be And When The Sky Was Opened my absolute favorite episode A World of Difference Nightmare at 20 000 foot The Hitchhiker and Living Doll Something about these episode just fill me with a sense of dread that I just love Nothing is scarier to me than something so unexplainable happening that the only logical solution is that you either completely insane or the butt end of a highly elaborate fantastically conceived practical joke Anyone have any more episode that fit this general theme Thanks,More episode like these

736,Vault-Tec95,TwilightZone,It just doesn feel like a Twilight Zone episode to me and that would make sense due to it being purchased and not made or written by the Twilight Zone creator Out of all the short film they could have purchased to be a Twilight Zone episode they could have picked a better story that fit in to the Twilight Zone,What do people think of the An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge episode from Season 5

741,hexensabbat,TwilightZone,Hello I been binge watching this wonderful show the past few day and despite watching and enjoying this show all throughout my life I hadn really sat down and really given the writing my full attention It is really mind blowing how well most of the episode hold up and how relevant they still remain today and how emotionally effective many of them are My favorite script ha been that of Eye of the Beholder a well a the performance of the lead actress her vocal acting some is incredible However one line from another episode really grabbed me with it beauty The intro to the episode A Passage for Trumpet Joey Crown musician with an odd intense face whose life is a quest for impossible thing like flower in concrete or like trying to pluck a note of music out of the air and put it under glass to treasure I replayed that last line several time I don know what it is but that music metaphor and how it wa delivered are just so beautiful to me The episode itself also affected me quite a bit For anyone who hasn seen it it is about a downtrodden trumpet player in NYC struggling with alcoholism and becoming suicidal As someone who ha dealt with those feeling before it felt like I wa meant to watch it I felt for Joey and enjoyed the message of the ep Anyway with that said What are your favorite line from the series Or which episode overall did you enjoy the writing of the most,Favorite line from The Twilight Zone
742,Uncledowntown,TwilightZone,Can wait for the reboot,Remember you were on this sub before it blew up

744,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,Even with a few awkward moment along the way to me this is the most emotionally powerful episode of the show From the beginning where the grandmother is clingy possessive of Billy a broadly a it played it still manages to convey the mix of creepiness sadness and vulnerability someone in her position provides The fact Billy parent refuse to explain to him what happening to his grandmother establishes the theme of the episode the denial of death perfectly The way that we never hear the grandmother voice come through the toy phone Billy us to speak to her is perfect in adding ambiguity to the episode that made it more resonant for me We don know what on the other side and not making it explicit is utterly appropriate Phillip Abbot If you love him let him live monologue is the best moment of the show for me It where the hook of TZ at it best ordinary people in extraordinary circumstance come most alive to me because it possibly the most nakedly someone break down in the face of the potentially supernatural circumstance they find themselves in It a guy talking on a toy telephone to someone he shouldn believe is there it so undignified and yet the moment is so committed to that I can tear up thinking about it The insignificant thing that he list off that Billy will never experience if his potentially desperately lonely grandmother keep tap into some really primal emotion for me I can even fully imagine the grandmother a she let go and feel some inkling of how painful that would be By the end it doesn even feel like it a story about ghost and the supernatural It about confronting and accepting the loss of loved one reaffirming life even in the face of the inevitable death we don want to confront Even shot on ugly video it so beautiful,Spoilers I going to gush about Long Distance Call

750,Anton_Meme,TwilightZone,nan,Can someone explain to me the ending of the episode A stop at Willoughby
751,CletusVanDamnit,TwilightZone,I been rewatching the series from the beginning and just hit one of my favorite episode The Lateness of the Hour I always thought it looked different than the others but never looked up why until tonight Turns out they were running way over budget on most episode and shot 6 episode on video to save money In the end it wasn enough of a saving and they felt it ruined the look of the show Personally I don really mind the way it look It kind of seems a bit surreal and I don mind it or find it distracting in any way What do you think,Does anyone like the look of the episode shot on video
752,Mary_Pick_A_Ford,TwilightZone,I recently watched it today because I forgot Barry Nelson wa the guest star in it I think the first time I watched it I wa confused on where they were exactly I wa a kid This third time I watching it a an adult it just fall a little flat for me I don really understand why the two of them get picked out out of all the human on Earth by the alien father that is supposedly bigger than Earth a well So are these alien just super gigantic then If that the case why doe the little girl have to have a doll house when she can just play with the live figure on Earth then The moral message the episode keep alluding to is to not drive and drive otherwise some big as alien are going to pick and punish you for it I really love most Twilight Zone episode but this one seemed too much of a stretch JMO Any thought,Does anybody like the episode where the couple is stuck in Circleville
753,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,If you bothered coming to this subreddit you probably know that the whole reason Serling started appearing on camera for intro and outros from the second season on wa that it got a good reception when he did it at the end of the final first season episode A World of His Own I surprised they didn try to finish off Season 5 with an episode where they do something where Serling go from being effectively the host to a character in the show They give some sort of hint why he able to appear unnoticed in these story why he brings the Twilight Zone with him etc It feel like it could be equally well played for horror or laugh It not like it would have been too unusual at the time since Jack Benny program had been pretty popular for awhile and it wa a meta show I know by then they were sort of running on fume but even if they bungled it the idea seems like it would have made for a memorable episode anyway,A meta episode I surprised they didn do
754,Trogdor_98,TwilightZone,I just finished rewatching The Monsters are Due on Maple Street and I realized something I hadn noticed before The episode is about how often the true monster are doubt prejudice and fear The whole story revolves on the fact that no one is really attacking the earth but none the le the people are searching for someone to blame and the devolve into a mob who hunt and murder eachother before pointing the next finger For this myself and many others feel this is one of the best episode turning the focus from the supernatural to the frightening reality of the cold war Unfortunately what ruin it is the fact that the ending show that there ARE alien manipulating everything meaning that while they were targeting the wrong people they weren wrong and their initial suspension wa correct This ruin the WHOLE message of the episode,The Monsters are Due on Maple Street One of the best AND worst episode of the Twilight Zone

760,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,The female protagonist truly got betrayed by the male friend she meet at the bus station That true right It sad because he start off being kind and gentle unlike the baggage station clerk who just kept yelling at her but she talk to him get to know him and all that then he decides to wait it out and catch the next bus and stay with her He the one who called 911 and had her arrested Had her committed after being so kind to her initially That is what betrayal is At least he got his comeuppance when the same thing happened to him and he literally had to chase himself out of the bus station and interestingly enough wa unable to catch himself Meanwhile that show the episode never ended and wa never resolved On the other hand Good Riddance Some handsome stranger you just can trust,Okay let me get this straight In the episode Mirror Image
761,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Let see 1 First there the original well done twilight zone with pig people and a beautiful face under bandage making for a compelling plot about loving all people It could be looked at a a case of discrimination 2 SNL I don know whether or not anyone remembers or if it should count or not a canon since it wa just a sketch and a spoof but Pamela Anderson did it She wa the girl under the bandage and we got a chance to see what the pig mask look like in color they take off the bandage to reveal Pamela Anderson but instead of being put off and horrified all the male doctor fall in love with her and the female doctor look around and say What going on I don get it what happening I can forget this qoute It be hard for me to go home to my pig faced wife after seeing her 3 2002 Twilight Zone Same title same name different host Forest Whitaker This is awkward to say the least No pig mask no pig people no pigmayllion Maybe this episode wa to help Forest Whitaker through his disability but it insensitive to people who actually have suffered a stroke Well he suffered a left eye ptosis and that carry some similar symptom but not on the extreme level of a stroke Anyways the ugly people have face that look like they melting One of their eye is permanently closed and they carry themselves a stroke victim too and the entire episode just play on the same like I said this one is awkward No wonder Twilight Zone 2002 wa cancelled so quickly amp x200B Let me know if I missed any,How many time ha Eye of the beholder been done and recreated

764,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Because I do I find that The Twilight Zone run more smoothly and episode are much more enjoyable when they have nothing to do with the military because then thing take on a serious realistic tone instead of one fantasy and science fiction I mean they could have even made a few mild mention about a military existing but they should not have had it center on air force base and army recruit it just brings everything down for me I noticed the same thing whenever I watch The Twilight Zone in color and The Twilight Zone 2002 so sometimes thing never change no matter how much you redoctor it up,Does anyone else avoid all of the military themed episode
765,Vault-Tec95,TwilightZone,Shot in Black and White and on 35mm film Having the right clothes and product for the decade Even down to the ad being done by the host Personally I think it a good idea and I think it would be a good nod to the original,Would anyone be up for even one episode being made like it still the 60

767,Bran_Yaltz,TwilightZone,So I don know how all of this subreddit feel but I excited From what I can tell the other revival failed because they did not have a strong authorial voice behind them Get Out felt like a long Twilight Zone episode to the point that when I saw it I said to a friend I would only get excited for a Twilight Zone reboot if he headed it up Of course he not Rod Serling he Jordan Peele It going to be different but I think it gonna be really good Anyway what do you guy think,I real excited for Jordan Peele the Twilight Zone
768,Smerphy,TwilightZone,The two are constantly compared but they not identical Black Mirror is too intent on explaining everything while Twilight Zone prefers to leave most thing unexplained which leaf more of an opening for creativity The more satirical episode of BM are great but more recently they been trying to be a realistic a possible and realism ha never been Charlie Brooker strong suit Hoping the new Twilight Zone can delve into social issue and ethical question while remaining in the Sci Fi Fantasy genre,Hoping this show doesn just become an American version of Black Mirror with the name Twilight Zone
769,Myson91,TwilightZone,I remember being young when it came on and not having the same kind of wonder I had watching the original series but it been so long I couldn tell you why What your take on it What I somewhat remember wa so vast majority of remake that didn really add anything to the original just a colorized le profound version,What were some of the biggest reason why the 2002 series flopped

772,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,Personally I think they both pretty good I never thought the original wa one of TZ best episode I probably put thirty maybe thirty five episode ahead of it Don get me wrong it excellent TV But I just feel better TZ episode out there exist With that said the Shatner version is superior to the Lithgow version in that it ha more psychological depth However I think the remake is better directed and feature a more convincing gremlin So I guess it a draw for me amp x200B What about you,Which version of Nightmare at Twenty Thousand Feet do you prefer the one with Shatner or the one with Lithgow

775,Happy2BeHere2day,TwilightZone,Watched the most recent MOVIE FIGHTS episode on the Screen Junkies YouTube channel and one of the question wa Which classic Twilight Zone episode would make the best movie The three fighter chose The Eye of the Beholder Nightmare at 20 000 Feet and The Purple Testament The winner wa ultimately The Purple Testament Someone suggested Time Enough at Last a well Personally I think It a Good Life would make the best movie Unlike other Twilight Zone episode the conflict isn resolved at the end Anthony is still able to terrorize Peaksville Ohio with his power That why I think a movie could be able to expand on that another hour plus of Anthony causing mischief and the people of Peaksville trying to create a plan to stop him You could put the episode at the beginning of the movie and go from there So I ask you what TZ episode do you think would make the best movie,Which classic Twilight Zone episode would make the best movie

781,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,I talking about the big tall wish I get that he supposed to be a washed out boxer who had a rough life outside of the ring but he wa just so negative and sour all of the time plus he almost broke his entire hand by attempting to punch someone and commit violence in the locker room so besides being hot tempered he just wasn that smart This episode had the making to be something epic Muhammad Ali VS Joe Frazier style but it just fell flat because he wa so unlikable and in the ring he wa just standing there while his opponent waled and rained down punch on him just before the fight wa over Henry make the wish and the opponent and Bolie switch place and suddenly Bolie win Nobody except Bolie can recall how the fight began I guess if Henry went ahead and asked the opponent what really happened and what his recollection wa it would open a plot hole but that neither here nor there when he tried to tamper with Henry freewill by telling Henry that he too old to believe in magic let Henry believe a he chooses Bolie He is just so unsympathetic especially by the end of the episode when that happened,Does anyone else not like Bolie
782,sweetjiji,TwilightZone,Honestly in the split second we saw of them I cared more about them than our three astronaut who we all know just wanted to find their way home Clearly do the people who take to forum and complain that the beauty queen wa homely and unattractive Did they miss the episode Eye Of The Beholder and Number 12 Looks Just Like You Enough said with that analogy and who to say that someone else definition of beauty is wrong How do we know that the astronaut who wa complimenting her and her Plain Jane librarian look doesn actually like his girl homely and unattractive Not everybody is attracted to supermodel some like their woman to be on the plain side and others like woman who are ugly Maybe he see beauty in what plain and if that wa the case then that would make me like him and not care one way or another about his two friend Now obviously the girl in beauty queen segment always wanted to be beautiful when she wa alive didn happen couldn afford plastic surgery so she stipulated in her will that she be placed on display winning a Miss America competition while her more beautiful contestant lose and look on in envy So what wrong with that Who wa the mayor anyways We know he wasn even really a mayor official or a person in charge of anything What wa he like when he wa alive and isn his story worth telling Was he a young man who wa constantly beaten down and bullied and only escaped a a man about town or a man in demand in his own fantasy Clearly he wanted to be celebrated and in charge in life never got the chance so why not have it in death He cast one shadow of mystery that could never be uncloaked and the clock with no hand signifies he never leave office after election This wa his fantasy so why did it come to that Why not ask to be president or a king or a sultan How badly wa he bullied in life and did he ever lash out Seems he cared more about being celebrated loved adored and appreciated in life and it never came to fruition so why not get it after death Both of them definitely paint a tragic picture when you look deep into the episode,Elegy question Why is everybody so hard on the poor homely girl corpse winning the beauty pageant and on the one corpse constantly being elected mayor for all eternity

785,maneceel96,TwilightZone,1 I hope Jordan Peele realizes what he ha in his hand with the Twilight Zone license and doesn just create a TV version of Get Out 2 I hope the show doesn call back to previous TZ episode too much I would like for them to pay homage to the series with an episode that completely in black and white or something like that but a a whole create a product that is exciting original and all without losing that unique TZ atmosphere and quality 3 I know the 1959 series had a lot of political commentary but because the political climate of today is so cancerous I just hope that those commentary are not put before the atmosphere overall story and character and are done in a tasteful way I very curious to see how It all play out I think anything that get people interested in watching The Twilight Zone is a positive and If it can reach Black Mirror quality then holy crap it going to be a fun time to be a fan a Black Mirror is the only show to rival the 1959 Twilight Zone series with it thought provoking story and A production quality,Discussion What are your hope for the 2019 reboot

825,annabelltaylor2019,TwilightZone,So in this hypothetical situation you would be transported to the setting in the episode that your character appears in You can choose to play out the entire episode or just certain scene from it However everything that occurs in the episode also happens to you there no changing anything to your added benefit You can also choose to leave the episode setting and return to your normal life at any time Which character would you like to experience being for a short time I would personally choose Henry J Fate from Mr Denton on Doomsday You get to help out a down on his luck Al Denton and having access to all those potion and tonic seems cool Other fun choice to me are Gabriel from A Passage for Trumpet being an angel and a great musician Frisby coming up with crazy story and actually being abducted by alien and Gregory West being able to make anything come to life by describing it,Which twilight zone character would you like to be

852,Prometheus357,TwilightZone,Okay I just want to say I have been a long time fan of the Zone which inevitably lead me to The Gallery which led me to Serling himself and his work I wanted to get more Serling Patterns amp Requiem for a Heavyweight came next and I still wa gluttonous for more I bought every book that I could find in hope to dig deeper into his Radio Catalog his Teleplay Catalog etc then His film beyond Planet of the Apes Seven Days in May etc then there a book out just recently Rod Serling His Life His Work His Imagination and boy oh boy is this pretty darn close to having his fully body of work it 500 page but it isn intimidating at all it a clean and smooth read with synopsis of nearly everything else ever committed to the page And TZ only cover 1 5 of the page in this book I urge folk in this sub to pick it up reading over my post this doe seem like an ad but it not I promise I just really love this man work a lot of writer talk about their mission to write about the human condition but rod work really nail it and it a crime that his work isn more readily available for the mass because all of it is still relevant today it still speaks to those who think themselves a the obsolete man The disenchanted the lonely the brave the bold the strange the beautiful and the weird his work is parable not of his time but our time I hope that the more folk pick this up the more it will show his estate that there is an interest in Rod work beyond that middle ground between light and shadow beyond that pit of man fear and above that summit of knowledge that dimension of imagination and that area which we call the Twilight Zone,The work of Rod Serling

855,WorkOrange,TwilightZone,Why did they add this character in the second season An ease into commercial break or something It break the flow of the story for me,The Narrator
856,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,This is an episode from Season 4 I can say it bad Really bad Before you read my analysis go watch it I not going to explain the plot because I don understand the plot I give you a quick summary One guy stop for gas in a small town that guarding the secret of magical alien technology that can do essentially anything and they detain him because he know their secret That it Let me say why it bad The character make bad decision Say everyone in your town ha some magical Alien technology and you trying to keep it secret What the best way to keep a secret like that This town ha a completely OPEN ROAD leading into it They simply assume that due to their remote location NOBODY will ever wander in and stop for gas or food Is this stupid Yes It is established that these people can produce any food they want any object they want They have no lack of resource and nobody ever leaf they perfectly content SO WHY DO THEY HAVE AN UNGUARDED ENTRANCE INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD This would make sense Put a log in the middle of the road or a big rock so people can drive through and a sign that say Road Closed Not their big giant magical invisible forcefield a this would arouse suspicion but just a barrier that make it seem like there nothing notable back there Chances are they could just fade into obscurity like that But they have a SIGN right outside This is like if Area 51 had a day where you could come in and take all the picture of alien you wanted These people are so bad at keeping a secret and then they imprison this guy just because he happened to pick out their town at random But it go even farther than that When he first get to the town this kid us her magical alien technology to make the guy dog disappear The guy wonder how his dog disappeared and he see the kid playing with the techno thingy but her dad the gas station attendant say it just her radio and then she make his dog come back Now this seems like a reasonable excuse The guy assumes that maybe his dog just ran off somewhere for a minute and maybe it is just a radio So he drive off THIS IS A SMART CHOICE By this point the guy doesn care He ha his gas and his dog If the townspeople just let him go he WOULD NOT CARE or think about visiting this town EVER AGAIN He a newspaper reporter but he wouldn report his dog running away in some little town Seems like the townspeople have managed to keep their secret right NOPE They raise their HUGE INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD and his car literally CRASHES INTO NOTHING then his dog DIES then the townspeople bring his dog BACK TO LIFE These people do not want to be thought of a normal or hide a secret This is clear They want to be a bizarre a possible This is the only thing I can conceive of Are they idiot Dorn the mayor state in the episode that they not really evil they just want to keep their secret They don want to keep him there but they have to in order to keep their secret But he say he a prominent reporter and people will come looking for him Won they Yes they will Dorn call it the best kept secret in the world Is it Is it really You leave your town wide open you act insane and you so obviously hiding something These people just want to stand out They can sorta want to hide their secret but also keep an open connection to the outside world It one or the other The town ha a hotel and a restaurant but they not real The hotel is supposedly completely booked but all the guest are out and the restaurant is ALWAYS CLOSED Why doe the gas station work then Why would these people need gas if they never go anywhere and can have all the food they want Does this town NEED all these totally fake business everywhere to make their town seem more normal It would seem more normal to have NO restaurant or hotel than to have restaurant and hotel that ARE FAKE Some town have no restaurant or hotel They could just tell him we don have a restaurant or a hotel so you have to go somewhere else He leave Easy But that isn the worst part The worst part is at the end of the episode THEY REALIZE THAT THEY CAN JUST ERASE HIS MEMORY with their technology and restore everything back to normal so he won know what happened This render all the prior conflict completely pointless Also we supposed to feel sad that he doesn know the lady anymore It would be sad if she wa his wife BEFORE he entered the town and she had to stay there I not invested in their romance He just some random guy and she just some random lady and she betrayed him anyway and if they go their separate way then so what It a happy ending Overall this episode is bad Serling and Co really struck out with this one Twilight Zone episode are good when he character do believable thing We cheer on the people when they leave Pall imaginary apocalypse we praise Templeton when he decides to pursue his passion we identify with the guy who alone with nobody but his reflection to speak with Those are good episode This episode is bad because nobody doe anything that make sense It could be good if it wa executed properly like if the townspeople really did try to keep their technology a secret and did everything in their power to help this poor guy escape Dorn say that the last time anybody wandered in it wa 1953 What happened to that guy Did they turn his car into Spaghetti Os and then tell him nothing wa bizarre,Valley Of The Shadows suck

878,superboss2015,TwilightZone,Does anyone know how many there are total,I found 2 old Twilight Zone novel
879,Ace76inDC,TwilightZone,This really happened OK the episode I dreamt itself wasn all that creepy but it definitely creepy I dreamt an entire episode character subplots and all The wife had a bad night of sleep and woke me up at about 2am the day before Halloween about two week ago and you know how you remember dream clearly if you wake up suddenly That happened to me Here the weird part my dream wa a complete full length black and white version of the 1960s Twilight Zone Not a dream about an episode that I seen but rather a brand new episode concocted entirely by my subconscious Almost right away the next morning I started telling people about it and my wife in particular encouraged me to write it down I didn wake up in the middle of the episode and decided to finish it I dreamt the whole damn thing start to finish And wa woken up at the exact moment it ended My dream had Nazis in it I going to write about Nazis f you think for a minute I condone Nazis or hate you are dead wrong and I think my value are pretty well reflected by my dream Before you react to this post please read to the very end If you are a Nazi or a racist and you feel a need to reply don I ignore you and your dead ideology They say men don dream dialogue but woman do I can say either way I don recall distinct word or conversation just mostly thought scene and concept I did embellish my dream with the opening and closing narrative Rod Serling style that match my impression in the dream of knowing the setting and implication of the story I also made up a title to match my dream I also heard that men dream in black and white Not too sure about that since I had colorful dream This dream though wa completely black and white just like the old Twilight Zone series I don think a story like this would hold up today But compared to Twilight Zone episode which I since researched I never saw them before my dream like Death Head Revisited and He Alive I think it hold up pretty well I have seen plenty of Star Trek story with Nazis in them This story is similar to Man in a High Castle but not in a contemporary sense everyone in my dream really talked and acted like they did in the original Twilight Zone I also not a writer I an engineer I have no idea how to write a screenplay So I write this a an outline like a Wikipedia episode summary Oh and I apologize this isn a particularly scary Twilight Zone even though I dreamt it up pretty close to Halloween Here it go Living History Opening Scene An outdoor museum similar to Gettysburg in Pennsylvania with wood fencing horse and people in costume and school child bustling about But the camera pull back and reveal tank Nazi flag soldier and statue Visitors child and staff alike wearing Nazi armband Opening Narration Picture an America a lovely field in Pennsylvania but not an America or the Pennsylvania we know today No this America succumbed to the Nazi horde in the Second World War and now life a a subjugated people of the far larger empire of the Third Reich and the bitter memory of this war have long faded In this America lie a museum a living history museum on the site of the last battle of that conflict where her last hope wa extinguished The visitor to this museum come from far and wide to learn about the Master Race victory over the feeble democracy loving Allies What the visitor worker and administrator of this museum will soon come to find out some candle and flame cannot be so easily extinguished in the Twilight Zone Plot Summary The museum is in full swing on a busy day Located somewhere in Pennsylvania the staff put on a show for visitor like a living history museum There are horse ride tank fake uniform and weapon and a few old fashioned wood fence near some WWII trench There is even a pit where Nazi child can come and stomp on an American Flag and several are there stomping away with many more lined up behind them note no it kind of doesn make sense that a horse would be in a WWII museum but there wa definitely a horse in my dream and played a big role The museum staff is quite large with quite a few worker but the Nazi administrator are pretty bored and disinterested except when they are giving order The museum really isn being run all that well Nazis clearly looking forward to the future and not spending much time keeping the place up The horse ride is a disaster the road to the museum is a mess and the place is generally completely run down Our story start with a person I felt wa an Affable American Loser He didn get a name in my dream so I call him AL for short He is the youngest and lowliest member of the staff in charge of horse ride When the supervisor aren around he make all sort of joke with his fellow staff who advise him to keep it down or else he get in trouble A Nazi Supervisor an American but in a Nazi uniform is dressing him down for not following order to give all the child ride before the day is over He complains that the horse is overworked and hasn had enough hay and water The Nazi supervisor isn having it He becomes outraged denies Al request for more hay and water and insists that he fill his ride quota a ordered He explains or shout that he ha been ordered to maintain the museum in an orderly and efficient manner in accordance with the tenet of National Socialism There is a grand inspection tomorrow evening and he insists everything be working at peak efficiency or else With that he stomp off That evening when putting the horse away Al get separated from his other worker and discovers a back door to the prop and supply room normally off limit He pause to admire a Nazi general uniform In the supply room he find a basket of apple and secret them out near the kid horse ride area The next day Al ha his horse ride operation running at peak efficiency thanks to the apple he is secretly feeding his horse The Nazi Supervisor come by and note the better operation He still hold a grudge from yesterday debacle and move on without acknowledging Al work After he leaf a messenger arrives with a message for the Nazi Supervisor The messenger state that the head Nazi General administrator ha been delayed for several day Al being mischievous tell the messenger he a trusted senior member of the museum staff and he convey the message personally to the Supervisor The messenger leaf and Al pull an apple out of his pocket start juggling it in the air and whistle He clearly isn going to deliver the message That evening Al sneak back into the prop room to get more apple On his way out he again admires the general uniform this time he decides to try it on After putting on a fake mustache and monocle his is nearly completely indistinguishable from his former self But a he is putting on his last goose stepping boot he lean up against a wall that turn out to be a door to a conference room Straightening up he see the Museum and local Nazi administrator all lined up at a conference table Seeing him they snap to attention and salute Heil Hitler After a few stunned moment Al realizes he need to fake his way out of this situation He decides to vent his frustration of working at the museum Note Al fake a pretty good German accent I just can write one that well You call this a museum Look at this place The attraction are barely functional the staff lazy this place is a mess and the road coming in is a disaster This place is a disgrace to National Socialism I order that the road repaired immediately animal fed clean up crew established etc etc I order you to make this place run like a well oiled Nazi machine The Supervisor sputter but sir we have not been ordered before to do any of these thing The General reply Well YOU VE BEEN ORDERED NOW THINK OF WAYS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND GET TO WORK After a few moment of stunned silence Al say DISMISSED At that word the Nazis in the conference room scramble out the door to enact the fake General order Al wait just a bit then hurry back to the prop room to change back a fast a he can He emerges to find the Supervisor barking order at the museum staff empowering them to make a many change a possible Al come out of the prop room just in time The Supervisor start to chastise him for not being at his duty station but the horse come by with a happy child on it back The Supervisor leaf without another note Some of Al fellow museum worker give him knowing glance showing that some of them likely know about Al biggest trick ever A key beat is when the Supervisor insists that the museum staff think for themselves making the museum run more efficiently The Supervisor pause for just a moment not quite understanding the implication of what he is ordering people to do Flash forward a few day the museum is running at it highest efficiency ever The road is fixed people are very happy to be there and the trash is picked up A visible transformation ha occurred Al ha become a leader of this effort and the Nazi American Supervisor ha grown to appreciate him At the museum conference room the gathered Administrators which now include Al himself are congratulating themselves and discussing at great length what else could be fixed Having gotten the museum up and running smoothly they are looking at their surrounding town and village and start making suggestion how to fix them like getting train and bus running on time to allow more visitor to the museum Just then the real German Nazi General show up After the usual saluting and Heil Hitler ing the General launch into a tirade JUST WHAT IS GOING ON WHO GAVE THE ORDERS TO USE RESOURCES TO FIX THE MUSEUM and so on The Nazi American Supervisor speaks up hesitantly Sir we were just following order to make this museum run a efficiently a He get cut off WHO AUTHORIZED YOU TO MAKE THESE CHANGES HOW DARE YOU WORK WITHOUT PROPER ORDERS YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING PROPER NATIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES and he really start sputtering accusation The assembled Administrators glare at the General You know in the way they always seemed to do in the old Twlight Zone show That kind of long 60 glare that would be edited down to 0 02 second in a modern TV show with the horn blaring The Nazi American Supervisor grows a backbone maybe for the first time ever No sir you are wrong We are following proper National Socialist value It is you who are out of line Guards please take the General to the Officer quarter and hold him there They do so the General sputtering the whole way The Supervisor turn to his administrative staff After a moment of careful consideration he speaks Gentlemen I believe what we have learned here at this museum can be a great benefit to the people of the Third Reich There are many inefficiency of how our Government run How do we best spread our technique to the larger country After a rapid discussion the gathered Administrators come to an astonishing conclusion They realize they must take charge of the weapon at the museum bring them back into service and seize the local burgermeister office Then they will be able to implement change to the train bus line food supply quality of life etc The Administrators are absolutely convinced they are acting in the best interest of National Socialism and all excitedly rush to action A revolution ha started But a small detail come up a they are rushing to exit the museum Someone call out how will we distinguish ourselves from the Nazis who have lost their way Some discussion ensues Everyone wear the Nazi armband and everyone ha the same uniform and Nazi flag Then Al standing near the back is lightning struck by an idea He rush over to the flag stomping pit and reach down for the American flag As he grasp the staff of the tattered torn and beat up star and stripe the museum worker and supervisor all gather around and look up to it Just starting to comprehend that they haven been acting in the best interest of National Socialism They been acting in the interest of something else something that ha been forgotten for far too long A faint music play a memory of SCENE Closing Narration The gathered people and staff don quite comprehend what a profound transformation ha happened in their humble worn down and nearly forgotten museum Seeking to enact a more perfect form of National Socialism they have learned it basic intrinsic flaw Human initiative and thought are incompatible with a system that demand strict obedience to order above all else From this modest spark a great fire of freedom ha been kindled For the self evident truth of Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are just a self evident and just a true even in the darkest corner of the Twilight Zone,One Year Ago Tonight I Dreamt a Full Complete Original Episode of the 1960s Twilight Zone

881,Adres_Mars,TwilightZone,I been getting into the twilight zone recently but I only seen three episode anyone have suggestion of good one,Any suggestion
882,DoubleTFan,TwilightZone,I hardly a snob about the show I like The Whole Truth and Come Wander with Me and I pretty sure those are widely reviled But I would be a little surprised if anyone considered this one even average I thought it wa kind of neat that the main character wa the same guy who played a crazy preacher in Midnight Cowboy but the performance grate before the opening credit start there hardly a twist worthy of the name and there maybe one semi decent joke the thing about eating brownie instead of cooke,Are there fan of Sounds and Silences
883,kornno25,TwilightZone,I just saw a Thai telenovela that ha the similar concept with TZ or NG a creepy story in one individual episode There wa an episode about a criminal who living in the jail drew a picture of his dream home and went missing but actually he lived INSIDE the picture and it wa sent to his family Later he wa found coming out of the picture so his wife burnt down his picture called the cop so that he can hide anymore and wa killed,Is there a TZ episode about a criminal or whoever that hide in the picture to escape something
884,ChrisPyExtravaganza,TwilightZone,I wa curious if there were any edits or version of the Twilight Zone without narration I noticed that a lot of episode really hit you over the head by explaining what is going on and ruin the atmosphere and the mood It a Good Life is a great of this where the narrator explains the entire premise of the episode before it even begin kind of kill the suspense amp x200B I couldn find any info on version without the narration so I assume they don exist but I wa just wondering if anyone knew of such a thing,Edits of Twilight Zone without narration
885,MikeWjr,TwilightZone,So I been trying to find an episode of the show for YEARS now and I not too sure if it exists all I know is the plot synopsis I remember being in seventh grade and doing public speaking presentation My friend though wa by far my favorite and at the end he mentioned it wa adapted to short story format from an episode of The Twilight Zone Again I been trying to find it since Here the story Once possibly in a small town a streak of light is seen shooting over the sky and I think land somewhere near where the people live Everybody freaked out and want to know what happening but they believe it to be an alien spaceship now I might completely misremembered that part but I remember people thinking alien were present I can remember why but the people begin to panic possibly because of fear of invasion In the panic a small boy call everyone attention and announces it IS alien but the alien can take the form of human being a wa seen in his comic book Now this part I might just imagined now or just now remembered I not sure One man in the crowd say that ridiculous but the others in the crowd start to accuse him saying that what an alien would say Some others in the crowd I think start to say similar thing or start accusing others of being alien disguised a human This in turn break everybody trust in each other Now if that last part wa all imagined this is probably what happened instead though I think the first one wa right The people so desperately searching for answer take what the boy say and begin to silently lose trust in one another I think the boy comic book doe say something about alien invading and that might be where the fear spark from But also about them killing eating exterminating the human race maybe Eventually people start to turn Friends on friend neighbor on neighbor I think family on family Nobody trust anyone and they all start fighting A big war battle fight ensues and people have lost all mercy Friendships become rivalry family become stranger and mankind at least in this area ha become a community of executioner I believe At the end it revealed to the audience that the alien never invaded but scared the human into thinking so a they knew this would in turn cause mankind destroy itself,Can anybody help me find if this episode exists

898,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,There are lot of good brain puzzler in the Original Series Episode 2 of Season 3 for instance The Arrival even go so far a to declare itself a mind bending puzzle and say that paradox are the National Pastime in The Twilight Zone Interesting statistic I knew it probably wasn baseball There are other one with good twist that you have to figure out Five Characters After Hours and so on Today I be talking about Death Ship an episode from Season 4 which although bloated at an hour length like most Season 4 episode is a good brain teaser nonetheless Spoiler Alert This is the premise Three astronaut land on a planet One of them just so happens to be Jack Klugman I know he ha a name in the episode but from here on out I refer to him a Jack Klugman because he can play anybody except Jack Klugman Anyway they see another ship outside that wrecked They go inside and see their own corps lying on the floor From there they go into a form of hysteria The two astronaut who aren Jack Klugman experience vivid hallucination where they find themselves back on Earth Meanwhile Jack Klugman try to figure out what going on and why there a ship outside with their body in it He come up with three possible theory throughout the course of the episode 1 The ship outside is a manifestation of a possible future which may or may not happen 2 There are invisible alien on the planet who don like trespasser and are creating an illusion so they go away 3 They dead they ghost and the ship outside ha their real body By the end of the episode option 3 seems the most plausible since the ship outside just won go away The two astronaut who aren Jack Klugman break down ask him to let them die and rest in peace and Jack Klugman being a logical sort insists that there must be some scientific explanation and tell them that he keep looking for some explanation which clearly must not exist Overall it an interesting and feasible blend of the supernatural and rational and a captivating examination of the conflict between Logic and Religion By the end of the episode it seems a if solution 3 ha won out and they screwed But let assume that solution number one is true for a moment Jack Klugman theory hold that the ship outside show what may or may not happen depending on the choice they make etc This is by far the least threatening of the three since almost any future is possible at any moment based on the choice we make There are quintillion of alternate universe out there where you jump out of you car door at a certain second of the day Now picture this the ship outside doesn have a bush in it All they would have to do to avoid the probable future outside would be to change or alter something in their immediate vicinity In other word all they ever have to do is take a bush or something that outside and isn in the other ship or they could draw a picture of a strawberry and hang it on the wall just alter the scenario of their ship a little so that the exact future outside would be avoided Would this work,How To Survive Death Ship
899,insearchofsunrise7,TwilightZone,Why,What is your favourite quote from this show
900,ConnorK12,TwilightZone,The show seems to tick all the box for what I like to see An anthology of mysterious story all with a twist I love that stuff But I have a weird phobia throughout my life of dummy Let me explain in any old 50 or 60 movie if a person or creature wa represented with practical effect I never knew why but it give me the creep and I have to turn it off There rare occasion where it done well like the movie The Thing or Yoda in the Star Wars movie or Child Play but in movie like Them And War of the Worlds when the creature are clearly puppet I don know why it just really make my skin crawl same whenever human are represented the same way For example I heard of a Twilight Zone episode called The Invaders and that two small human figure get out of a very small airship and I can watch that episode because I know those little figure will be toy or puppet How often are effect like that used in the series,Really wanna watch the show but I have a strange phobia Can anyone help

903,cicibellis4ever,TwilightZone,Maybe an episode that is considered one of the best but you find boring Or an episode that is constantly thrashed but is your guilty pleasure For example I enjoy Once Upon a Time and Black Leather Jackets I find Once Upon a Time to be comic relief and the episode play out like a Three Stooges skit I also genuinely enjoy the old subtitle and silent film aspect in the opening and ending scene I like Black Leathet Jackets the same way you would enjoy your cheesy sci fi movie It meant to be quirky and offbeat It reminds me of the low budget B horror sci fi movie that premiered in the 50 and 60 s,Which episode do you go against the public perception Which one make you go against the grain

930,TheSwarml0rd,TwilightZone,Hi all Just wondering if anyone feel the same way I do But doe anyone wonder what are the name of the music used across some of the episode In example within The After Hours at the beginning of the episode when we see Marsha browse the store and there is a piece of music in the background and it just so nice I tried using Shazam and I can get a result Another great example is within Where is Everybody when Mike walk into the Roadside cafe and there is the music being played from the Jukebox still no luck to which piece of music it is amp x200B If anyone doe know the song a way I can find it out That would be great TheSwarml0rd,Jazz Music within The Twilight Zone
931,TheSwarml0rd,TwilightZone,After rewatching The After Hours today It left me thinking about the Bellhop who take Marsha to the ninth floor It got me thinking is he a Mannequin He sound similar look similar to the Sailor Does he know about the mannequin He call the other shopper Locals which could suggest that maybe he know the mannequin a so called resident Is he only visible to the mannequin My thought behind this is that everybody is queuing and us the one elevator but the bellhop only offer Marsha in to the elevator Surely he would of asked for a larger amount of people Maybe only the Mannequins can see the express elevator a it the only way to the ninth floor where the mannequin congregate amp x200B What do you guy think,The Ominous Bellhop in The After Hours
932,InfectedThumb,TwilightZone,nan,Hi everyone new subscriber to this sub and a huge fan of the show I curious a to what episode is your least favorite and why
933,SalvajeSello,TwilightZone,nan,If Jordan Peele doesn make this new series in black and white I kinda gonna be mad
934,misterlakatos,TwilightZone,Watching Escape Clause and A Nice Place to Visit earlier inspired me to start a discussion Also can forget the lead actor from Sounds and Silences or The Fever,Least favorite main character
935,Kleetus_Van_Dam,TwilightZone,I really really like it I believe they are making a 2nd season Mark Hamill is a great narrator,Has anyone checked out Dimension 404 on Hulu
936,lilxan6,TwilightZone,best twilight zone episode in your opinion And which one have the biggest twist,best twilight zone episode amp best twist episode
937,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,My biggest beef with the reboots aside from uneven writing is none of them have been in color By filming them in color the reboots feel le like continuation of Serling vision and more like anonymous anthology program Peele need to have the gut with his take on TZ to shoot it in black and white otherwise it not going to have the TZ feel,Is TZ the same in color
938,leeman27534,TwilightZone,watching the episode again amused at this mouth every episode probably just a dick but it amuses me,the twilight zone wa on for like 5 season with Rod Sterling and the spookiest bit wa that busted as smile of his
939,leeman27534,TwilightZone,would make sense if he asked what time wa it where he wa from on earth right then or if the alien followed the idea of what time is it on earth they said well there are 24 hour timezones so it every hour of the day all at once on earth so close yet so far,odd problem with the episode to serve man they mention time is sort of abstract given human base time on day and whatnot when he asks for the time but he asks for the time on earth given a time of noon but it every hour on earth all at once
940,kimota68,TwilightZone,It on U S TRUTV just maybe because of the behind the scene aspect at the end I not going to lie apparently I never given Bobcat Goldthwait the respect he just might deserved all along but I am finding this show to be intriguing fun and a having the occasional surprise or two plus then there usually something extra fun or interesting about the behind the scene sequence It seems more consistently satirical than TWZ thus far but it clearly owes a lot to it and there haven been that many episode Anyway if I get some of you to check it out I hope none of you regret that,Has anybody else been enjoying Bobcat Goldthwait Misfits amp Monsters
941,Campymovie99,TwilightZone,I don mean the really bad one that stick with you like cavender is coming i mean the weird mediocre one that when you see the title go oh I forgot about that one For me it probably ha to be four o clock Such a weird nonsensical episode that I had blocked out of my mind to forget about only remembering when I saw the episode list,Most forgettable episode
942,Campymovie99,TwilightZone,I mean look at the original series Weather it the gloomy dread of season 1 the minimalist season 2 the hypnotic season 3 or the downright freakiness of season 4 and 5 they all hold a special place Then you have the masterpiece that is 1985 intro with it rural nightmare of being sucked into some weird house during dusk and seeing twisted vision But 2002 DUR WHY DONT WE JUST PUT IN A DUMBASS HARD ROCK VERSION OF THE SONG WITH SOME PISS POOR VISUALS BORED NARRATION AND A TITLE CARD THAT LOOKS LIKE A HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT CRAPPED IT OUT such a waste 2002 still had a few decent episode at least,Can we all agree the 2002 series intro wa laughably bad
943,Bronsonkills,TwilightZone,I understand the show had some consistency issue but I think it far stronger than it reputation It attempted on occasion to be experimental adapted some wonderful short story Like Silent Snow Secret Snow The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes and Cool Air If you like Serling own writing above all else They Tearing Down Tim Riley Bar is essential There is an interview where Rod say it is one of his favorite of everything he ever wrote The piece wa nominated for the Emmy that year for outstanding single program You can watch that one here but if argue the game hole series is a must http www dailymotion com video x5g5gbp,Night Gallery is so underrated
944,mangoAlcatraz,TwilightZone,He wa Johnny Foster who played a trumpet and wa loved beyond word He wa Virgil Sterig with money in his pocket He wa Andy Marshak who got some of his agony back on a sidewalk in front of a cheap hotel Hammer Foster Sterig Marshak and all four of them were dying,He wa Arch Hammer a cheap little man who just checked in

946,somery,TwilightZone,I watched this 25 year ago so forgive me if my memory is off The episode is about a man who see himself on television fighting with his wife and then throwing her out the window Later in the episode those same event happen in his real life,Need help finding an episode
947,Great_now_im_hungry,TwilightZone,One of my favorite episode Old man Simpson and Rip pulled it my heart string Such a great one,The Hunt
948,TheObsoleteMan6261,TwilightZone,You know the field everything got wished away to Well what if THIS planet is that field A twilight zone shower thought if you will,It a good life
949,choozer,TwilightZone,Apart from a few weak episode this left a bigger impression on me than Season 1 My favorite episode Shadow Play probably my most favorite TZ episode so far Namely because I personally had dream where I realize I in a dream and I trapped and I keep going back to sleep in the dream and hoping to wake up to reality but end up just waking up into another dream over and over again It FUCKING SUCKS A Penny for Your Thoughts funnier than I expected Dick York wa awesome even though I seen it a a child I wa riveted the entire time I really enjoyed how they took the concept and ran with it Lots of good idea executed well Silence it probably the most terrifying episode of all the TZs I watched Namely because it can take place in our reality Honorable mention Invaders enjoyed the creepy atmosphere and the fact it had uniquely almost zero dialogue until the end Mr Dingle not conceptually a strong episode but I enjoyed watching Burgess Meredith and Don Rickles performance Additional thought Prime Mover One of the few episode that contained the aggravating trope of the mc who doe progressively stupider and stupider thing but still found that the resolution saved the episode somewhat Eye of the Beholder obvious classic but since I remember it so vividly a a child the big reveal didn have the same impact on me a an adult A Most Unusual Camera really recommend the indie movie Time Lapse if you want to see an entire film based on this premise Night of the Meek just a sweet Xmas episode The Whole Truth really did not like how this ended with Khrushchev It made the episode topical and the lasting appeal of TZ is that it generally non topical and cover age old theme Also why I wasn crazy about the Genie in A Bottle one either The Rip Van Winkle Caper Like how they tied in the story with the conflict between the greedy thief gold bar and the water Obsolete Man Not crazy about this episode and felt it wa the weakest one in Season 2 Everything wa extremely overwrought I wa unfortunately spoilered for the Howling Man not sure what I would have thought if I watched it without knowing the reveal,Finished Season 2 Loved it What were your favorite episode from that season
950,choozer,TwilightZone,I not sure how they managed to execute that many show in that amount of time I know several of the show weren original content and based off of other story but STILL Putting a show together is hard and writing IMHO is even harder That schedule must have been GRUELING I amazed they churned out a many episode a they did,Does anyone find that Rod Serling ability to produce and write a good portion of 30 show a season wa an unbelievable feat
951,Uncledowntown,TwilightZone,nan,Fans of TZ should checkout Extinction on Netflix
952,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,The Swimmer and Seconds for me Seconds because it a variation on be careful what you wish for theme TZ explored often while The Swimmer is reminiscent of A Stop at Willoughby and Walking Distance with the slow descent into a nightmare quality of The After Hours,Movies that make better film version of The Twilight Zone than the one we got
953,symmetrypuffyshirts,TwilightZone,I love season 1 2 3 and some of 5 I watched twilight zone for a long time I binge it at least once or twice a year However I can remember the last time I checked out season 4 So got cbs now to watch some of it I never realized how the episode seem to drag There are a couple okay one But it just seems so stretched into a hour Each to their own but that my opinion,4th season my own opinion
954,choozer,TwilightZone,I like to compile a big list of film that are reminiscent of TZ These are generally categorized a mindbenders but not always IMHO they should involve some sort of unnatural twist and give you that eerie TZ feeling at some point or work out a scifi concept in a Zonesque way Basically it a if you expanded a TZ episode into a feature length film Hell I think some of these WERE based on TZ episode if loosely Feel free to disagree with the description Have any additional recommendation Particular favorite on or off the list Agree or disagree the one I listing below 12 Monkeys The 13th Floor 2001 Abre Los Ojos Altered States Being John Malkovich Butterfly Effect Cabin in the Woods Coherence Cube Dark City Donnie Darko Enemy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Exam Ex Machina Extinction Fight Club The Game Groundhog Day Her Identity The Jacket The Illusionist Inception Interstellar Jacob Ladder Live Die Repeat The Edge of Tomorrow Looper Lucky Number Sleven The Machinist Matrix Memento Moon Mr Nobody Oldboy The Others Pan Labyrinth Paprika Pi Predestination Prestige Primer Prisoners Requiem For a Dream Scanner Darkly Session 9 Shutter Island Signs Sixth Sense The Skin I Live In Source Code Take Shelter Time Lapse Timecrimes Triangle Vanilla Sky The Village,Compiling A List of Movies that are Twilight Zone ish

958,jeffcox31,TwilightZone,Is it a reasonable interpretation that the two kid actually drowned themselves in the pool And also something seems off about Aunt Tee and her eagerness to put the kid to work Is this going to turn out like A Nice Place To Visit and the kid are in hell This episode is such a mess that it seems like the first act of a story that follows up on some of these element but instead just load it up with cornpone accent and then stop by circling back to the beginning Oh Earl Hamner thank goodness The Waltons wa good anyway,The horror that is The Bewitchin Pool
959,Em8319,TwilightZone,I seen most of them but still would like to watch through them all again The DVD collection is quite expensive and it isn on netflix,Where can I watch this

964,choozer,TwilightZone,Wow nut Radio only played live music back then Funny to see the war between TV and radio in this episode Is this a boarding house for older folk They all lived here for twenty year Everybody attire wa way more polished looking back then They sitting around watching TV in dress shirt and pearl In the boarding house,Random thought and question watching Static
965,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,OK have any of you seen this one It one of those one that are filmed on videotape so that they look like junk Let me tell you about it There this lady in the hospital and she ha a boyfriend and then Dr Smith from Lost In Space is the doctor and every night the lady ha this dream where she go down to the hospital morgue and meet this creepy nurse who say Room for one more Honey then she leaf the hospital and almost get on this plane buit the nurse is on the plane so she run away and then the plane take off and blow up And that it Like The Grave this episode is cheap ripped off a bad example of a good show It from an old urban legend a a matter of fact except in the urban legend the nurse is a guy in a hearse and the plane is an elevator Apart from that nothing is changed This is a clear ripoff The only other thing that changed is the fact that the nurse say Honey Is that supposed to make it scarier It sound laughable They must have really run out of idea on the week this episode aired It awful It shot on videotape that one reason it suck It may a well have been recorded on Swiss cheese Not to say that some of the videotape episode aren good Long Distance Call is really good and it on videotape But Twenty Two ha both a dumb plot and a horrible shooting method which make it insufferable It an insult It look cheesy Apart from that none of the character are likable The lady is an idiot her boyfriend is an idiot and she still leaf the room even after Dr Smith tell her not to Dr Smith is OK but I can think of him doing anything other than being in Lost In Space He better in The Wager You can tell he doing nothing here The episode doesn even manage to instill a tiny amount of terror in me I know it ripped off and it never explained who the nurse is the best Twilight Zone episode don leave any loose end Those are my thought on this pathetic travesty What do you think,Twenty Two is HORRIBLE
966,KozmicBlooze,TwilightZone,These two tv show by Rod Serling are they lost I can find them anywhere anyone else know any release or place to watch them,The new people and Loner

968,doug65oh,TwilightZone,Literally just found something I wanted to see for many year The following program wa referred to by Keenan Wynn in his introduction to Patterns part of a series called The Golden Age Of Television that aired on PBS way the hell back when I had much darker hair and more of it 1981 or 82 Wynn mentioned that a few month after Patterns premiered he himself had appeared in a US Steel Hour episode which Serling had also written titled The Rack The mother is on youtube Yeah I know but I been wanting to see the show a opposed to the feature film for about 16 year For the curious it posted at http www youtube com watch v GLxlUPNSyqE,United States Steel Hour The Rack April 1955
969,choozer,TwilightZone,One thing I never noticed until I wa an adult wa the acting in TW Characters scream and yell and do all kind of thing that would be considered overacting these day probably due to the ascendance of cinema over stage acting but more often than not I find myself impressed by the TW acting chop on display Usually I dislike monologue because I find them a sign of lazy writing but I generally not bothered by them in the series and they delivered fairly well I think I just nope out of any other show that had this degree of monologuing but I can forgive TW Though I enjoyed most of the acting I seen and don have a favorite performer yet the guy from Time Enough At Last really stood out to me Partly due to the quirkiness of the character itself Are there any performance you particularly enjoyed,Is it my imagination or is the acting pretty stellar in TW Do you have any favorite actor from the series
970,hjd204,TwilightZone,Not sure if this ha been discussed before Please state who should be narrator of new cbs all access twilight zone revival series My choice Anthony hopkins Morgan freeman Christopher walken Michael caine,New twilight zone narrator Who should do narration

972,MrFack,TwilightZone,Do you think when Rod wrote this he intended Franklin melt down to be funny Every time I watch this I think of how bad this is I mean the guy spends his last dime and probably put his wife out on the street What do you guy think,I have an old series question about the episode The Fever
973,choozer,TwilightZone,Hopefully I not the oldest person on this sub weeps softly so maybe someone can share their experience with TZ now v watching it when they were much younger Things I noticed 1 there sure are a lot of harpy wife character I see hardly this type of character now in modern television 2 that slot machine episode is hilarious now v freaky when when I wa a kid 3 acting is overall very good No idea what wa good or bad acting when I wa a kid 4 moral issue are fairly clear cut in the series People are good decent or rotten The moral ambiguity of today television is much stronger 5 TZ debuted 10 year after WW2 8 year after the beginning of the Cold War and 10 year before the moon landing It shed an interesting light on the series how Serling saw other planet extraterrestrial life war and the potential for a nuclear holocaust 6 I remember being terrified by Little Girl Lost and how that gave me nightmare for year Haven rewatched it yet wonder if I just going to roll my eye at my young self or not 7 I don remember ever cry during a TZ episode a a child Actually sniffled a little during some the episode I rewatched,Fans who are old enough to have seen TZ during their younger year anything you see differently now that you didn back then
974,SebastianBah,TwilightZone,I have looked up all over internet and could not find the name of this episode I saw it when I wa a kid and all I can remember is that it wa about a normal family that figure out they are trapped inside the house with something like wall blocking all door and exit They even try to use their car to breakout the garage without success At the end they where in a doll house with gum on it our something What is the name of this episode,Family trapped in doll house episode name
975,Fatallys,TwilightZone,Expect for Dailymotion I can find any episode to watch Does anyone know a website to watch it in French or in English with subtitle Thanks,Hello there I would like to know where u guy are going to watch this show
976,cicibellis4life,TwilightZone,In the episode he get tired of Leila and feel overburdened by her There could be ton of possibility to avoid feeling constantly nagged It may not be quite the same power a Gregory West ha in creating people from a tape recording but can come close Imagine having someone on your beck and call willing to do all of your annoying and mundane errand Need someone to clean your rain gutter alphabetize your office form etc Need someone to pick up your dry cleaning and two major highway are closed You now have someone to sit in traffic while you relax at home And you would still have a hot woman to play with and go on date when you actually in the mood,I would want to be Roger Shackleford in The Chaser
977,SmegmaSangwich,TwilightZone,Hello My friend and I have been hard at work trying to make a Twilight Zone podcast I not sure if this kind of post is allowed here but we really tried to put together the best podcast we can but we are well aware that it is not perfect We plan on watching every episode and making a podcast episode on each one Please listen and let u know what you think,Twilight Zoners Podcast Attempt Please give feedback and criticism
978,cicibellis4life,TwilightZone,I have a younger cousin who is learning sign language He can hear perfectly he just want to work with people with disability I wa wondering for the twilight zone series which episode would you find most interesting on mute This mean you just watching the show with no sound and no caption You have to follow the episode purely on visual effect and sight I would enjoy seeing Perchance to Dream and Walking Distance on mute Both rely heavily on visual effect so the episode isn impossible to follow You would also notice some imagery better like the funhouse and other carnival scene in Perchance to Dream Walking Distance ha wonderful imagery of the small town of Homewood and you could still follow Martin a he visit all of his childhood hang out spot You can still see the band concert merry go round park scene the house the ice cream shop etc The only thing you would really miss would be the final father and son conversation You wouldn hear the one summer to a customer line and the father telling Martin to look ahead instead of behind But the imagery would be just a nostalgic and poignant Watching an episode without picture is basically a radio drama So no visual imagery just audio I would pick The Jungle A Piano in the House and The Lonely The first two are self explanatory due to the sound and music effect that are prevalent in both episode I would enjoy hearing the drum lion roaring and voodoo sound in The Jungle A Piano in the House would allow you to focus more on the song and background music accompanying them It would be interesting to see how people reaction and emotion to the song would be described The Lonely is something I chose because of the isolation factor How the struggle of complete isolation can wear down a person is difficult to describe without showing it You can see Corry breaking down from boredom And the contrast in emotion when Alicia arrives and Corry form an attachment to her even though he is fully aware that she is a robot Then we get the final scene where Alicia is shot and Corry world is shattered even though he ha been pardoned and can return to Earth The twist and turn this episode take would be interesting to hear and all done without any imagery,Best episode to watch without sound or picture
979,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,Some example The first nurse face is visible The doctor face when he talking to his nurse in his office is visible Leader face is visible when we first see him on the flat screen TV In truth in almost every shot where shadow are suppose to be concealing people face they don their face are clearly visible Either this is because of HD or the fact that Heyes didn try enough to conceal these people face Personally I think it a bit of both,Does it bother you that oftentimes you can clearly see people face in Eye of the Beholder when you not suppose to
980,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,1 If you were in the episode would you rather raise Billy Mumy temper and go to the Cornfield knowing that you had done the right thing or stay with him a his slave and serve his every maniacal whim without batting an eye 2 What the Heck is the Cornfield 3 If you look at this episode from the perspective of the adult it a very depressing episode with a very depressing ending but if you look at the episode from the perspective of Billy Mumy it a very happy episode with a very happy ending 4 Once Billy Mumy sends everybody to the Cornfield for disobeying will he get bored or lonely and maybe realize that world domination isn his forte What will he do once he gotten rid of everybody Should there be a sequel about it with adult Billy Mumy wandering around Peaksville starving to death because he made it snow and ruined all the crop 5 If you living in a nightmarish Hellscape ruled by a kid who hate singing and it your husband birthday then the WORST TWO POSSIBLE PRESENTS YOU COULD GET HIM are a bottle of whiskey to make him forget that his life is in danger and a record with lot of singing on it that he used to like prior to the rise of the Satan child and will want to play immediately These two present are bad enough on top of the fact that your Husband birthday is a day where the Satan child is not the center of attention 6 The only character I like in this episode is Dan because he the only one who end the facade and act like a real person and make the very logical assumption that Billy Mumy could easily be knocked unconscious with a heavy household object and that his demise could result in the restoration of humanity a they know it or at least the return of order to responsible mind Every other character is an unlikable sissy Dan go to the cornfield with a smile on his face which is more than a few Twilight Zone character can say,6 thing I thought about while watching that Billy Mumy episode
981,jmohthreeohthree,TwilightZone,The police officer who chase down Old Ben bear striking resemblance to description of Men in Black Reported MIB encounter peaked sometime in the 50 or 60 so it wouldn be surprising if Serling gave a nod to the phenomenon I trying to find out if this is the first onscreen depiction of MIB but it seems likely Also anyone else get wrapped up in the Star Wars parallel A kid Aunt guardian repeatedly scold the precocious whippersnapper for hanging out with a weird old magic guy LITERALLY NAMED OLD BEN Instead of dying he vanishes into thin air and a Obi Wan promised he come back more powerful than you can possibly imagine a king in this case And although it flipped chronologically he take Jenny away from her home where she ha always felt out of place to a frickin adventure in space This is freaking me out man,Is The Fugitive the first onscreen depiction of Men in Black Also did George Lucas rip off Rod
982,CreswellLane,TwilightZone,I been looking for show similar to TZ because I just love the way people act and the general world view of people from back then and I also really like the bad and whimsical special special effect for some reason I just started Star Trek the original version which is on Netflix a few day ago and I already 9 episode in I think the show are similar in a lot of way Give it a shot if you haven t,If you like TZ I would highly recommend giving Star Trek a shot

984,choozer,TwilightZone,Background I watched TW religiously when I wa a kid but don remember the majority of them other than the one that were cult classic Talking Tina the Hitchhiker etc It a real pleasure going through these now Even though some are overly heavy handed with the moralizing the show ha a real sense of humanity to it that I haven seen in most TV now or then Serling focus on a lot of character who wouldn get much attention otherwise the town drunk the aging actress the kind sidewalk vendor It nice to see character type that are routinely sidelined be the focus of their own episode I really loathe reboots but I think TW might be an exception since some of the effect are pretty dated If Jordan Peele keep the concise dialogue and spirit of TW I gladly rewatch these again Serling wa a fantastic writer Watching Where is Everybody wa interesting given the moon landing occurred 10 year later In fact every episode that involves the past or future is interesting because it from the point of view of Serling in the 60 Walking Distance for example gave me a bit of a ride because it a late 50 view of the 20 Anyway I think I have 38473874 episode left Glad there are so many,Having a TZ marathon right now Only on episode S1 6 Some random thought if you indulge me

994,cicibellis4life,TwilightZone,It stated in the episode that the Kanamits communicate telepathically through some type of brain wave Instead of verbally like how human do I guessing their language wa more complex than any that wa present on Earth at the time It would seem almost impossible to know where to begin There no way of knowing if their word structure ha any similarity to a written language on Earth The language could have easily been something that if translated correctly would be full of word describing object and idea which have never manifested itself on our planet and would not be intelligible to human It could have been describing thing that were only present on the Kanamits planet I enjoy the episode very much but found it unlikely that the language could be translated at a pretty quick pace,How do the UN interpreter decipher the Kanamits alien language in To Serve Man

997,petitecolier,TwilightZone,Are there any writer who specialize in short fiction that similar to Twilight Zone in spirit and concept The closest I seen are the Hugo Award Anthologies but that obviously hit or miss and all sci fi based I believe Dave Eggers also writes short story that are speculative fiction but I looking for something a little darker and creepier if that make sense,Twilight Zonish short story

1003,cicibellis4life,TwilightZone,I rewatched Ring a Ding Girl a couple of night ago I noticed when Bud is reading the newspaper before Bunny arrives the headline say Jockey banned from race track I believe this same headline appeared in one of the newspaper in Last Night Of A Jockey In the beginning when Grady is banned from horse racing and before he make his wish to become big Also the same staircase is used in both Time Enough at Last and A Nice Place to Visit What are some other obscure thing you noticed,Most obscure thing you noticed in an episode
1004,DashZanger,TwilightZone,I have seen spoiler from a few episode though but majority of the series is still unknown to me I have also seen Black Mirror and it is my third favorite television series of all time I have heard it very similar to Twilight Zone I imagine it just like Bane said in The Dark Knight Rises Now is not the time for fear That come later,Planning to binge watch the entire series in about a month time Any advice to keep me mentally sane
1005,Tristan_Booth,TwilightZone,The SyFy schedule ha finally been posted up through the 4th and there doesn appear to be a TZ marathon I realize that not everyone care about this but if you do www syfy com feedback or feedback syfy com,No Marathon
1006,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,OK this is a minor problem I admit But I just don get it Every episode every single one Rod show up right next to the character he talking about It an interesting way to frame a narrative and bring all the episode together in a sense Rod is the only consistent character and his iconic style of narration is unparalleled but why is he everywhere talking aabout people without them noticing Take his other series Night Gallery The narration make a lot more sense He run a creepy art museum and he uncovers painting and each painting is connected to a certain creepy story I can get that It a good way of universe building But with Twilight Zone on the other hand he never explains what he doing there It not creepy really Just weird When he just on a street or something in a crowded urban area it not too unsettling but I can think of lot of time where this form of narration is unpractical in The Fear for instance the lady is talking about how she scared of sound on her roof It a very dramatic scene Then not like ten foot from the main character in the very same house Rod is talking about the episode right in front of her fireplace He scarier than anything up on the roof in that case The only time I can recall when he break this form is in the creepy Billy Mumy episode He talking about how Billy Mumy ha caused most of the United States to disappear and he just in front of a blank background pointing to a map A kind of proto Night Gallery if you will He also in front of the same blank background in each next episode promo But he never doe that for his intro only for his outros Don get me wrong it a very dramatic and unique way to narrate It nostalgic and it parodied a lot and nothing like it ha been done since I love it I just don get it It an interesting way to handle it Rod Serling I suppose want to be a character in his own work of art without interfering with the main character but if he trying to build a sort of universe where he serf a an ever present prophetic invulnerable diety then I need an explanation that all Just some kind of explanation Take The Outer Limits It ha a consistent form of narration and like in The Twilight Zone it a unique way of introducing a show But unlike The Twilight Zone it ha a backstory Aliens have invaded your TV and they showing you stuff not much of a backstory but it get the point across very simple but a little exposition In Twilight Zone we given no explanation a to how Rod can break through wall into safe into restaurant into outer space We given no explanation a to what the Heck he doing there or why none of the other character see him I don think he playing an alien or something He just Rod Serling average guy very audible voice Is he invisible Is he a ghost Maybe the pilot should have had him drink an invisibility potion or something Anyway that what I got Any reason behind the way he decides to narrate his stuff It almost funny I swear Even if he trying to be completely deadpan straight it still funny It a weird way to narrate something when we could just hear his voice Any answer,The way Roddy show up EVERYWHERE

1010,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,OK I sure ya know this one In season 4 Episode 14 Mr Feathersmith is a rich jerk he buy out all his competitor and drive a bunch of people to ruin After he demolished his last competitor life he get bored about how thing are He realizes that getting rich is more fun than just being rich He talk it over with Mr Hecate the elderly janitor while he drunk and bored Mr Hecate remark that both he and Mr Feathersmith are from Cliffordville Indiana and by a strange coincidence one of them is a janitor and one of them is a zillionaire Mr Feathersmith go to the elevator It doesn take him to the ground floor though it take him to this incredibly bizarre tacky travel agency run by Ms Devlin who clearly just a female version of Satan played by Julie Newmar Catwoman from the old Batman show She say that Mr Feathersmith is bored so he can go back to Cliffordville and experience all the joy of building it up again Mr Feathersmith is gullible and isn the least bit fazed by the fact that he talking to the LITERAL EMBODIMENT OF EVIL so he agrees and give up his entire fortune on one time travel trip because he think that nothing will go wrong Yeah right and even tell Ms Devlin that he not a sucker and that she not going to trick him in any way She say that because of his past behavior he doesn even have to pay his soul because they already have it and he going to go to Hell no matter what At this point you think Mr Feathersmith would cry like a baby maybe repent and the episode would be over but Nope he go ahead and Ms Devlin transport him back to Cliffordville around the turn of the century so he can relive his entire life all over again Mr Feathersmith make a deal he think he got everything and he buy up the land where he know there oil but a it turn out it the turn of the century and the technology is so crappy that they can reach the oil because it buried too deep Mr Feathersmith walk out in disgust and then try to tell people that they can help him out but nobody buy it Ms Devlin tell him that he all washed up but he can go back to his own time if he ha forty buck It just so happens that the deed to his land add up to forty buck so he sell them to a younger version of Hecate and get on the train Then in the closing scene Hecate is portrayed a a rich jerk and Mr Feathersmith is the janitor and Mr Hecate is a jerk to Mr Feathersmith just like Mr Feathersmith wa a jerk to Hecate when he wa the janitor Mr Hecate gloat over how he got his start from the deed that Mr Feathersmith gave him and then the episode over I have a few question about this Lots in fact OK the first one the one that come to mind the easiest is this Ms Devlin told Mr Feathersmith that he wa going to Hell no matter what because he wa a rich jerk and drove lot of people to suicide It a new spin on the old soul selling trope They already got his soul there nothing he can do about it We know one thing about the world of this episode Greedy people go to Hell Nice people on the other hand like Mr Hecate the old janitor presumably go to Heaven for being so nice and helpful and everything Now here my question if Ms Devlin switch their role around so that Mr Hecate is the rich jerk and Mr Feathersmith is the poor janitor wouldn Mr Hecate go to Hell and wouldn Mr Feathersmith go to Heaven They have after all reversed role Here another question If Ms Devlin wa out to show Mr Feathersmith the error of his way and show him that greedy people always end up in Hell and ruin the world is she doing the world a favor to replace him with an equally vicious snarky tycoon Nothing changed except their role after all Now Hecate ha the monopoly instead of Hecate now he sitting at the top of the heap but ha Ms Devlin really taught anybody anything Mr Feathersmith might have gotten some hard knock sure But Hecate ha learned that greed and hatred always pay off Which isn the moral Ms Devlin set the event of the episode in place so if Hecate ha grown fat and rich off of his ill gotten gain because Mr Feathersmith just had to sell those deed Ms Devlin hasn really done anything She just replaced one greedy millionaire with another If you watch the episode from Mr Feathersmith perspective he learned a lesson But if you watch the episode from Hecate perspective the exact opposite is true He hasn learned a thing about greed He just a much of a jerk a Mr Feathersmith and he got that way because of Ms Devlin Here something else to think about what if Mr Hecate get bored with being rich Would he wander down to the elevator into Ms Devlin travel office then make the same mistake and end up having to sell HIS bond back to Mr Feathersmith to get back to his won time Would they end up selling the deed off to one another in a kind of infinite loop forever trading place Has a lesson really been learned or ha Ms Devlin set off an inevitable chain of event where they perpetually grow tired of their rich go back make a mistake and give their fortune to the other Who can say The message of the episode seems to be that rich people only become rich because of coincidence but Ms Devlin is no coincidence She orchestrated the whole thing Who know if the event portrayed in the episode are really the beginning of it all What if there were infinite janitor Feathersmiths and infinite millionaire Hecates before what we see And after too It boggles the mind You really have to put this into perspective At the beginning of the story Mr Feathersmith is going to Hell no matter what Ms Devlin say so because he lived a vicious mean spirited life and he ha to pay cash instead of his soul But by making them reverse role won Mr Hecate go to Hell And won Mr Feathersmith the nice kindly janitor go up to the Pearly Gates for having 40 year of service and gaining his gold watch in the process The ending of the episode might seem sad but really Mr Feathersmith is the winner because clearly the world of the episode ha some notion of Heaven and Hell Does Ms Devlin think that Mr Feathersmith ha suffered enough trying to convince the two Cliffordville mechanic that they can build a motor only to have them laugh in his face It doesn seem like the Devil would have too much compassion for a protagonist a loathsome a Feathersmith But what she done essentially by messing up time is given Mr Hecate a spot in Hell because of Mr Feathersmith foolish choice to travel backward into time and she given Mr Feathersmith an undeserved spot in Heaven that ignores his action before he gave Mr Hecate the deed back It seems a if he loses but he really doe win in the end because he no longer a jerk Here how I think the episode could have ended a little better Let say that Mr Feathersmith make a fool of himself back at the turn of the century He goof around He becomes a laughing stock among the townsfolk and nobody will give him a decent job even if he begs for it He declared a lunatic and get thoroughly ostracized by the member of his community In the end he become destitute and ha to eat scrap off the road He lost and he won ever regain his fortune and not only that but he living in the wrong time with no Ms Devlin in sight The end See No alteration in Hecate life just his own Hecate let say decides to be a janitor like he did before and work for a similar millionaire but this millionaire is le harsh a bit more forgiving le cutthroat kinder to his hard working employee It could even be Mr Dietrich Feathersmith chief competitor in the present timeline just for the sake of argument Hecate doesn end up making a complete fortune but he end up in the middle class with a decent janitor income and a great family Feathersmith remains poor get into drinking and commits suicide and still go to Hell Now THERE S a good ending Justice is given out Nobody switch place but the ending is satisfying and all the piece of the puzzle are put in place Less sloppy There are still a few minor detail of this episode worth going over For one Mr Feathersmith is a little too calm when Ms Devlin take off her hat and reveals her two horn she doesn even try to act casual about it and he isn even bothered in the least I also wonder why Mr Feathersmith would give up his two deed just to be back in the present day he went back to Cliffordville for the rustic nostalgic charm so couldn he keep the deed and make his fortune in some other way He could work a a fry cook until a better oil drill is developed in fact that why Hecate becomes a millionaire at the end because he wa more patient and hung on to the deed until a suitable time There are more way to gain wealth than just by buying an oil field and if Mr Feathersmith wa going to build up his money in the exact same way then why go at all If he not even going to put a little creativity into it why not just stay in the present He also apparently rather go back to the present day where he older than stay in the past and be optimistic about his situation I mean he give up his worldly possession just to go back to the sixty What so great about the sixty Sure they had better medicine and stuff but also more pollution and le opportunity to make money which is why Mr Feathersmith went back in time to begin with The last gripe I have with the episode is the way in which Ms Devlin trick Mr Feathersmith He say he want to look the same when he go back into the past so she make him look the same but she keep his real age the same so he still old and far le agile It supposed to be a loophole I know and it meant to prove that The Devil always find a loophole somewhere but she say that his inside are the same and only his outside are different Who to say where the outside end and the inside begin Are his teeth still rotted What if he went to the local Cliffordville doctor He be treated a a medical anomaly Apart from that this is a good episode The makeup is superb the actor are terrific and wholly believable and it an interesting way to handle the whole time travel concept These are some problem I have with it Can you answer them,Of Late I Think About The Episode About Cliffordville

1014,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,I love The After Hours honestly Great episode I can get enough of it The plot great the character are convincing the twist knock the wind out of you I seen it lot and lot of time But recently I rewatched it and I noticed one tiny little quirk in it Just one tiny little quirk that I don really get So there the scene where Marsha go to the manager of the store or whatever and she say that she got the gold thimble on the ninth floor The manager tell her that the store doesn have a ninth floor Now that all fine and good I get that But I have to wonder here if there is no ninth floor and human can access it and only mannequin can go up there then where doe the store get it mannequin The manager say to Marsha that there is no ninth floor period If the ninth floor is where the mannequin hang out and chill then the store would have to get them from up there Instead of telling Marsha that there no ninth floor maybe he could say Well we DO have a ninth floor but it a storage space where we store mannequin and stuff and it not accessible to customer That would make sense That would fix the whole thing Let say that the store just go up to the ninth floor whenever they need some new mannequin and the mannequin pretend like they not alive when the store sends somebody up to get them That would make sense I mean the ninth floor certainly doe RESEMBLE some kind of storage space being so empty and desolate and all The store clearly isn in on the whole living mannequin thing at least not so far a we can tell The guy at the end is weirded out by how the mannequin resembles Marsha They don know that their mannequin are alive or that they live on a floor that doesn exist Those mannequin have to come from somewhere they have to be put away somewhere when they not being used The guy in charge of mannequin being human would have to go somewhere that doesn really exist every time he went to get some mannequin That a little nutty Every store ha some spot where they put mannequin when they not in use Maybe the ninth floor is just a storage space but it ha to be somewhere that human can access Every store ha some sort of mannequin circulation I know that for a fact I can accept living mannequin that awesome But I just can accept that the store isn aware of where their mannequin come from that they come straight out of a spatial paradox Any answer,The After Hours plothole

1037,2001_with_dinosaurs,TwilightZone,I thought it wa pretty good but the ending SPOILERS strained credulity How did Landau character who wa in the airport at the time know that those two would bother checking out the room let alone that they be there at the precise time he called I think the premise wa good but the initial conversation between Landau and John van Dreelen could have been significantly shortened The real interest arrives through the scene pf Landau nervously checking the room for the bomb Had they committed to that side of the story in greater detail and revised the peculiar ending this might have ended up a true classic As it is it a well done story with fine perfornances and visuals and brief section of suspense which while excellent also suggest the unfulfilled promise of the premise,Thoughts on The Jeopardy Room
1038,cicibellis4life,TwilightZone,I recently watched Walking Distance again To me the father son chat on the merry go round wa touching and heartfelt The concept of childhood magic being finite and happening only once in your life The one summer to every customer line And the idea that we all grow up and slowly leave it behind What are some scene from any episode that you find emotional or touching,Most poignant heartfelt moment
1039,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,This should be pretty obvious They almost the same episode Now I not saying it a bad concept It a great concept And both episode are equally good I just don think they should both have been made Whichever one wa the second one that one shouldn have been made It really just overkill OK bear with me here while I point out all the similarity Normal seeming setting group of people Strange occurrence lead to suspicion of alien in the area People are completely isolated and can go anywhere Paranoia start in Weird thing start happening People start pointing finger at one another The conflict end Then the real alien is revealed The end Those are a heck of a lot of coincidence The only thing that set them apart really is that on Maple Street the paranoia go a little further As I recall Maple Street came first That make the diner one seem completely extraneous although I have to admit I do appreciate that real cool third eye at the end That one of the only thing in the whole series that really scared me Other than that though it seems like they took the same idea and repeated it twice Any reason why they would do that,The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street is practically the same a Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up
1040,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,1 Living Doll 2 The Hitch hiker 3 Nightmare at 20 000 Feet 4 Night Call 5 Perchance to Dream 6 The After Hours 7 Little Girl Lost 8 The Midnight Sun 9 Elegy 10 Mirror Image Nice to see very underrated episode like Perchance to Dream and Elegy showcased And I think The Hitch hiker deserves it high ranking that episode is legitimately terrifying even after sixty hour though while good episode I would omit Nightmare and Little Girl and replace them with the more subtle horror of Shadow Play And When The Sky Was Opened and A World of Difference Still pretty good list overall What do you think about their list Do you agree with it,Watch Mojo released today their pick for the creepiest TZ episode ever
1041,FunShadow87,TwilightZone,I start a small list here and I gradually build onto it a I get suggestion From Agnes With Love The Brain Center at Whipple The Lateness Of The Hour A Thing About Machines,Twilight Zone Episodes about Technology
1042,bw_pro2020,TwilightZone,Seen this episode a dozen time but just noticed when she asking about the weather and the sky in the opening scene when asked about the cloud the nurse reply I never wa much for staring up at the sky They have pig face and the anatomy of a pig neck make it physically impossible for them to look up at the sky,Funny line I just caught in Eye of the Beholder spoiler
1043,2001_with_dinosaurs,TwilightZone,Spoilers about the episode ahead While I just put a spoiler warning I prefer it if no spoiler were shared I did however read my cable box guide description of the episode which indicates the Devil is involved in the story I wonder if that wa supposed to be one of the episode surprise Anyway should I read Beaumont 1960 short story before checking out the episode Perhaps I should read all of Beaumont story before viewing their corresponding eps Is there a good collection that you can recommend I heard the latest one Penguin Perchance to Dream and Other Stories IIRC is lacking or disappointing due to the absence of many Beaumont best story,Charles Beaumont The Howling Man Should I read the short story first or watch the episode
1044,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,OK so this ha bugged me for a long time The Midnight Sun is about a future where the Earth ha moved just about an inch or two closer to the Sun right And it make everything become all hot and terrible But here my problem Rod Serling in the introduction say that There is no Night Anymore That not hyperbole one of the aspect of this episode is that there REALLY IS NO NIGHT I not sure how this could happen The episode never mention the Earth completely stopping it daily spin on it axis just getting closer to the sun but even if it did stop spinning on it axis which is an event that unlikely to happen in exact synchronization with the Earth moving closer to The Sun mind you there would still be night One side of Earth would be lit up forever and one side would be dark forever In that case humanity could just move to the dark side or if the dark side wa too cold they could live in between the two zone Either way regardless of whether the Earth stop spinning or not there is no way that everybody would be basked in perpetual daylight The people over in China wouldn be facing the same predicament they be having a continuous night Maybe a warm night sure but a night nonetheless This is really just simple astronomy A body of light like the Sun can light up the whole Earth at once even if it wa closer It could only light up half the Earth For there to be constant lighting over the whole Earth there would have to be multiple sun multiple light source and thee episode never mention that So how in the world can something like this happen Please don answer this with Oh it just fantasy it doesn have to make sense Fantasy doe have to make sense in some respect I can figure out how something like this could happen The only answer I think is lousy screenwriting That all I can think of really They just didn realize that no matter how horrible a predicament like this would be there simply no way that every single inch of the Earth could be perpetually bathed in sunlight It just can happen Or can it Let me know in the comment below,How doe The Midnight Sun work
1045,cicibellis4life,TwilightZone,Which character have name that relate to their identity or action in the episode they appear in Here are some of mine Henry J Fate Obviously his potion tonic and other item he peddles affect the fate or destiny of the people that purchase them I also love when he talk to Denton before the showdown and offer him the potion for free saying it a reminder for the time fate stepped in That line wa perfect Romney Wordsworth Being a librarian in a society where book are banned by the dictatorship state He wa true to his passion even reading the Bible minute before the bomb in his room wa set to explode A Bible that possession of wa punishable by death Comfort Gatewood She stood by Jeff Mrytlebank side after he mysteriously awoke from his supposed death When the town believed he wa some kind of sorcerer They ended up getting married and staying in the town instead of being run off so I assume she provided him lot of comfort later on in life together,Descriptive character name
1046,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,The Hunt is a bad episode Not just bad it fails in pretty much every department I can relate to the protagonist the plot is cliche and furthermore it just doesn make any sense Allow me to give you a brief overview This hillbilly life with his wife in a little cabin and he a hunting maniac so he go out into the forest one night with his dog He dy but doesn realize it somehow and then he go back to his cabin and find that he become an invisible ghost He never try to pick anything up and signal to anybody that he there and he so dense that for five minute or so he can tell that he dead even though he see his own grave being dug After this he venture off into the wood again and come across an eternal fence which serf a the entrance to the afterlife He see a gate and the guy at the gate say that it lead into Heaven and that he can come in and that there nothing else outside the gate The hillbilly decides not to enter because they don allow dog and he ha his dog with him He go further on and find a second gate and there an angel there who say that the first gate wa actually Hell that THIS one is Heaven and that he can come in with his dog and live there happily ever after Now here the flaw The devil LIES The devil lie That my problem with this one The Devil say that HELL is HEAVEN I don think he should be allowed to do that I think that God should give him a good going over Think about how twisted this situation is for a moment If that guy hadn brought his dog with him he would have been burned up for all eternity EVEN THOUGH HE HADN T SINNED WHEN HE WAS ALIVE Is it just me or is that unjust There are lot of evil people in the world doe Satan really need to TRICK people into being burnt up I don think he should do that I think Satan need to have some limit Take for example the hour long episode where Burgess Meredith is Satan He probably the best Satan in the whole series He devious and cunning and he light crooked cigar with his finger Consider the scene where Pengy try to get the owner of the newspaper to sign his soul over with a contract The contract is very blunt It say in plain lettering that the guy is supposed to give Burgess his soul in exchange for good newspaper story There no beating around the bush Burgess doe try to deny his being the Devil I admit but he also admits that if the guy doesn sign the contract then there nothing he can do about it he just leave and the guy will be alone again People have to make deal with the Devil willingly or the Devil is a cheater Very simple really God ha put certain restriction certain limitation on the Devil to ensure that he doesn catch anybody off guard Satan cannot lie and his victim have to be OK with it Burgess Meredith fulfills that description perfectly He actually believable a the Devil Not so with the guy in The Hunt Now I have to ask you why would Satan lie to the poor hillbilly guy I don think Satan is entitled to do that It would be OK maybe if Satan said This is Hell yeah but it really isn a bad a people make it out to be it really very fun Then if the hillbilly guy entered the gate THEN Satan would be allowed to burn him up I think for falling for it But Satan just flat out LIES And that wrong What sort of crumby afterlife allows Hell to disguise itself a Heaven and then punish people who did nothing Heck what can be certain What if the Heaven at the end the second gate is really Hell How doe this afterlife work Why doe Satan get to do that I think that God should I dunno discus some ground rule with Satan here and tell him that coaxing innocent people into his gate is a no no Seriously I just don get this episode Why doe Satan get to do this Can anybody explain it,I don like The Hunt
1047,timelessasinfinity,TwilightZone,Whenever I watch the original I also have to screen the John Lithgow remake too Both are fantastic True the remake omits some pertinent detail our protagonist in Lithgow version for instance is merely afraid of flying while in the original he just been released from a sanitarium after suffering from a nervous breakdown on a plane six month prior wa he harassed by a creature only he could seemingly see then too but it more than make up for that by besting the original in it creature design and wisely confining it like Freddy Krueger in the original Elm Street movie largely to the shadow Also the remake depicts what the original couldn owing I guess to budget constraint the cabin depressurizing a a result of someone shooting out a window or in the original releasing the emergency door while the plane is in flight And finally in the original we mostly spend time with Bob his wife and the crew We never get acquainted with the other passenger In the remake we get a feel for some of the other personality traveling with our protagonist and how it might be like for them to have to deal with someone who is totally wigging out in the middle of a storm Oh and one of the passenger is a little girl who is surprisingly not annoying at all She given some pretty amusing line including what is possibly the best line after the iconic There a man on the wing of this plane You big fella you used to be a normal person,The Lithgow version or the Shatner version of Nightmare at 20 000 Feet

1070,cicibellis4life,TwilightZone,The twilight zone is probably most well known for it twist or surprise ending But which one do you think don fit an episode or which episode could be better provide more justice to the character if the ending were different Steel I had thought the twist ending would be that the Maynard Flash the more powerful robot boxer the B7 would turn out to be a human too The new ending would be that the law prohibiting human boxing is repealed and Steel vow to get stronger to resume his former prizefighting career and defeat the Maynard Flash in an eventual rematch Night Call I don feel this episode needed a twist I think the more justifiable ending would be that Elva Keene finally find peace in her life and make amends with her dead husband over the phone She promise to not bos him around once she pass on and join him in the afterlife What are your thought,Twist ending you would change to better an episode

1073,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,This seems to be a fan favorite among most and I used to like it but I always felt like something wa a little off about it Now I know what wrong with it As a kid I accepted it without questioning it passing it off a a simple story about an alien invasion with a killer punchline Now though I know just how corny and awful it is It a good episode in it own right but trust me once you see the source material you get why I hate it I saw a book a while back called The Best of Damon Knight It wa from 1976 and I usually don buy sci fi book but I noticed it had about 20 different story in there so I got it There wa an introduction about this guy Damon Knight and he wa born in Oregon I guess and he open each story with a small introduction and then go on The story I noticed were very satirical in nature Which is to say they were allegory not intended to be taken seriously I noticed that one of them wa called To Serve Man I wa intrigued I thought maybe it had something to do with the Twilight Zone episode As it turn out it doe Rod Serling ripped the story wholesale off this poor guy Sure he paid him so it legal but he messed up the core message of the whole thing The story beat the episode in a lot of way For one the story is funny Dark humor sure but humor nonetheless Damon Knight wrote lot of funny and inventive sci fi story They all just big joke Backward O Time is so funny it should be made into a comedy movie Anyway the episode is treated so heavy handed that when trying to discern the true meaning of the whole thing I thought it wa a metaphor for Communism Turns out it not a metaphor for Communism it really just a story about alien that cook people according to Damon Knight In To Serve Man the story the Kanamits look like pig And it funny and it make a statement because you know pig eating people Funny right As a metter of fact on the cover of my Damon Knight book there a drawing of two Kanamits looking at a book written in some ancient language presumably and they look like they were taken out of a cartoon with Teletubbie type overall In the episode they aren even slightly laughable in appearance Instead of being little pig people they tall morbid guy that look like Lurch from The Addams Family Their image a it wa supposed to be wa ruined forever by this one show The next thing that get me is the character In the episode there a guy and he work for the United Nations Same with the story But in the story he a bachelor In the episode he ha a girlfriend a love interest who completely unnecessary her only reason is to say the punchline at the end In the story he ha this friend And this friend I think is absolutely essential In the story the friend talk about how he suspect that the Kanamits have ulterior motif and how nobody would solve all world hunger and war if they didn want something in return This one friend of the protagonist make the story a lot more believable In the episode they don even bother to check the Kanamits out They just go right ahead and start letting them fix everything This friend in the story who completely absent in the episode give a different viewpoint and show that in a case like this where freakin ALIENS arrive on Earth some people would be skeptical about them In the episode they don even make a fuss That friend make everything more realistic MOST of the human race can be stupid and give in just not ALL And the ending bug me In the story when the friend say the punchline they not about to abducted and captured they talking thing over in a restaurant so they still have time to stop the alien and get their planet back In the episode his love interest say the punchline when they close the door over him and he dy no matter what In the story you nervously chuckle In the episode you just groan In short the Twilight Zone is normally praised for it inventive twist and people always seem to really praise the twist in this one although that praise isn deserved since Rod Serling never even came up with it to begin with I highly prefer the Damon Knight version and I suggest you read it too and see which one you prefer It a good twist but Damon Knight came up with it and he should have been able to execute it the way he saw fit That all I have to say,I don like To Serve Man
1074,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,This episode is highly overrated Everybody know it It regarded a a pioneer of the post apocalyptic genre and an episode with a stunning never to be expected twist But what I don like about it is that it doesn make any sense and nobody seems to get that First off I love Burgess Meredith I have nothing against him His acting in this is great Top notch I liked him in the one where he holed up in his apartment and he forced to die because he like book That one great He also good a Penguin He actually the only villain I like on Batman His rendition of Penguin is incredible Best Penguin portrayal ever I don like Danny DeVito He just can beat Burgy So this review isn directed towards Burgess It based on the plot WE open the episode in a bank where Burgess is reading a book His bos come up and say that he stink a a person and he shouldn read so much David Copperfield He tell him that he suck at his job and if he keep reading dumb book then he be fired After that he go home and try to relax but his vain screaming wife tell him that his book suck She vandalizes them throw them in the trash tear the page out He begs her not to but she mentally assault him and threatens to get a divorce So then Mr Bemis like any sane person would do go down to the bank vault to read alone away from the jerk who pick on him for being a nerdy literary guy The bomb go off and he go outside and he think Oh wow I free from my stupid bos and my nagging wife Yay So he go around in the rubble and he get to a library and he about to read forever and enjoy his life forever and then he break his glass That it End of episode Fade to black What people fail to notice is that the moral is HORRIBLY SKEWED The whole episode I feel nothing but pity for him Why do his glass break That not justice that frickin torture What is the moral That a guy can read book peacefully if he want to That he should have been NICE to his fat bos and his evil yelling wife That he should have been a soulless conformist This episode is just sad The episode should just end when his wife and bos get killed there Justice served The moral could be Don be mean to poor Burgess Meredith when he just want to read Can he be an introvert if he want to be an introvert Nope I don get the moral here I don get it The Obsolete man the other one he in praise the use of book This one seems to be anti book That pretty contradictory Here how I think the whole episode could be improved They made his wife and bos complete jerk and made him a sweet completely likeable sympathetic character If they were going to make the moral that he shouldn have been such a bookworm then that fine They just need to make HIM the bad guy Maybe his bos could have said that the business wa failing that he had built the bank out of the ground with his bare hand and Bemis is so lost in his book that he worth a much a a statue Then Mr Bemis could throw the book in his bos face and say F you The episode doesn make him a jerk It make him a cuddly nerd In the next scene his wife could come home and beg for him to pay a little more attention to her and he could push her aside and go over to his armchair and read and not listen to her and be a total asshat That would give a reason for him to break his glass But freak she a likable and charismatic a Norman Bates I don sympathize with HER I sympathize with HIM That what this episode doe wrong People bully this guy and then he get Justice for no reason I don get it Also the problem isn even THAT bad It seems incredibly easy to fix Earlier in the episode he find an abandoned gas station find some potato chip crunch one and say I won starve COULDN T HE FIND SOME GLASSES Some glass that were shatter resistant or in good packaging Or he could go and find some crazy glue and try to fix his glass I mean they just glass They probably not the last glass on Earth if he could find some potato chip he could feel around for some glass RIGHT Anyway that all I have to say about this one I just don get it,I don like Time Enough at Last

1076,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,I caught some flack for this little series of rant about episode I don like but I willing to keep going so keep your shirt on a I tell you just how this episode fails Everybody seems to like this one and I tend to question unanimous decision Some have even gone so far a to call this one the best episode of ALL TIME like this guy here who put it at the top of his top 10 list http www youtube com watch v X2kOSuz2VZM To begin the concept is brilliant very brilliant Kudos to the TZ people for coming up with a concept like this It wa desperately needed at a time when beauty wa highly overrated and most magazine ad were for beauty product I just think it wa poorly executed is all The makeup is good the dialogue is good My problem with the episode I guess depends on the way it wa executed I start off with the most obvious problem when running a story like this Namely the problem is that none of the doctor or nurse can show their face You might think that this seems rather obvious a their face have to stay hidden until the big reveal And it true their face DO have to stay hidden And that right there is the problem We never see their face until they get revealed That why this episode isn very good WE a an audience know something is WRONG with their face Even if we never seen the episode before we KNOW that something is being hidden that there must be some REASON for obscuring their face No other Twilight Zone episode ha all the character walk around with their face obscured in shadow That why I feel the twist doesn work Good twist have to take you by surprise Like the one with the guy on the boat who the good version of the evil Nazi guy and he try to warn everybody on the ship but they all ghost and so on That one ha a good twist Or the one with the guy who can stop time with his watch but break the watch when he robbing a bank Those are good twist Or the one where the guy asks the psychic salesman for too many thing and he give him a set of shoe and he get run over by them THOSE are good twist You never see them coming This one though you can see a twiss of some kind involving their face from a mile away It would ruin the twist to show their face but it ruin the twist to hide their face too It a loss either way That the problem with this story A few more problem Before the big reveal the script ha to fill about a half an hour so the doctor and the nurse talk about thing for a while The problem with their dialogue is that it isn even very subtle We supposed to assume that the hospital is just a normal hospital treating a lady with some kind of facial disfigurement But there are lot of point in the doctor dialogue where we feel like something is a little off Like for instance the doctor say I wish these ugly people could just live among u And the nurse say Oh no don say that you be accused of treason Right from those two line a bright viewer will catch that not only are people not ALLOWED to be ugly in this world but FREE SPEECH is illegal and you can THINK about progress or nonconformity This is clearly an Orwellian society and I just don know why when a plot relies so heavily on the viewer perceiving the hospital a a normal hospital there are so many dead giveaway Another dead giveaway come when the nurse say It time for the LEADER S MANDATORY SPEECH Not the PRESIDENT even just the LEADER Doesn that sound a lot like Big Brother Only an idiot would think that the place is a normal hospital at this point Then the nurse push a button and this HOLOGRAPHIC VIEWING SCREEN pop up on the wall Not a normal TV no but a HOLOGRAPHIC VIEWING SCREEN This is clearly in the future We can see everything from a mile away maybe before the big reveal they could just talk about I dunno normal doctor stuff That would hide the fact that the hospital isn a normal hospital My last problem with this episode might seem a little picky but it one line in the script The Nurse is in the room and she talking to the lady with the facial disfigurement and the lady say Nurse how much longer do I have to go around looking like a PIG Now this seems normal it a common insult for an ugly person But think about it for a moment EVERY PERSON in this society look a lot like a PIG It doesn matter that the pig people are considered beautiful Regardless of what the standard of beauty are at this particular moment I think even most Pig People would agree that THEY LOOK MORE LIKE PIGS THAN THE NORMAL PEOPLE So PIG therefore would be a COMPLIMENT not an INSULT I don know what to make of this line It confuses everything Do PIGS look like HUMANS in this world Who know The scriptwriter should have been more careful with what the character said is all Anyway that what I have to say about this episode It could have been good if they had put a little more thought into it Good message I like the message and the twist and the moral Just need some work,I don like Eye of the Beholder

1079,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,I heard that some people hate this one I not sure their hatred is meaningful however It is one of my all time favorite episode and I think I might be able to shed a little light on why I favor it so much First off it a very creative way of dealing with the whole time travel thing I think it should be put in the top 10 list of all the time travel TV episode The turn of the century wa a time when time travel wa just starting to be accepted a a novel concept so taking a man from 1890 and placing him in 1960 is a neat idea Sure the time machine look nut but that because in 1890 thing were made out of cardboard and tape Mulligan is a fellow who forced to cope with the present and he cope with it in the most hilarious way possible The realism If I saw the first part I couldn tell it wasn a real movie Rod Serling made this at a time before silent movie software wa available and he doe a good job of it The soundtrack is good too changing just at the right moment to give just the right feeling The way in which the format is played around with are creative too when Mulligan blow on the harmonica and fall into the pig pen in particular And let not forget the tremendous effort that were made to make a street look like it came from 1890 they bought chicken and penny farthing to make it look top notch Heck they even bought sign When he go to 1960 the format change and you feel all the wind knocked out of you Then it switch back and you get a rush of nostalgia The gag This episode isn like a normal Twilight Zone episode and that a good thing because it provides a dose of comic relief to contrast with the gritty dark feeling of the other one What I think most critic of this episode don get is that The Twilight Zone isn meant to be a horror show It just a bunch of moral dilemma played out for fun What if scenario Normal people put into weird kooky situation This is an episode where your Average Joe is put into a weird situation and reacts to it he just reacts to it in a more humorous way This is not a scary episode so don look at it a a scary episode Look at it a funny and it seem better I like how Mulligan see the sign and notice that inflation a reality I like how he talk to the TV when he see it If you don like it then you looking for dark theme where there are none Buster for one Buster Keaton is a master of the art and in this episode in his elderly age he display his talent It like watching new Adam Sandler movie 15 year since he made another one I bet the viewer enjoyed it They could have just hired anybody to play the grumpy janitor but they got HIM Do you know what this episode wa like It wa like the new Star Wars It quirky but it golden It the story of a guy who wasn content enough with his own time and then decided that he hated the future even more it funny If you hate it then you never gotten a good kick out of anything before,In defense of Once Upon A Time

1087,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,This episode never get talked about much and I can see why I like both Rod Serling and Ray Bradbury don get me wrong They both genius in their own right But the first time I saw this I wondered what wa going on because I knew that Ray Bradbury had written a story called I Sing the Body Electric Turns out the episode actually based on that story And Ray wrote the screenplay himself This is my problem with it it not supposed to be there Ray Bradbury wa not meant for film or TV HGis word are his greatest power the way his pen breathes life onto the paper One of his story cannot be expressed within the short space of a half hour With this episode the story which I sure wa wonderful to begin with becomes a simple minded bore There a dad and he had three kid and they hire this robot from some robot agency to help them live their life and then the robot lady leaf That literally IT No moral like there usually is no twist nothing It like a bad Mary Poppins ripoff or something In addition the plot is absurd since it set in the present day and they didn HAVE robot making place back then much le now There nothing controversial about it like Rod always doe but there nothing cool about it like Ray always doe The most it come to being intriguing is when there a small amount of conflict in the dull family and one of the daughter get run over by a car but then in some form of deus ex machina she brought back to life I never read the source material I admit but I bet it wa a lot better in short story form than in half hour TV show form It creepy and dull Ray Bradbury and Rod Serling I think weren meant to mix The only other nod to Bradbury I know of is the alien mystery one in the restaurant where the crazy old Grandpa guy Who serf a a form of comic relief but also a a prime suspect when asked about alien responds to the absurdity of the question by saying It like somethin outta Ray BADbury And that IS funny because he mispronounces Bradbury name That a good way of acknowledging Ray I dunno maybe another one of his story could have been adapted one with more complexity to it Maybe I Sing the Body Electric WAS complex and it wa watered down for television format I dunno Maybe The Twilight Zone could have had one of his Martian Chronicles or one of his story from Green Town or something like that I just don like this episode It a bad episode,I Sing the body Electric An Electric Relic from that time when Rod and Brad did something bad
1088,funeralbringer,TwilightZone,Most people have asked me to show this collection http www youtube com watch v 9F2E07Jcuh4,My Twilight Zone Blu Ray Region 2 Overview
1089,Iamnotthethe,TwilightZone,I heard a lot about trying to discern what the best ever Twilight Zone episode That what I consider an impossible feat because they all competent But I a critic and I seen a few which bear scrutinization After running them all over in my head I think I discovered the worst ever Twilight Zone episode ever produced Tell me if you agree The worst episode I referring to of course is episode 7 of season 3 The Grave If you watch it once you might think it wa a masterpiece but you know why I think it a piece of garbage It ripped off an urban legend that been played out through the year a gazillion time I watch The Twilight Zone because each and every plot is original Rod mind wa a whirling powerhouse of inventive twist and allegory and so on Before the Twilight Zone wa made There wa no story about a lady who get a call from her dead son or a suburban neighborhood that turn grotesque after a phony bomb threat And I can accept the corny one like the one where Burgess Meredith get the power of super strength from a two headed alien or the dark gritty one like the one about the man who take three of his enemy down to his basement and try to test their cowardice But I can stand this one episode because Rod put no effort into it He looked in a book of scary ghost story picked this one out and thought Heck I do this That why this one get me The urban legend that this one rip off is a classic that everyone know but it can be set in a variety of setting and it can be claimed a fact even though it happens under impossible circumstance For some unexplained reason Rod decided to set it in the Old West although to be honest he could have just a easily set in on Neptune Not that his Old West one aren good I like when The Twilight Zone take a jaunt out to the desert It wa a neat way to connect with the most popular genre of the time the Western and Rod really wa pretty creative with all of it Showdown with Rance McGrew in particular is a real laugh fest and I like it because it dared to question the historical accuracy of the old showdown show I hate this episode though Rod thought that by switching the setting to the Old West he could make it seem original and by putting in some cheap character and a decent script he could escape cancellation But I can see through it all and every time I watch this episode I like Roddy a little le He could have thought up something mediocre that week just so long a he didn put this sleaze on the air No creativity really We open the episode by hearing that there been a big showdown in the town and Pinto Sykes the vicious outlaw ha been killed This is tricky deceitful way to open It sound intriguing and the viewer think something interesting is going to happen Soon a beefcake enters the local saloon on a spooky night of course we can hear the wind blowing all SPOOKILY outside just to tell u that it all CREEPY Right So this guy come in and they shoot the work for a while chat it up over a few shot of whiskey Really this part is just filler I say that the original urban legend could be told in it entirety in about two minute but of course Rod ha to stretch it out for half an hour so they talk about what a jerk Pinto wa and how his death is controversial and whatnot It saddens me to think that they wasted time writing a script for this If it had an original plot this patter might be necessary After a while we get to the part where the rip off really begin One of the guy say Hey if yore really a tuff cowboy like ya sez ya are then go down to thet thar grave an stick this hyar knife inta his grave Or something like that The tough beefcake cowboy of course accepts the bet and go down to the graveyard On the way he encounter this weird lady who there for no reason she talk more ominously than Morticia in The Addams family and I guess she the relative of Pinto or something like that So the cowboy go down there and he try to stick the knife down and he doe but then when he try to walk away he fall down pulled by some unseen force and then the camera cut back to the saloon The cowboy realize that Mr Hunk Cowboy hasn come back yet so they go down to the grave and check it out He dead Like in the original urban legend one of the cowboy point down to the corpse and say that the guy had stuck the knife into his coat by mistake and when he got up and felt the knife tuck in his coat he thought it wa the dead guy hand pulling on him and he had a heart attack and died Same explanation I heard so many time that I gotten tired of it by now Then in one last desperate attempt to make the episode original the creepy lady point out that the WIND wa blowing last night so that his coat wouldn have been over the grave and the wind is still the same way tonight and so it WAS the dead guy after all OOOOOOH Except for the fact that the wind easily could have shifted at any point during the night and it the weakest point that anybody could have come up with This is Rod trying at the last minute to make it more interesting but it so pathetic that it end up being tiresome and pointless The original urban legend to begin with ha so many plotholes that it doesn make for a good Twilight Zone episode If a person ha the gut to enter a fricking graveyard and stick a knife into a grave then they probably won have a heart attack when they feel a little tugging on their coat Wouldn somebody be able to tell the difference between a knife and a fricking DEAD HAND Anyway this episode is very poorly done and it make me sad to see Rod resorting to something a cheap a this If you don read the urban legend first it seems OK but it loses it value the minute you realize just how hackneyed it is I thought I like to tell you about this episode so you won make the error of watching it like I did for some reason Tell me what you think of it,Worst episode

1220,Ace76inDC,TwilightZone,This really happened The wife had a bad night of sleep and woke me up at about 2am the day before Halloween about two week ago and you know how you remember dream clearly if you wake up suddenly That happened to me Here the weird part my dream wa a complete full length black and white version of the 1960s Twilight Zone Not a dream about an episode that I seen but rather a brand new episode concocted entirely by my subconscious Almost right away the next morning I started telling people about it and my wife in particular encouraged me to write it down I didn wake up in the middle of the episode and decided to finish it I dreamt the whole damn thing start to finish And wa woken up at the exact moment it ended My dream had Nazis in it I going to write about Nazis f you think for a minute I condone Nazis or hate you are dead wrong and I think my value are pretty well reflected by my dream Before you react to this post please read to the very end If you are a Nazi or a racist and you feel a need to reply don I ignore you and your dead ideology They say men don dream dialogue but woman do I can say either way I don recall distinct word or conversation just mostly thought scene and concept I did embellish my dream with the opening and closing narrative Rod Serling style that match my impression in the dream of knowing the setting and implication of the story I also made up a title to match my dream I also heard that men dream in black and white Not too sure about that since I had colorful dream This dream though wa completely black and white just like the old Twilight Zone series I don think a story like this would hold up today But compared to Twilight Zone episode which I since researched I never saw them before my dream like Death Head Revisited and He Alive I think it hold up pretty well I have seen plenty of Star Trek story with Nazis in them This story is similar to Man in a High Castle but not in a contemporary sense everyone in my dream really talked and acted like they did in the original Twilight Zone I also not a writer I an engineer I have no idea how to write a screenplay So I write this a an outline like a Wikipedia episode summary Oh and I apologize this isn a particularly scary Twilight Zone even though I dreamt it up pretty close to Halloween Here it go Living History Opening Scene An outdoor museum similar to Gettysburg in Pennsylvania with wood fencing horse and people in costume and school child bustling about But the camera pull back and reveal tank Nazi flag soldier and statue Visitors child and staff alike wearing Nazi armband Opening Narration Picture an America a lovely field in Pennsylvania but not an America or the Pennsylvania we know today No this America succumbed to the Nazi horde in the Second World War and now life a a subjugated people of the far larger empire of the Third Reich and the bitter memory of this war have long faded In this America lie a museum a living history museum on the site of the last battle of that conflict where her last hope wa extinguished The visitor to this museum come from far and wide to learn about the Master Race victory over the feeble democracy loving Allies What the visitor worker and administrator of this museum will soon come to find out some candle and flame cannot be so easily extinguished in the Twilight Zone Plot Summary The museum is in full swing on a busy day Located somewhere in Pennsylvania the staff put on a show for visitor like a living history museum There are horse ride tank fake uniform and weapon and a few old fashioned wood fence near some WWII trench There is even a pit where Nazi child can come and stomp on an American Flag and several are there stomping away with many more lined up behind them note no it kind of doesn make sense that a horse would be in a WWII museum but there wa definitely a horse in my dream and played a big role The museum staff is quite large with quite a few worker but the Nazi administrator are pretty bored and disinterested except when they are giving order The museum really isn being run all that well Nazis clearly looking forward to the future and not spending much time keeping the place up The horse ride is a disaster the road to the museum is a mess and the place is generally completely run down Our story start with a person I felt wa an Affable American Loser He didn get a name in my dream so I call him AL for short He is the youngest and lowliest member of the staff in charge of horse ride When the supervisor aren around he make all sort of joke with his fellow staff who advise him to keep it down or else he get in trouble A Nazi Supervisor an American but in a Nazi uniform is dressing him down for not following order to give all the child ride before the day is over He complains that the horse is overworked and hasn had enough hay and water The Nazi supervisor isn having it He becomes outraged denies Al request for more hay and water and insists that he fill his ride quota a ordered He explains or shout that he ha been ordered to maintain the museum in an orderly and efficient manner in accordance with the tenet of National Socialism There is a grand inspection tomorrow evening and he insists everything be working at peak efficiency or else With that he stomp off That evening when putting the horse away Al get separated from his other worker and discovers a back door to the prop and supply room normally off limit He pause to admire a Nazi general uniform In the supply room he find a basket of apple and secret them out near the kid horse ride area The next day Al ha his horse ride operation running at peak efficiency thanks to the apple he is secretly feeding his horse The Nazi Supervisor come by and note the better operation He still hold a grudge from yesterday debacle and move on without acknowledging Al work After he leaf a messenger arrives with a message for the Nazi Supervisor The messenger state that the head Nazi General administrator ha been delayed for several day Al being mischievous tell the messenger he a trusted senior member of the museum staff and he convey the message personally to the Supervisor The messenger leaf and Al pull an apple out of his pocket start juggling it in the air and whistle He clearly isn going to deliver the message That evening Al sneak back into the prop room to get more apple On his way out he again admires the general uniform this time he decides to try it on After putting on a fake mustache and monocle his is nearly completely indistinguishable from his former self But a he is putting on his last goose stepping boot he lean up against a wall that turn out to be a door to a conference room Straightening up he see the Museum and local Nazi administrator all lined up at a conference table Seeing him they snap to attention and salute Heil Hitler After a few stunned moment Al realizes he need to fake his way out of this situation He decides to vent his frustration of working at the museum Note Al fake a pretty good German accent I just can write one that well You call this a museum Look at this place The attraction are barely functional the staff lazy this place is a mess and the road coming in is a disaster This place is a disgrace to National Socialism I order that the road repaired immediately animal fed clean up crew established etc etc I order you to make this place run like a well oiled Nazi machine The Supervisor sputter but sir we have not been ordered before to do any of these thing The General reply Well YOU VE BEEN ORDERED NOW THINK OF WAYS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND GET TO WORK After a few moment of stunned silence Al say DISMISSED At that word the Nazis in the conference room scramble out the door to enact the fake General order Al wait just a bit then hurry back to the prop room to change back a fast a he can He emerges to find the Supervisor barking order at the museum staff empowering them to make a many change a possible Al come out of the prop room just in time The Supervisor start to chastise him for not being at his duty station but the horse come by with a happy child on it back The Supervisor leaf without another note Some of Al fellow museum worker give him knowing glance showing that some of them likely know about Al biggest trick ever A key beat is when the Supervisor insists that the museum staff think for themselves making the museum run more efficiently The Supervisor pause for just a moment not quite understanding the implication of what he is ordering people to do Flash forward a few day the museum is running at it highest efficiency ever The road is fixed people are very happy to be there and the trash is picked up A visible transformation ha occurred Al ha become a leader of this effort and the Nazi American Supervisor ha grown to appreciate him At the museum conference room the gathered Administrators which now include Al himself are congratulating themselves and discussing at great length what else could be fixed Having gotten the museum up and running smoothly they are looking at their surrounding town and village and start making suggestion how to fix them like getting train and bus running on time to allow more visitor to the museum Just then the real German Nazi General show up After the usual saluting and Heil Hitler ing the General launch into a tirade JUST WHAT IS GOING ON WHO GAVE THE ORDERS TO USE RESOURCES TO FIX THE MUSEUM and so on The Nazi American Supervisor speaks up hesitantly Sir we were just following order to make this museum run a efficiently a He get cut off WHO AUTHORIZED YOU TO MAKE THESE CHANGES HOW DARE YOU WORK WITHOUT PROPER ORDERS YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING PROPER NATIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES and he really start sputtering accusation The assembled Administrators glare at the General You know in the way they always seemed to do in the old Twlight Zone show That kind of long 60 glare that would be edited down to 0 02 second in a modern TV show with the horn blaring The Nazi American Supervisor grows a backbone maybe for the first time ever No sir you are wrong We are following proper National Socialist value It is you who are out of line Guards please take the General to the Officer quarter and hold him there They do so the General sputtering the whole way The Supervisor turn to his administrative staff After a moment of careful consideration he speaks Gentlemen I believe what we have learned here at this museum can be a great benefit to the people of the Third Reich There are many inefficiency of how our Government run How do we best spread our technique to the larger country After a rapid discussion the gathered Administrators come to an astonishing conclusion They realize they must take charge of the weapon at the museum bring them back into service and seize the local burgermeister office Then they will be able to implement change to the train bus line food supply quality of life etc The Administrators are absolutely convinced they are acting in the best interest of National Socialism and all excitedly rush to action A revolution ha started But a small detail come up a they are rushing to exit the museum Someone call out how will we distinguish ourselves from the Nazis who have lost their way Some discussion ensues Everyone wear the Nazi armband and everyone ha the same uniform and Nazi flag Then Al standing near the back is lightning struck by an idea He rush over to the flag stomping pit and reach down for the American flag As he grasp the staff of the tattered torn and beat up star and stripe the museum worker and supervisor all gather around and look up to it Just starting to comprehend that they haven been acting in the best interest of National Socialism They been acting in the interest of something else something that ha been forgotten for far too long A faint music play a memory of SCENE Closing Narration The gathered people and staff don quite comprehend what a profound transformation ha happened in their humble worn down and nearly forgotten museum Seeking to enact a more perfect form of National Socialism they have learned it basic intrinsic flaw Human initiative and thought are incompatible with a system that demand strict obedience to order above all else From this modest spark a great fire of freedom ha been kindled For the self evident truth of Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are just a self evident and just a true even in the darkest corner of the Twilight Zone,The Night Before Halloween I Dreamt a Complete
