4,nulldrone,1,Picture this if you will a young lad in his 20 who saw brief flash of a zone at a young age Scarred for life he now digging through the past and hit the bedrock known a The Twilight Zone And now I guess he go to a lab and analyzes the mineral composition or whatever that is this review And I called it The Groan Zone What the heck is wrong with me Enjoy amp x200B I love Anthony Freemont I think he a real fascinating character A lot of people write him off a the spoiled godlike dictator that everyone in Peaksville fear but I don think that totally fair In Jerome Bixby original story we get to see more into Anthony mind a watcher of art we have some level of mind reading too Sometimes he go into the grove and play with the animal bringing them nest and water and such At one point he cornfield murder a sleek furry thing ferret for thinking about attacking another li l critter It not out of malice Anthony just doesn realize that animal need to eat and they can just expect him to materialize soy dog or whatever Even when he force a rat to eat itself that only because Aunt Amy doesn like rat in the basement and he trying to do her a favor He probably doesn even realize he broke her brain We see some of this in Serling adaptation a well It clear he framed more a a villain in the Twilight Zone to bump up that spook factor Literally the first thing we learn about Anthony is that he a monster But there still a strange childishness to everything he doe that lends a very particular brand of charm He make a gopher with three head and other funny animal On television night he ha this little plastic dinosaur movie with great effect too if Odyssey of Flight 33 is anything to go off of He doing the whole town a huge favor by making TV in a place without electricity And at some point he wonder why other kid won play with him It oddly isolating having everybody constantly praise you and tell you how great everything is Basically what I getting at is that Anthony is a child He might be an omniscient omnipotent little mutant but he still a child darn it In the original story the fear doesn just come from oh no he cornfield me so much a i don know what he do Even with good intention he doesn understand the full extent of his power and how they affect people He like Bill Soames But Bill dog doesn like him so he just cornfield it And given how everyone always enabling him this is unlikely to change Rod point out one particular thing of note in the intro he can feel every emotion The reason why he so nice to the grove animal in the story is because it make them feel good which make him feel good You could even say he an empath I suspect he doesn feel a lot of genuine joy from people and ha grown to expect this good fakey joy He might realize that something not quite right but they seem happy and everyone reassures him how good he being so he just roll with it That also why when he detects negative emotion he hone in on those and feel them strongly even more so since everyone trying to be happy all the time I really gotta hand it to Bill Mumy he doe a great job of creating this matter of fact god emperor vibe Given how most child actor are he go above and beyond to make Anthony feel smug and callous but in a way you kind of like He also ha that thosuand yard stare that add to the spook factor He really make the episode I glad he eventually got to go into space and build robot or whatever None of the other actor were terribly impressive mostly because they stuck on that hivemind of fear and fake smile The only other character with any semblance of personality are Aunt Amy and Dan Hollis Amy is a living example of how Anthony could mess up anyone even his own family It never clarified what he did to her but a vacant stare is brought up so you get the gist That might be why she seems le terrified of Anthony having the audacity to complain about the heat During Dan speech she reach ever so slightly for a poker implying she wa thinking of stabbing the little brat but chickened out Even though she not quite right she express her resentment toward Anthony a little more bluntly Also the snow at the end is a big screw you to her having commented on the weather earlier Dan the guy who stand up to tyranny and get gunned down immediately He seems petulant in a it my party i cry if i want to kind of way but the booze doesn help On one hand it like c mon bro you can wait till you get home you been living under this god for like six year what an hour or two but don forget they live in a subsistence economy In the story it wa clear that everyone traded thing around and I don think gramophone grow on tree It implied that they all die eventually unless Anthony materializes some food probably candy or something and they can enjoy that In the story Dan is transformed into something like nothing anyone would have believed possible The dan in the box wa all Twilight Zone It the perfect balance of horrific yet childish We don actually see it on screen it just the shadow with a brief cut to his face Just like how they didn show the triplicate gopher this is a smart touch not only because their special effect aren great but they leave more to the imagination When I see that cartoonishly deranged rabbit puppet pop out of the hat in the 1983 movie I can take anything seriously For what it worth it a funny scene filled with cheese just not what I expected This also happens in the 2002 revival when old Anthony burn a hole through someone and set them on fire That episode ha it own share of problem but we leave that for another day amp x200B Overall this wa a real good episode that deserves it spotlight Some worldbuilding and the of the nuance of Anthony character is lost from the original story but other thing are added like Dan telling Anthony off that heighten the conflict and make for a more entertaining watch Moonglow wa a good musical choice leaving behind a nostalgic bitterness behind it cheery service If I been familiar with this I would felt the absence of Doris Day lovely voice Not a super deep one but it compels you with the fear of being subjugated by a fickle omnipotent force to the point that you can even have your own thought And the feeling of closeted entropy that permeates this episode is just wonderful Everything will rot Hurrah amp x200B This is a random note but sometime around the end Mrs Fremont call Mr Fremont dad I can tell if this wa a mistake or if she just doe this because he Anthony dad and the world revolves around Anthony His parent are never given name which is odd Don Keefer wa great too I love how when he say the brandy is real good you can tell he actually being genuine for the first time in a long time So uh give this one a watch And read the original story too It online For free And tell me if you want more of these Leave some comment give your thought on the episode More to come Someday,The Groan Zone It a Good

23,nulldrone,1,I dropping the Serling shtick I can keep it up Basically the idea is that I saw some episode of The Twilight Zone a a child and I want to revisit it It an iconic piece of television and I like that it episodic so I can skip around I wa a dumb kid One for the Angels suck It not even scary so I find something new even in rewatches Also I looked up all the twist on Wikipedia because I wa a dumb kid Hopefully those stay buried I mostly be looking at the original 60 series but never say never It worth mentioning I don have Season 4 so we save our Jess Belles and Printer Devils for later Browsing through the catalog one of the episode that made a huge impression on me wa Perchance to Dream I remember it being terrifying and it had a cat in it which is always good But this cat out of the bag and diving foot first into the Twilight Zone amp x200B It still spooky Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statue and all that Even when people say they silly and cheesy I can help getting spooked But most of the spook come from Robert Florey directing I have to get back to some of his other episode According to Charles Beaumont Florey strove for quality and this episode might have been the most expensive MGM feature It show Right at the beginning we trail along a low angle shot of a building making it look powerful and imposing After that we cut between Edward Hall weary face and people cycling in and out of the building emphasizing how nerve wracking such a trivial task is for him It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity like an opener should With how quick these cut are I start to feel dizzy there a distinct sense of vertigo here In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written story are capable of conveying more information than television That obviously not true and this episode serf a a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition movement and sound Granted I haven read Beaumont original story but I can stress enough how great Florey directing is here This episode play with fear and paranoia and take it sweet time to build up to Hall serialized nightmare The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it shot really make me anxious Just like the beginning we flash between Hall panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object you gotta go back and wonder what Hall wa seeing in the building and people going through it Seeing the infamous eye for the first time isn even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drive my heart rate up and the aftermath feel like an afterthought Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can help it and it consequence are all too real whether a a car crash or death itself This idea continues a we enter Hall dream In a way a dream is just a form of Hall imagination only stronger and harder to escape When he talk to Maya for the first time she point out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it only a dream not realizing how much a dream can affect him It not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thought without realizing how they being consumed or how others can wave off one paranoid thought a something you can just think away Maya us this to her advantage it only a dream so why not indulge a little Not only into Hall fear but also into the thrill of a funhouse a rollercoaster or even a courtesan Maya represents Hall indulgence whether it into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear view mirror An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence The idea isn that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought The power of the mind is terrifying A low key fear of mine is Maya freakin laughter It there at the beginning of Hall dream it there a Hall get spooked by Maya and it there a Hall enters and exit the funhouse Juxtaposing laughter with dark unsettling imagery evokes not only that someone know something you don but also that they delight in your disorientation amp x200B Now it time to talk about my least favorite part of the episode the twist This episode didn happen Hall died 3 minute into the episode just after he entered Dr Rathmann office It a real Playtest There always something that bother me about these kind of twist it cheapens the episode a bit basically admitting to the audience that this wa all a fat load of nothing This episode fare better than most because thematically it deeply ingrained in dream a a stronger vehicle of the imagination Although Hall official cause of death is probably a heart attack we see that in his mind he commits suicide he can handle the idea that Maya ha followed him to this safe space and fear that she going to kill him so he end up doing it for her So what my beef with the twist So the idea is that Hall imagination end up consuming him Hall see someone who look like Maya and it scare him so much that he jump out the window But when this is revealed to be a dream something is lost It not like in Twenty Two where Liz experience the terror of seeing her dream play out in real life it would work if that were the case because Hall paranoid dream create dissonance with reality the painting isn really moving There nobody in the backseat Hall imagination is superseding reality With the twist Hall imagination is only superseding his imagination He imagined this scenario where the receptionist look like Maya and it too much for him Of course the ending reveals that the IRL receptionist Miss Thomas bear a striking resemblance to Maya but that practically irrelevant His dream is only referencing itself There no reality to ground it Who to say that both Maya appearance in the dream within a dream and the psychiatrist dream aren both based off of Miss Thomas If Shadow Play is anything to go off of Maya appearance might change with every dream Her piercing eye are her main feature And you could argue that the shock of seeing Maya is what drove his heart over the edge in real life but they barely feel connected The powerful fear of becoming disconnected with reality is lost completely because dreaming is a normal commonplace thing you not disconnecting from reality I actually like the set up Hall dream are affecting him IRL from the start not in some tenuous physiological connection but because they forcing him to stay awake Some have said that this is a more realistic episode but this is the part that swerve into fantasy the idea that the dream affected him so much it killed him You die in a dream you die in real life So why even have the twist Some say that Beaumont is overly indulgent in twist and I can kinda see that it a little cheesy in Person or Persons Unknown and A Nice Place to Visit but we have other example like Shadow Play and Long Live Walter Jameson that don really have twist though the twist to the latter is pretty weak The main two aspect of this twist are the idea of imagination consuming Hall life and the dissonance between reality and imagination What better way to show how powerful Hall imagination ha become by putting him fully into it through a dream and having that kill him Maybe I would liked it more if he just had vivid hallucination and ran around completely disorientated But the second part is the crux of the twist in his dream Hall dy violently and of his own accord he jump out of a window signifying his heart giving out But he dy peacefully in real life without nobody realizing the trauma he gone through On the one hand I like that the Twilight Zone is acknowledging that people see think and feel thing differently and want u to empathize more with others but this theme isn developed well enough I don hate the twist but I think it kind of lame and I wouldn go to it birthday party I don always like the subtle touch but the way it used here is decent just not in a way I can really get behind And I totally biased against this genre of twist so if you made it this far take this salt with a grain of twist Writing this out make me appreciate the twist more amp x200B Also John Larch who played Mr Fremont in It a Good Life come back front a Elliott Rathmann the psychiatrist Total coincidence I like him a lot better here a this wry understated psychiatrist that crack joke about not looking like Freud It interesting that he offer Hall a smoke a even then the health effect are known of course this is all Hall dream so we don actually know anything about the real Rathmann This wa probably an excuse to get him towards the window In fact what little we see of Rathmann show him a a more concerned active figure maybe Hall think of him a this droll character to help calm him down When Hall is explaining his strong imagination with every one of Rathmann reassurance Hall immediately responds with I know At no point doe Rathmann challenge Hall or give him any new information Hall is talking to himself And the smoke end up paralleling Maya giving him a light in his dream signifying the false sense of calm preluding the very real danger he in Clever Hall end up being half right in his paranoia falling asleep doe end up killing him but not in the way he expected He doesn end up dreaming in serial back to the carnival but rather someplace a safe and prosaic a a psychiatrist office It one thing to find something spooky in a spooky carnival but in an ordinary office Shock city Overall this is the kind of episode where you have to be right there with the protagonist to really enjoy it If you aren relating to Hall you could easily see this episode a slowly paced and kind of boring He loses me a little near the end but this is easily one of the better psychological thriller episode of the Twilight Zone And I know nobody will share my gripe with the twist so all the more reason to check it out This is a dream you won want to wake up from Also I forgot to talk about Richard Conte and Suzanne Lloyd performance They were good I liked their chemistry,The Groan Zone Perchance to Dream Review,I dropping the Serling shtick I can keep it up Basically the idea is that I saw some episode of The Twilight Zone a a child and I want to revisit it It an iconic piece of television and I like that it episodic so I can skip around I wa a dumb kid One for the Angels suck It not even scary so I find something new even in rewatches Also I looked up all the twist on Wikipedia because I wa a dumb kid Hopefully those stay buried I mostly be looking at the original 60 series but never say never It worth mentioning I don have Season 4 so we save our Jess Belles and Printer Devils for later Browsing through the catalog one of the episode that made a huge impression on me wa Perchance to Dream I remember it being terrifying and it had a cat in it which is always good But this cat out of the bag and diving foot first into the Twilight Zone amp x200B It still spooky Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statue and all that Even when people say they silly and cheesy I can help getting spooked But most of the spook come from Robert Florey directing I have to get back to some of his other episode According to Charles Beaumont Florey strove for quality and this episode might have been the most expensive MGM feature It show Right at the beginning we trail along a low angle shot of a building making it look powerful and imposing After that we cut between Edward Hall weary face and people cycling in and out of the building emphasizing how nerve wracking such a trivial task is for him It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity like an opener should With how quick these cut are I start to feel dizzy there a distinct sense of vertigo here In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written story are capable of conveying more information than television That obviously not true and this episode serf a a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition movement and sound Granted I haven read Beaumont original story but I can stress enough how great Florey directing is here This episode play with fear and paranoia and take it sweet time to build up to Hall serialized nightmare The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it shot really make me anxious Just like the beginning we flash between Hall panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object you gotta go back and wonder what Hall wa seeing in the building and people going through it Seeing the infamous eye for the first time isn even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drive my heart rate up and the aftermath feel like an afterthought Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can help it and it consequence are all too real whether a a car crash or death itself This idea continues a we enter Hall dream In a way a dream is just a form of Hall imagination only stronger and harder to escape When he talk to Maya for the first time she point out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it only a dream not realizing how much a dream can affect him It not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thought without realizing how they being consumed or how others can wave off one paranoid thought a something you can just think away Maya us this to her advantage it only a dream so why not indulge a little Not only into Hall fear but also into the thrill of a funhouse a rollercoaster or even a courtesan Maya represents Hall indulgence whether it into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear view mirror An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence The idea isn that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought The power of the mind is terrifying A low key fear of mine is Maya freakin laughter It there at the beginning of Hall dream it there a Hall get spooked by Maya and it there a Hall enters and exit the funhouse Juxtaposing laughter with dark unsettling imagery evokes not only that someone know something you don but also that they delight in your disorientation amp x200B Now it time to talk about my least favorite part of the episode the twist This episode didn happen Hall died 3 minute into the episode just after he entered Dr Rathmann office It a real Playtest There always something that bother me about these kind of twist it cheapens the episode a bit basically admitting to the audience that this wa all a fat load of nothing This episode fare better than most because thematically it deeply ingrained in dream a a stronger vehicle of the imagination Although Hall official cause of death is probably a heart attack we see that in his mind he commits suicide he can handle the idea that Maya ha followed him to this safe space and fear that she going to kill him so he end up doing it for her So what my beef with the twist So the idea is that Hall imagination end up consuming him Hall see someone who look like Maya and it scare him so much that he jump out the window But when this is revealed to be a dream something is lost It not like in Twenty Two where Liz experience the terror of seeing her dream play out in real life it would work if that were the case because Hall paranoid dream create dissonance with reality the painting isn really moving There nobody in the backseat Hall imagination is superseding reality With the twist Hall imagination is only superseding his imagination He imagined this scenario where the receptionist look like Maya and it too much for him Of course the ending reveals that the IRL receptionist Miss Thomas bear a striking resemblance to Maya but that practically irrelevant His dream is only referencing itself There no reality to ground it Who to say that both Maya appearance in the dream within a dream and the psychiatrist dream aren both based off of Miss Thomas If Shadow Play is anything to go off of Maya appearance might change with every dream Her piercing eye are her main feature And you could argue that the shock of seeing Maya is what drove his heart over the edge in real life but they barely feel connected The powerful fear of becoming disconnected with reality is lost completely because dreaming is a normal commonplace thing you not disconnecting from reality I actually like the set up Hall dream are affecting him IRL from the start not in some tenuous physiological connection but because they forcing him to stay awake Some have said that this is a more realistic episode but this is the part that swerve into fantasy the idea that the dream affected him so much it killed him You die in a dream you die in real life So why even have the twist Some say that Beaumont is overly indulgent in twist and I can kinda see that it a little cheesy in Person or Persons Unknown and A Nice Place to Visit but we have other example like Shadow Play and Long Live Walter Jameson that don really have twist though the twist to the latter is pretty weak The main two aspect of this twist are the idea of imagination consuming Hall life and the dissonance between reality and imagination What better way to show how powerful Hall imagination ha become by putting him fully into it through a dream and having that kill him Maybe I would liked it more if he just had vivid hallucination and ran around completely disorientated But the second part is the crux of the twist in his dream Hall dy violently and of his own accord he jump out of a window signifying his heart giving out But he dy peacefully in real life without nobody realizing the trauma he gone through On the one hand I like that the Twilight Zone is acknowledging that people see think and feel thing differently and want u to empathize more with others but this theme isn developed well enough I don hate the twist but I think it kind of lame and I wouldn go to it birthday party I don always like the subtle touch but the way it used here is decent just not in a way I can really get behind And I totally biased against this genre of twist so if you made it this far take this salt with a grain of twist Writing this out make me appreciate the twist more amp x200B Also John Larch who played Mr Fremont in It a Good Life come back front a Elliott Rathmann the psychiatrist Total coincidence I like him a lot better here a this wry understated psychiatrist that crack joke about not looking like Freud It interesting that he offer Hall a smoke a even then the health effect are known of course this is all Hall dream so we don actually know anything about the real Rathmann This wa probably an excuse to get him towards the window In fact what little we see of Rathmann show him a a more concerned active figure maybe Hall think of him a this droll character to help calm him down When Hall is explaining his strong imagination with every one of Rathmann reassurance Hall immediately responds with I know At no point doe Rathmann challenge Hall or give him any new information Hall is talking to himself And the smoke end up paralleling Maya giving him a light in his dream signifying the false sense of calm preluding the very real danger he in Clever Hall end up being half right in his paranoia falling asleep doe end up killing him but not in the way he expected He doesn end up dreaming in serial back to the carnival but rather someplace a safe and prosaic a a psychiatrist office It one thing to find something spooky in a spooky carnival but in an ordinary office Shock city Overall this is the kind of episode where you have to be right there with the protagonist to really enjoy it If you aren relating to Hall you could easily see this episode a slowly paced and kind of boring He loses me a little near the end but this is easily one of the better psychological thriller episode of the Twilight Zone And I know nobody will share my gripe with the twist so all the more reason to check it out This is a dream you won want to wake up from Also I forgot to talk about

proper noun have swapped meaning And that the low key horror I beginning to expect from 80 Farmer Jack As funny a it is to hear people speak gibberish like it a normal thing it would be mind crushingly horrible to not only not understand anything no speech no writing nothing And everything that come out of your mouth make you sound like a babbling veil There are actual disorder like this people with receptive aphasia have damage in the Wernicke area the part of the brain responsible for processing language This can be caused by stroke injury brain tumor dementia it incredibly sad to

scene where Kathy and Hinge hug is really heartwarming You can tell he really needed that It also compelling how through his action Kathy can still see that he care deeply about their son despite being incoherent I like the dinner scene too You really wanna root for Hinge and see him get through this The ending end on a slightly depressing note acknowledging the reality that Hinge is gonna have to learn this language all over again except he ha to forget everything he already know I don know if this is easier or harder than learning a completely new language I go with harder since the word seem to be swapped at random without any reed of grammar For all we know throw is now fax and threw is now diphthong Still you wanna root for him And holy lederhosen do I hate the closing

on memorizing a bunch of medical jargon at the beginning It not a great impetus but it better than just going lol some thing just happen for no reason in the farmer jack character is what really matter This episode is a clever mix of comedy and drama Seeing people randomly swap out word and eventually devolving into gibbering beast is funny to u but with context it horrifying I argue 60 Farmer Jack doesn have it balanced a well though it might just come from the strong concept alone It also funny watching people try to spout nonsense with a straight face Cindy snicker a little while giving Hinge the timid waffle guarantee The neighbor stumble over encyclopedia a little bit I not 100 convinced these people think they saying something meaningful but the absurdity of what they saying make up for it I think the hospital scene wa one of the better spoken gibberish and you think that would cut the tension of the situation but not knowing how Donnie gonna do actually make it more tense I have a few small nitpicks like the overly dramatic wind that start blowing when Kathy say dinosaur Twice But for an episode that hinge on it concept it executes it serviceably and I probably put this a a decent plus episode when stacked up to the 60 series amp x200B Also I appreciate the minor insight that a lot of background sound get filtered out I didn catch the radio thing on

of these word I not sure how much thought the writer put into them but I do hear certain word pop up multiple time so I sure there a cipher rotting in a dumpster somewhere So the next time you see a

73,Ghidoran,1,So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theory about it one is a mindbending Shyamalan esque twist the other is more metaphorical Theory 1 Sameer is a comedian past his prime with no friend or family due to his focus on his career and the whole episode is a delusion created by him to have a positive explanation for his current life Expanded Sameer wa actually a very successful comedian and the life he ha near the end of the episode no girlfriend or friend is his real life His heyday is behind him however and a his career start to slow down he realizes how empty his life ha become He wa too consumed with fame and ended up making no real friend or having a family Unable to cope with both a faltering career and no relationship to fall back on he begin to concoct this crazy delusional fantasy that he wa a struggling stand up comedian who had a loving girlfriend and friend but then he discovered the secret to making people laugh i e the plot of the episode Basically he pretend he got rid of old good life in order to become famous Ultimately he realizes his selfishness and give it all up by destroying himself thereby becoming an unknown This false reality help him cope with the sad situation of his current life At the end of the episode he doesn even exist to these people he just another memory of the comedy club immortalized in the photo This isn some supernatural trickery from Tracy Morgan it just the reality of a comedian who hit it big and then faded into obscurity Theory 2 The whole episode is an allegory for suicide and Sameer is actually a heavily distressed man who end up destroying his relationship with people around him and eventually kill himself Expanded Sameer is a very depressed He try to tell joke to make himself feel better hence why he see himself a a comedian tear of a clown and all that but in reality he continuously miserable represented by his inability to be successful He slowly destroys his closest relationship represented by the people he joke about disappearing in the episode which is something that happens in real life for some people with depression He doe this partly to make himself feel better represented by his newfound fame but ultimately he realizes he the cause of the pain At the end in a desperate bid to make everything right i e to get rid of the source of the pain he kill himself represented by him joking about himself and thus disappearing The end of the episode is a fantasy he envisioned with the people he loved going on with their daily life happy and him just being a forgotten memory represented by him being one of the photo on the wall These are just my theory anyway Obviously the surface level interpretation of the episode is don sacrifice friend and family for personal gain but I like to think there more to the episode Let me know your thought,Two theory about The Comedian,So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theory

99,JuliusHibbert,1,I know there are a bunch of way to interpret this episode but a comment and a question by u SentimentalSentinels inspired me to type and share my take on it One of my favorite part of watching the Twilight Zone is dissecting the meaning and seeing what we can take from it Much like the original this episode wa a study in paranoia personal mentality and distress In my view Bob the pilot exemplified how authority figure often exploit those fear to serve their own purpose Unlike the original the monster in this episode wa fear paranoia and the danger of how that manifest i e seeing connection that don exist distrust of others prejudicial thinking conspiratorial thinking blaming others etc Furthermore I think the argument could be made that the monster is Sanderson himself but unlike the first iteration of the show the writer hint that the monster within u is more dangerous than the unknown monster outside on the wing u SentimentalSentinels also made a great point about how they use the podcast to exemplify how sensationalism in the medium play a role in feeding these emotion I e the podcast Sanderson article etc To go one level deeper in my view Bob the pilot personified how a person of semi authority can parrot our concern to play into our greatest fear Once we feel that that person truly understands u or that they are the only one who can help they use their power to exploit our clouded judgement to cause chaos great harm The saddest part wa that Sanderson wa so blinded by desperation and fear that he didn realize he wa helping to cause the chaos he wa desperately trying to prevent The pilot played on Sanderson paranoia and fear to seize control and takeover the plane and achieve the end he sought Depots and demagogue use this tactic the time They demonize an other a a source of a problem play into the fear of a large population of people and use it to seize power and control for their own power control Much like the episode the depot oftentimes do this at the expense of the people they claimed they were helping I think this episode can be interpreted a a microcosm of that behavior Know this may be a reach and your mileage may vary but I really enjoyed it and just wanted to include my two cent Please post your theory or commentary would love to hear all the differing opinion and hopefully have my mind opened to thing I hadn considered,The deeper meaning amp subtext in Nightmare at 30 000 foot,I know there are a bunch of way to interpret this episode but a comment and a question by u SentimentalSentinels inspired me to type and share my take on it One of my favorite part of watching the Twilight Zone is dissecting the meaning and seeing what we can take from it Much like the original this episode wa a study in paranoia personal mentality and distress In my view Bob the pilot exemplified how authority figure often exploit those fear to serve their own purpose Unlike the original the monster in this episode wa fear paranoia and the danger of how that manifest i e seeing connection that don exist distrust of others prejudicial thinking conspiratorial thinking blaming others etc Furthermore I think the argument could be made that the monster is Sanderson himself but unlike the first iteration of the show the writer hint that the monster within u is more dangerous than the unknown monster outside on the wing u SentimentalSentinels also made a great point about how they use the podcast to exemplify how sensationalism in the medium play a role in feeding these emotion I e the podcast Sanderson article etc To go one level deeper in my view Bob the pilot personified how a person of semi authority can parrot our concern to play into our greatest fear Once we feel that that person truly understands u or that they are the only one who can help they use their power to exploit our clouded judgement to cause chaos great harm The saddest part wa that Sanderson wa so blinded by desperation and fear that he didn realize he wa helping to cause the chaos he wa desperately trying to prevent The pilot played on Sanderson paranoia and fear to seize control and takeover the plane and achieve the end he sought Depots and demagogue use this tactic the time They demonize an other a a source of a problem play into the fear of a large population of people and use it to seize power and control for their own power control Much like the episode the depot oftentimes do this at the expense of the people they claimed they were helping I think this episode can be interpreted a a microcosm of that behavior Know this may be a reach and your mileage may vary but I really enjoyed it and just wanted to include my two cent Please post your theory or commentary would love to hear all the differing opinion and hopefully have my mind opened to thing I hadn consideredThe deeper meaning amp subtext in Nightmare at 30 000 foot

101,nulldrone,1,Hey you totally killed tonight Guy Oh thank you you know I actually un killed two people Samir amp x200B And just like that we hopping on the hype train Ironically this episode isn all that funny and the quote above wa one of the few joke I laughed at It a shame they got Tracy Morgan just to have him on for 5 minute a this spooky brooding devil type Yeah this episode more intent on being dramatic with the classic deal for fame shtick And generally I think it doe a good job Kumail Nanjiana isn the funniest dude but I like his kinda pathetic drama thing goin on And what little we see from other comedian isn that great either but whatever When we see Samir get angry on stage and do an impromptu erasing we feel his frustration This is some genuine shit talking I liked his monologue at the end when he admits that he doesn know why he want fame it go back to this empty vulnerability that sends him off with a shred of sympathy Ladies and gentleman give it up for the Twilight Zone amp x200B Even though the premise of this episode is pretty basic I still intrigued by the idea it going with Because often a a comedian you do share your life with others and thing become le personal especially when you a somebody Like if you really famous and you bitter over an ex you can call them out and it awkward for both of you I guess this isn really a problem in the episode but I like that it grounded And I agree with our pretentious friend David comedy is art When you write a book you can cover thing up use a metaphor or just have different character act out event based on your life experience Peele seems to agree after all he call Samir an artist I feel to some extent this is a minor commentary on Peele own career The line between comedy and horror is thinner than you think And yes this is an hour long episode I haven seen Season 4 of the 60 Zone so I guess I take your word for it that it wa mixed I don think this is necessarily a bad fit for the episode but I am annoyed that it take Samir an extra 10 minute to figure out what going on There a part to all these Twilight Zone episode when something supernatural happens and the main character try to rationalize it or think people are pranking him We call this gag time Then about halfway into the episode thing really kick off with Samir erasing all the jerk from high school we get plenty of reference to character from 60 TZ and the pacing get dialed up to 11 going for some real pacing whiplash I think this whole episode take place in about a month A week I also think that they killed off DiDi too quick and Rena should interrupted him on that day maybe he already listing a bunch of people to try to impress Candy Sure he hesitates a little but it just not enough for the day that can make or break his career Sure seeing him get angry and numb to his murder spree is alright but I think that would been more effective I don think 22 minute is enough for the episode but it could been trimmed down a bit Nothing feel horribly padded I have to admit the part where Rena break up with Samir is weak They trying to be clever by having Rena call him out about how selfish he is for yuckin around while she ha to make end meet a a waitress when in reality we know the real reason he selfish is because he erasing hundred of people for fame It just hard for me to buy the fake reason They try to wave this by saying their relationship isn a good without David existence but what setting this off If she going to stay together with him for 5 year then being late for one day isn going to be the straw that break the camel back Not to mention that his career finally is taking off which mean it only a matter of time until he can start supporting them anyways I wa hoping that this whole erasing people ha consequence thing would be showcased differently like maybe by erasing hundred of bad people the police are more lax or something And Samir is right when he said she wa okay with him erasing people for fame which is honestly a weird thing for her to encourage Maybe she doesn believe he actually erasing people but she seemed pretty on board This also lessens the emotional impact when she criticizes his act later You already knew this It not clear what happens to people after he tell the joke since his joke are just him ribbing on people who don exist anymore Despite his fame nobody ever going to quote or tell one of his joke That another thing with the whole you have to give something up during stand up idea because you don actually give it up Sure it not longer personal and it can mess with your relationship but good joke last a people retell them So everyone just think he funny and nobody know why Weird One of the most surprising complaint I come across is the swearing TV MA is the first thing that pop onto the screen You know what you were getting into I welcome that Peele Twilight Zone ha the privilege of saying more and doing more It wa pretty subdued in Nightmare From 30 000 Feet I actually thought the Oh shit He the pilot wa really funny And when Sanderson say he saw fucked up shit near the beginning that wa a pivotal character defining moment Pretty good swears They used differently in The Comedian Now to those of you complaining about the swears have you never been to a comedy club before I do hope you never check one out because you probably have a heart attack The biggest perpetrator of casual swears who I like to call The Swear Bugbear is DiDi Scott I love DiDi She my favorite Her swears aren forced they integral to her act and her character and make her a great foil for Samir When Samir tell her to take all her advice in an e mail and send it to the bottom of the ocean she retaliates with Yeah hey could you suck my vagina It great Not only doe it contrast these character but it show how they like to banter and it some good early light heartedness When Rena break up with Samir you really believe that DiDi is his only friend left and that give the scene where he era her some weight to it Also when Samir tell DiDi not to say any of the bad word in front of his girlfriend nephew I swear that a jab at you guy And the other guy who joked about censoring c ss Some good premonition here Obviously swearing isn always good and it can get overly vulgar and excessive but I don think we there yet Not even close amp x200B So doe it measure up to the 60 Twilight Zone There a knee jerk no because it hard to make a continuation of something while capturing the heft of being original and groundbreaking And a somebody who watching many 60 Twilight Zones for the first time I might be complaining that some of the older episode are pretty cliche with obvious twist I know that not fair because a lot of them weren cliche at the time but that doesn change my viewing experience But that doesn necessarily make an episode bad either If I can enjoy the ride the destination isn a important And I enjoyed this ride I also don really care about whatever arbitrary standard come with the title The Twilight Zone Good stuff is good y know I liked some of the exaggerated lighting choice that made Eddies look dark and grimy I like Samir and Rena relationship and it wa cute to see them be happy for a short bit even if you know they just included that to fuel the break up later Freaky deaky murderer need love too And I know people were pent up about this series being overly political but this episode wasn political at all sans some bad political joke from our boy Samir Actually it weird that he always open with the 2nd amendment joke is that like the only joke he been telling For 5 year No wonder he so desperate He also made a joke about our president and speaking of which given that he so interested in politics I surprised he not using them for some kind of political gain I doubt he be careful enough to think about the repercussion Now that be an interesting episode in it own right almost like a more upfront The Whole Truth So those are my hot take on the new modern 20 Jordan Peel 3rd Reboot Twilight Zone extravaganza I liked it You can make me un like it Will I review all the new thing Sure but maybe not right away I don really feel like reviewing the Adam Scott airplane podcast gremlin doll spectacular right now so we still keeping our foot firmly rooted in the 60 Even though those have only consisted of 50 of these review so far Hmm This is also where I plug my Wordplay review because I wa hoping more people would read that like one But yeah I feel pretty optimistic about this series and I think it gonna be a blast Also I can tell if the airplane joke wa a reference to the next episode or not but I feel like it totally is And they had the dummy from The Dummy And there were also name reference in Samir contact Aren reference fun,The Groan Zone The Comedian Review,Hey you totally killed tonight Guy Oh thank you you know I actually un killed two people Samir amp x200B And just like

127,luigirools,1,TL DR I didn care for it at all Just about everything decision in the production felt off to me and I very disappointed Let me start by saying I wa really hoping to enjoy this a lot I a huge fan of the original series and caught a few here and there very late in the evening when I slept over my Grandma house Last year I decided to finally take the plunge and watch each episode and while not everyone wa a winner I estimate 5 10 perhaps aren very good but by and large the series is an absolute classic and a must watch for fan who are interested in science fiction Especially if you like looking at the story from their place in history and the influence they had in pop culture I remember growing up hearing about The Twilight Zone in song lyric and cartoon metaphor in day to day language the show wa and still is pretty inescapable in some capacity With all that being said it an understatement to say that I wa excited for a Brand New stylish series for my generation that paid homage and nodded liberally to the original series Now I really think that I may have been too excited a I often am for new thing This often lead me to big disappointment but I keep holding on and hoping for something great Jordan Peele reboot of the series start off with a very rocky episode that really make me hesitant to even continue Just about everything that I don like about newer medium is present here Bland and boring visuals underwhelming writing unlikable character and a overly drawn out runtime 1 Bland and Boring Visuals Overall I just think that the visual style is rather boring The color palatte is drab and muted just like most everything else today The camera work is creative in a few place but for the most part wa shot like it wa any other show I wa expecting or rather hoping the show to have more flair or at least to have it own unique visual style It not amateur or anything but it didn stand out or excite me in any way I really wish a show like this would take the opportunity to really go crazy with vibrant color and nonstandard camera angle They could use element like those to visually tell the story without the need for verbose dialogue 2 Underwhelming Writing Unlikable Characters The writing in this episode wa all over the place The dialogue never felt natural like all the character are reciting from a script a bad script It really felt forced most of the time I kept thinking to myself this is not how people talk Usually this would not bug me a much but they are obviously going for a real world tone and that clash with the dialogue that try too hard to sound hip with new expression instead of just sounding like normal people It really creates this odd disconnect with the world it creates and it just ended up feeling really forced That brings me to my next problem the cursing Now I not a prude at all I love raunchy stuff when it fit but the constant swearing doe not fit at all If I wanted to hear people swear THAT much I would have watched a Rob Zombie film That not a knock at Zombie at all I love his work and all of his movie are very entertaining in those story the raunchy dialogue work a lot better than it doe here But I will say that the character in Rob Zombie film are every bit a unlikable a the character in this episode I not sure if that wa the intention to have no relatable character but none of the character had any redeeming quality Every last one wa mean spirited and it lessened the impact of the story and it also deadened the asserted moral I not even sure at this point that there wa a moral to this story but it sort of seems like there wa one It just confusing and the narrative wa all over the place It just really reminds you of how the original series didn need to swear to get the story across The story we played straight and handled with a lot of class and all of that wa missing here I really think that is the single biggest factor that detracts from the episode there wasn any class at all Just clunky and overly raunchy dialogue not to mention the very unlikable character It all just feel so mean spirited and unnecassary 3 Overly Drawn Out Runtime This one is the problem I have the least to say about but it only exacerbates the previous problem I mentioned The runtime is just too darn long Most of the runtime is rather boring to look at and not fun to listen to The story isn a complex one at all and could have been told in a much shorter time I don know why film and television are trending toward stretching out the runtime but I really don like it Most of the time the film or show isn made any better with the inclusion of double the runtime and oftentimes it just get very tedious and boring to slog through something for that long Every Marvel movie that coming out is at least 2 or 2 and a half hour long and the newest upcoming film in the series Avengers Endgame is a staggering 3 hour long Why I get really bored sitting through anything for that length of time Typically it isn filled with anymore meat just more fluff for whatever reason and that is definitely the case for this episode a well I really wish these sort of show and movie would cut off the fat and just get to the point Final Thoughts Yeah this episode wasn my cup of tea and I am very disappointed about that I wa really hoping for a respectful insightful and visually engaging Twilight Zone reboot but what I ended up seeing wa completely a different product I will admit I am very disinterested to even continue on with the series At this point I much rather just continue to watch the remaining few episode of the original series and the first two revival that I haven seen yet Yet I not wanting to completely throw out the towel yet Many people say the first episode is a heck of a stinker but go on to praise the second much more highly I still not completely sold from the preview I seen it just doesn look any better The ONLY thing I think they nailed wa the music It PERFECT The opening and closing rendition of the original and the cue inspired by the original are really fun and I like to listen to the music on it own on Spotify or something Jordan Peele himself is passable a a host he isn captivating or anything but he is a highlight for the episode that for sure Overall this episode wa about a deep a a puddle and about a interesting to look at a one too but I will admit that that would be an insult to puddle There are some good bit but it mostly surrounded by bitter and unsavory chunk that left a bad taste in my mouth Please feel free to leave a comment

167,nulldrone,1,Wish for them I can bring you Scotland Yard the Federal Bureau of Investigation or every Bobby in the city of London Is it the police you want Genie amp x200B Watching medium outside of it historical context is often tricky Is it fair to judge a piece of art for being cliche if it pioneered that cliche How much bearing should that have on my opinion I can sit here and pretend like it all well and good and not something I seen a million time before but that disingenuous Now when I put on my reviewer hat I ought to be understanding of context but that easier said than done Genies Jinn have been around for millennium They intelligent have crazy power and look real weird They can be your angle or yuor devil They basically a unique and varied a human but like superhumans And a we all know human need to be kept on a leash hence the whole bottle thing I think Solomon had like hundred of bottle in his genie cellar We can credit a lot of how we the west see genie to Arabian Nights Now this episode seems to mostly be concerned with juxtaposing the genie with a fairly typical relatable couple writhing in debt I hold that this wasn an original idea even for it time but it certainly paved the way for many bottle to come From primordial superhumans to Will Smith this is another tale of another genie and the people he messing with And yes it in the Twilight Zone amp x200B Arthur Castle ha to be like the dumbest guy ever Top 10 Dumbest Twilight Zone Protags coming soon to a sub near you Head of a foreign country can be voted out of office within this century Dude aren you Jewish I don think it confirmed whether the character is Jewish but Luther Adler is and he doe have a nice kvetch to his voice Even if I hadn seen that Futurama parody this is beyond predictable I do think that if his character is Jewish it add more horror to the twist but it also make him like really really dumb I get he all caught up on the wish train but he literally trying to make a wish that doesn have consequence when the most obvious of all consequence is right under his nose in a toothbrush mustache And apparently Adler played Hitler twice before this so it might even be an in joke It a strong twist in theory but it sheer obviousness ha it fall flat He totally deserves Genie evil laughter Also it clever that the genie lamp subbed in for the cyanide bottle even though it historically inaccurate That the least of this episode problem I like that Arthur and Edna Castle are genuinely good people Usually the way these story play out is that the wishmaker or wishee is greedy and deserves to be punished for their selfish desire They get carried away but the beginning establishes that they good people who are just trying to get by I don blame them for wishing for a million dollar which would go for 8 million today or the power thing Edna doe feel a little superfluous in all this Arthur doe all the wishing She basically just there to doubt Arthur I guess technically Arthur owns the bottle but still I always appreciated the Twilight Zone minimalism including casting but to have a character that basically doe nothing in an episode with 3 major character is disappointing But enough negativity Arthur generosity to Mrs Gumley is heartwarming and it a little weird that he get punished for this Wait no he doesn Mental scar notwithstanding In fact he gain something he get 5 buck out of the deal and all of his poor friend get bundle of money I know he reset everything but the glass wasn reset until he bumped into it You could suppose that all the money they donated will get magicked away somehow but they end up appreciating what little they have and it still a happy ending at least I also like the antique shop given how minimal the setting usually are especially in the next episode it nice to see a bunch of ornate statue and ceramic and such I think I saw the Holy Grail somewhere It also cement the irony of being surrounded by this extravagant stuff while being on the verge of bankruptcy Also apparently some of the music here is used from What You Need Nice touch I love Joseph Ruskin in this He honestly make the episode I like that the smoke coming out of the bottle at first is implied to be from Genie because he sure drag that cig throughout the entire episode He come off a a subdued salesman like someone who act formal with a vague hint of the sinister You can see a glimmer of amusement a he watch the Castles debate over what to wish for Look at how he beam when Arthur brings up power He know he got a couple of fly in his jaw but he savor every moment before his mouth snap shut His magnanimous act is so convincing that you start to wonder if he genuinely warning them about the inevitable consequence of magic that is until his face freeze in laughter at Arthur boneheaded wish Luther Adler ha a decent performance a well if not a bit hammy The glass wish never backfire Maybe it because it so simple and innocuous but that interesting right It implies that maybe Genie isn a evil a we thought and he be more than happy to grant small meager wish Or maybe he luring them into a false sense of security Oh well it basically just a test wish anyways Guess that why they get 4 It fun that they had a test wish for that suspension of disbelief and the gag time wa pretty short And I guess Genie glass fixing ability foreshadow him fixing his bottle a if that wa something we needed to see amp x200B The worst thing about this episode is that it is predictable a all get out It play out exactly how you expect these wish episode to go with little variation or subversion The twist are predictable too Even if it wa more original in it day I still feel it a weaker episode overall Maybe show it to somebody who literally never seen this type of story ever The protagonist are likable enough and Ruskin performance should keep you entertained Contemporary cultural context doe put a damper on this one a it doe to many classic episode but this is one bottle I could do without I have a feeling there be a lot of review like this so I suppose my wish of peeking at the other side ha been granted,The Groan Zone

genie to Arabian Nights Now this episode seems to mostly be concerned with juxtaposing the genie with a fairly typical relatable couple writhing in debt I hold that this wasn an original idea even for it time but it certainly paved the way for many bottle to come From primordial superhumans to Will Smith this is another tale of another genie and the people he messing with And yes it in the Twilight Zone amp x200B Arthur Castle ha to be like the dumbest guy ever Top 10 Dumbest Twilight Zone Protags coming soon to a sub near you Head of a foreign country can be voted out of office within this century Dude aren you Jewish I don think it confirmed whether the character is Jewish but Luther Adler is and he doe have a nice kvetch to his voice Even if I hadn seen that Futurama parody this is beyond predictable I do think that if his character is Jewish it add more horror to the twist but it also make him like really really dumb I get he all caught up on the wish train but he literally trying to make a wish that doesn have consequence when the most obvious of all consequence is right under his nose in a toothbrush mustache And apparently Adler played Hitler twice before this so it might even be an in joke It a strong twist in theory but it sheer obviousness ha it fall flat He totally deserves Genie evil laughter Also it clever that the genie lamp subbed in for the cyanide bottle even though it historically inaccurate That the least of this episode problem I like that Arthur and Edna Castle are genuinely good people Usually the way these story play out is that the wishmaker or wishee is greedy and deserves to be punished for their selfish desire They get carried away but the beginning establishes that they good people who are just trying to get by I don blame them for wishing for a million dollar which would go for 8 million today or the power thing Edna doe feel a little superfluous in all this Arthur doe all the wishing She basically just there to doubt Arthur I guess technically Arthur owns the bottle but still I always appreciated the Twilight Zone minimalism including casting but to have a character that basically doe nothing in an episode with 3 major character is disappointing But enough negativity Arthur generosity to Mrs Gumley is heartwarming and it a little weird that he get punished for this Wait no he doesn Mental scar notwithstanding In fact he gain something he get 5 buck out of the deal and all of his poor friend get bundle of money I know he reset everything but the glass wasn reset until he bumped into it You could suppose that all the money they donated will get magicked away somehow but they end up appreciating what little they have and it still a happy ending at least I also like the antique shop given how minimal the setting usually are especially in the next episode it nice to see a bunch of ornate statue and ceramic and such I think I saw the Holy Grail somewhere It also cement the irony of being surrounded by this extravagant stuff while being on the verge of bankruptcy Also apparently some of the music here is used from What You Need Nice touch I love Joseph Ruskin in this He honestly make the episode I like that the smoke coming out of the bottle at first is implied to be from Genie because he sure drag that cig throughout the entire episode He come off a a subdued salesman like someone who act formal with a vague hint of the sinister You can see a glimmer of amusement a he watch the Castles debate over what to wish for Look at how he beam when Arthur brings up power He know he got a couple of fly in his jaw but he savor every moment before his mouth snap shut His magnanimous act is so convincing that you start to wonder if he genuinely warning them about the inevitable consequence of magic that is until his face freeze in laughter at Arthur boneheaded wish Luther Adler ha a decent performance a well if not a bit hammy The glass wish never backfire Maybe it because it so simple and innocuous but that interesting right It implies that maybe Genie isn a evil a we thought and he be more than happy to grant small meager wish Or maybe he luring them into a false sense of security Oh well it basically just a test wish anyways Guess that why they get 4 It fun that they had a test wish for that suspension of disbelief and the gag time wa pretty short And I guess Genie glass fixing ability foreshadow him fixing his bottle a if that wa something we needed to see amp x200B The worst thing about this episode is that it is predictable a all get out It play out exactly how you expect these wish episode to go with little variation or subversion The twist are predictable too Even if it wa more original in it day I still feel it a weaker episode overall Maybe show it to somebody who literally never seen this type of story ever The protagonist are likable enough and Ruskin performance should keep you entertained Contemporary cultural context doe put a damper on this one a it doe to many classic episode but this is one bottle I could do without I have a feeling there be a lot of review like this so I suppose my wish of peeking at the other side ha been grantedThe Groan Zone

211,JuliusHibbert,1,I wanted to contribute my 4 major point to improve this incarnation of the show Before I get into it I want to say I really happy you have brought it back This post isn meant to castigate you clearly putting a lot of effort and I a no one As a fan I hope to be helpful and supportive giving my opinion constructively is the most I can do on that front I fully recognize how difficult it must be to reboot a classic TV show Please don be discouraged because watching it ha been a highpoint of my week and I enjoyed the show besides a few minor quibble complaint Here are 4 major point I think can improve the show Fair warning there are a few small spoiler about the new series ahead 1 The Narration isn just a quirky feature it serf a function The opening and closing narration are essential element of the show It often feel like the TZ reboots have treated the narration portion a an aside or a low effort box to tick before moving on the story As I see it the intro outro purpose is two fold A The intro narration often give u a summation of the character inner world and other perspective we may not have been privy to seeing It characterizes their biggest flaw and their greatest triumph wish and aspiration This set the stage and involves u a an active participant in the show If this is skipped it at great detriment to the viewer B The closing narration often provides u with insight It delivers a message commentary or point toward something we should look for in ourselves or in society It show u that thing we just watched wa a parable and sometimes in 4 or 5 sentence we given the key to unlock it Provide Insight distribute wisdom and let u know the profundity of why it important we understand what you seeking to express 2 The Twists serve to enhance the message and serve the story not vice versa Serling primarily used the show a an avenue to deliver social commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling While not every episode of the original series wa great in the classic episode the twist ending enhances the message of what we just seen When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist and not the other way around you lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone wa trying to teach u To more effectively use a twist we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered If the twist go against the message of the episode or make the message more difficult to interpret I argue it losing some efficacy Additionally not every episode need a twist As long a the writing moral and message are strong and there is an element of the mysterious the will translate to the TZ format 3 Keep it short Pick one message and dive deeply into it I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issue of today i e social division unchecked paranoia artistry v commercialism etc That said one reason the original series wa so successful wa because each episode had one central theme obsoleteness mob mentality racism hatred etc In exploring that central theme deeply the show wa able to touch on other area a well It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issue of our day the viewpoint isn fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dive deeper than the service level I think keeping the episode to 30 35 minute picking a direction and diving deeply into exemplifying the peril of police brutality social division social medium etc will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham fist a many element into each episode a possible Keep tackling the hard topic but focus your scope 4 Don be afraid to use parable Serling wa constricted in what he wa allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the way he told story This constriction proved to be a strength a it allowed him to communicate difficult message to people who otherwise may not have listened Rather than talk about the danger of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil Rather than overtly discus the evil of racism he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark Rather than confront people fear of immigrant he used an alien who came to earth in need of help Rather than well you get the point Serling wa masterful using parable to communicate message that ran deeper than surface level viewing I think using this device would not only enhance the show it would increase conversation and repeat viewing So if anyone reading this is part of making this series I want to say thank you and you off to a great start I look forward to more episode and keep it up Also take with a grain of salt because just my two cent Thank you for reading,Lifelong fan here if anyone who work on the show lurks on this sub,I wanted to contribute my 4 major point to improve this incarnation of the show Before I get into it I want to say I really happy you have brought it back This post isn meant to castigate you clearly putting a lot of effort and I a no one As a fan I hope to be helpful and supportive giving my opinion constructively is the most I can do on that front I fully recognize how difficult it must be to reboot a classic TV show Please don be discouraged because watching it ha been a highpoint of my week and I enjoyed the show besides a few minor quibble complaint Here are 4 major point I think can improve the show Fair warning there are a few small spoiler about the new series ahead 1 The Narration isn just a quirky feature it serf a function The opening and closing narration are essential element of the show It often feel like the TZ reboots have treated the narration portion a an aside or a low effort box to tick before moving on the story As I see it the intro outro purpose is two fold A The intro narration often give u a summation of the character inner world and other perspective we may not have been privy to seeing It characterizes their biggest flaw and their greatest triumph wish and aspiration This set the stage and involves u a an active participant in the show If this is skipped it at great detriment to the viewer B The closing narration often provides u with insight It delivers a message commentary or point toward something we should look for in ourselves or in society It show u that thing we just watched wa a parable and sometimes in 4 or 5 sentence we given the key to unlock it Provide Insight distribute wisdom and let u know the profundity of why it important we understand what you seeking to express 2 The Twists serve to enhance the message and serve the story not vice versa Serling primarily used the show a an avenue to deliver social commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling While not every episode of the original series wa great in the classic episode the twist ending enhances the message of what we just seen When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist and not the other way around you lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone wa trying to teach u To more effectively use a twist we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered If the twist go against the message of the episode or make the message more difficult to interpret I argue it losing some efficacy Additionally not every episode need a twist As long a the writing moral and message are strong and there is an element of the mysterious the will translate to the TZ format 3 Keep it short Pick one message and dive deeply into it I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issue of today i e social division unchecked paranoia artistry v commercialism etc That said one reason the original series wa so successful wa because each episode had one central theme obsoleteness mob mentality racism hatred etc In exploring that central theme deeply the show wa able to touch on other area a well It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issue of our day the viewpoint isn fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dive deeper than the service level I think keeping the episode to 30 35 minute picking a direction and diving deeply into exemplifying the peril of police brutality social division social medium etc will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham fist a many element into each episode a possible Keep tackling the hard topic but focus your scope 4 Don be afraid to use parable Serling wa constricted in what he wa allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the way he told story This constriction proved to be a strength a it allowed him to communicate difficult message to people who otherwise may not have listened Rather than talk about the danger of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil Rather than overtly discus the evil of racism he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark Rather than confront people fear of immigrant he used an alien who came to earth in need of help Rather than well you get the point Serling wa masterful using parable to communicate message that ran deeper than surface level viewing I think using this device would not only enhance the show it would increase conversation and repeat viewing So if anyone reading this is part of making this series I want to say thank you and you off to a great start I look forward

live out ironic morality play for some sinister reason Like doe it feed off of the energy of the people it kidnaps and if so how many people doe it kidnap per yer amp x200B Given that there are a some rather fanatic world seen in the series doe that mean that the twilight zone creates entire planet custom built a a set piece What are the people on these planet made of and did they exist before the person arrives and do they continue to exist after the play is done How much energy would that take to fuel amp x200B Or is every one who enters the twilight zone trapped in a imaginary world in their own mind If that the case is each episode the dream of separate person Given that the original series ha 156 episode doe that mean that something rendered 156 separate unconscious at the same time Or is this spread over decade people randomly falling asleep and never waking up or do they wake up at the end of a episode I think I just described sleeping I admit im high and just finished watching the episode and these are the question that im currently obsessed with amp x200B Like do the npc of the story just pretend not to notice when the person enters the twilight zone arrives Like that Bill he run a successful flurb business he wake up in the twilight zone and the flurb never existed and that how Bill realized that the true meaning of Easter wa friendship Like the people who make up the universe where the flurb wa never invented what the fuck do they think happened Bill just had a break down and start going on about fucking flurbs Like is this a normal thing for them is Bill always going on about imaginary shit or is this the first time More importantly what the fuck happened to Bill the successful Flurb salesman Did he just wake up and not recognize any thing in his life and what the fuck is a Flurb How doe Bob the salesman family react to him not knowing anything about his own life do they flip back when he learns the secret to Easter or is a one way trip and they are forever stuck living in world that they are just slightly off from everything where everything is almost right but juuuust off Like when some one is visiting and they move your furniture two inch to the left and at the time you think nothing of it but a you lie awake a night it occurs that something is off in the living room and you will never know what it is and this is just your life now http now Is Is their every waking moment a banal existential terror at the knowledge the universe is alive at it hate them and is petty enough to personally forever fuck up Bill the flurb salesman life and his alternate flurbless double just so the salesman can learn the meaning of friend ship amp x200B Would you take comfort that the universe is alive and you can prove it is fucking with you or do you worry constantly about what the universe going to fuck you over with next Would knowing that the universe is sentient be comforting or pant shittingly terrifying Like knowing it sentient do you try to

390,Iamnotthethe,1,This is an episode from Season 4 I can say it bad Really bad Before you read my analysis go watch it I not going to explain the plot because I don understand the plot I give you a quick summary One guy stop for gas in a small town that guarding the secret of magical alien technology that can do essentially anything and they detain him because he know their secret That it Let me say why it bad The character make bad decision Say everyone in your town ha some magical Alien technology and you trying to keep it secret What the best way to keep a secret like that This town ha a completely OPEN ROAD leading into it They simply assume that due to their remote location NOBODY will ever wander in and stop for gas or food Is this stupid Yes It is established that these people can produce any food they want any object they want They have no lack of resource and nobody ever leaf they perfectly content SO WHY DO THEY HAVE AN UNGUARDED ENTRANCE INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD This would make sense Put a log in the middle of the road or a big rock so people can drive through and a sign that say Road Closed Not their big giant magical invisible forcefield a this would arouse suspicion but just a barrier that make it seem like there nothing notable back there Chances are they could just fade into obscurity like that But they have a SIGN right outside This is like if Area 51 had a day where you could come in and take all the picture of alien you wanted These people are so bad at keeping a secret and then they imprison this guy just because he happened to pick out their town at random But it go even farther than that When he first get to the town this kid us her magical alien technology to make the guy dog disappear The guy wonder how his dog disappeared and he see the kid playing with the techno thingy but her dad the gas station attendant say it just her radio and then she make his dog come back Now this seems like a reasonable excuse The guy assumes that maybe his dog just ran off somewhere for a minute and maybe it is just a radio So he drive off THIS IS A SMART CHOICE By this point the guy doesn care He ha his gas and his dog If the townspeople just let him go he WOULD NOT CARE or think about visiting this town EVER AGAIN He a newspaper reporter but he wouldn report his dog running away in some little town Seems like the townspeople have managed to keep their secret right NOPE They raise their HUGE INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD and his car literally CRASHES INTO NOTHING then his dog DIES then the townspeople bring his dog BACK TO LIFE These people do not want to be thought of a normal or hide a secret This is clear They want to be a bizarre a possible This is the only thing I can conceive of Are they idiot Dorn the mayor state in the episode that they not really evil they just want to keep their secret They don want to keep him there but they have to in order to keep their secret But he say he a prominent reporter and people will come looking for him Won they Yes they will Dorn call it the best kept secret in the world Is it Is it really You leave your town wide open you act insane and you so obviously hiding something These people just want to stand out They can sorta want to hide their secret but also keep an open connection to the outside world It one or the other The town ha a hotel and a restaurant but they not real The hotel is supposedly completely booked but all the guest are out and the restaurant is ALWAYS CLOSED Why doe the gas station work then Why would these people need gas if they never go anywhere and can have all the food they want Does this town NEED all these totally fake business everywhere to make their town seem more normal It would seem more normal to have NO restaurant or hotel than to have restaurant and hotel that ARE FAKE Some town have no restaurant or hotel They could just tell him we don have a restaurant or a hotel so you have to go somewhere else He leave Easy But that isn the worst part The worst part is at the end of the episode THEY REALIZE THAT THEY CAN JUST ERASE HIS MEMORY with their technology and restore everything back to normal so he won know what happened This render all the prior conflict completely pointless Also we supposed to feel sad that he doesn know the lady anymore It would be sad if she wa his wife BEFORE he entered the town and she had to stay there I not invested in their romance He just some random guy and she just some random lady and she betrayed him anyway and if they go their separate way then so what It a happy ending Overall this episode is bad Serling and Co really struck out with this one Twilight Zone episode are good when he character do believable thing We cheer on the people when they leave Pall imaginary apocalypse we praise Templeton when he decides to pursue his passion we identify with the guy who alone with nobody but his reflection to speak with Those are good episode This episode is bad because nobody doe anything that make sense It could be good if it wa executed properly like if the townspeople really did try to keep their technology a secret and did everything in their power to help this poor guy escape Dorn say that the last time anybody wandered in it wa 1953 What happened to that guy Did they turn his car into Spaghetti Os and then tell him nothing wa bizarre,Valley Of The Shadows suck,This is an episode from

65,SimSimeon01,0,I did a quick search and couldn find much discussion on it and most of the talk here seems centered around Marvel and DC book but I thought I ask anyway for the following reason I wa able to follow it fine up to issue six but starting with issue seven thing have gotten very confusing I reread the entire series so far a number of time and I am still at a loss It make sense up to issue six There IS stuff in there that not spelled out but it seems to be intentionally vague to create a sense of mystery or because it scary supernatural weirdness But starting in issue seven a plot point wa introduced that is very unclear to me and I wa wondering if anyone could explain to me what exactly is meant to be going on The character in the story themselves seem to understand it fine from their reaction so either I just not getting it personally or well the writing is just poor here As I said up to this point thing made sense and when something wa unclear the character in the story didn understand what wa going on either But in issue seven stop reading here a I am going to get into spoiler In issue seven Carnahan seems to be revealing that the dead refugee couple were in fact the modern holy family and that their dead newborn wa meant to be the Second Coming of Christ Carnahan killed them because he the Anti Christ Apparently all the child killing stuff wa irrelevant and Carnahan just partook in it because the vessel mean Carnahan physical body just enjoyed it This leaf me very confused because Carnahan say a number of other thing that implies he is not nor ha he ever been Carnahan He seems to say that he is the Anti Christ a separate being from Carnahan and possessed Carnahan body after he killed the refugee baby so Jesus couldn use Carnahan a his vessel instead This is very confusing for a number of reason First the Anti Christ thanks Shaw for killing Carnahan implying that he emptied the vessel of a soul so he could posse it instead of Christ There a number of problem with this One if Carnahan and the Anti Christ are separate being wouldn Carnahan soul still be occupying his body So if Christ can take the body now that the Anti Christ occupies it how could Christ take the bod if Carnahan soul wa still in it Second why would Christ second choice for a vessel be a sadistic child killer who work with pedophile to murder kid Some random middle aged guy is a weird choice why not just be born to some other couple But even if you accept that some middle aged guy is a good second option why a child killer I know Ennis isn a fan of Christianity and put blasphemy into his comic for fun but this doesn seem like an attempt to be edgy or shock ala Preacher It seems like Ennis is attempting to write a straight faced religious horror story and in that context why would Christ want to occupy the body of a serial killer who is under investigation by the police for connection to pedophile who murder kid Wouldn that make ministering to his flock or fighting the Anti Christ even more difficult than it otherwise would be Third I not even sure if Carnahan and the Anti Christ are meant to be separate being because one moment Carnahan talk like he is the Anti Christ who is just now occupying Carnahan newly dead body but in issue eight he talk about murdering his family a a child because he wa the Anti Christ all his life This would also make sense of his supernatural ability to make witness to his activity go on shooting spree and the pedophile he worked with commit suicide It pretty inconsistent and leaf me very confused Fourth why is Carnahan and or the Anti Christ continuing to fuck with the police He killed Jesus so it it kind of mission accomplished Why is he doing weird spooky shit in this warehouse Isn he just drawing unnecessary attention to himself If you were the Anti Christ wouldn you want everyone to be ignorant of the fact you stopped the Second Coming By drawing attention to it wouldn you just give people faith in God And for that matter why do all the pedophile serial killer stuff Again isn that just drawing unwanted attention to yourself if the real goal is just stop Jesus from redeeming mankind Anyway I just really baffled by all this Ennis is one of my favorite comic book writer and I never been this confused by his writing before Is there something I missing If you reading the book so far and it make perfect sense to you can you fill me in on what up I wa largely enjoying it a lot up to issue six and now I just don know what to think,Is anyone else on here reading A Walk Through Hell by Garth Ennis,I did a quick search and couldn find much discussion on it and most of the talk here seems centered around Marvel and DC book but I thought I ask anyway for the following reason I wa able to follow it fine up to issue six but starting with issue seven thing have gotten very confusing I reread the entire series so far a number of time and I am still at a loss It make sense up to issue six There IS stuff in there that not spelled out but it seems to be intentionally vague to create a sense of mystery or because it scary supernatural weirdness But starting in issue seven a plot point wa introduced that is very unclear to me and I wa wondering if anyone could explain to me what exactly is meant to be going on The character in the story themselves seem to understand it fine from their reaction so either I just not getting it personally or well the writing is just poor here As I said up to this point thing made sense and when something wa unclear the character in the story didn understand what wa going on either But in issue seven stop reading here a I am going to get into spoiler In issue seven Carnahan seems to be revealing that the dead refugee couple were in fact the modern holy family and that their dead newborn wa meant to be the Second Coming of Christ Carnahan killed them because he the Anti Christ Apparently all the child killing stuff wa irrelevant and Carnahan just partook in it because the vessel mean Carnahan physical body just enjoyed it This leaf me very confused because Carnahan say a number of other thing that implies he is not nor ha he ever been Carnahan He seems to say that he is the Anti Christ a separate being from Carnahan and possessed Carnahan body after he killed the refugee baby so Jesus couldn use Carnahan a his vessel instead This is very confusing for a number of reason First the Anti Christ thanks Shaw for killing Carnahan implying that he emptied the vessel of a soul so he could posse it instead of Christ There a number of problem with this One if Carnahan and the Anti Christ are separate being wouldn Carnahan soul still be occupying his body So if Christ can take the body now that the Anti Christ occupies it how could Christ take the bod if Carnahan soul wa still in it Second why would Christ second choice for a vessel be a sadistic child killer who work with pedophile to murder kid Some random middle aged guy is a weird choice why not just be born to some other couple But even if you accept that some middle aged guy is a good second option why a child killer I know Ennis isn a fan of Christianity

142,upyours192,0,So I read the following just to give you a list Captain America all of Golden lil bit of Silver and all of Bronze Sandman all of Golden and Bronze Challengers of the Unknown Thor 131 140 Annual 2 154 179 Fantastic Four 1 93 Annuals 1 7 X Men just the 1st ish SHIELD Atlas Kobra all of the Fourth World Saga Demon OMAC Kamandi Losers Days in the Mob Eternals 2001 Machine Man Devil Dinosaur Black Panther Silver Surfer that last one he did with Stan Lee Captain Victory Silver Star Super Powers Destroyer Duck and The Prisoner amp x200B I also got some opinion if anyone want to talk about them amp x200B First off any comic that I haven read that you think I should be him I gauge my taste from what I liked best to what I hated the most Best OMAC To Wake the Mangog Silver Star Worst Golden Age Sandman X Men Devil Dinosaur So Challengers of the Unknown is an obvious template for Fantastic Four Like even down to the random alien that picked up the Challengers is somewhat used again in FF The Fourth World Saga is an obvious continuation of Thor though a lot of the character in the Fourth World saga feel like reinterpretation of many other Marvel character Orion felt like the Hulk getting uncontrollably angry at time Lightray felt like a more mild version of the Human Torch Darkseid felt like Dr Doom a little only way more tamed down in term of showboating egotism Mister Miracle felt like a way nicer and le sexist Mr Fantastic right down to the way he would science his way out of thing and his relationship with Big Barda who felt like Thor meet Susan Storm Highfather wa a far nicer Odin Desaad felt like Loki The Forever People felt like a hippie version of The Challengers of the Unknown Big Bear felt like the antithesis to The Thing So I know that many people believe that Hunger Dogs is the ending to his Fourth World Saga but like Super Powers pick up like right after Also that Darkseid land felt like the inspiration for Grant Morrison far future JLA story where Darkseid won Devil Dinosaur felt like a poor man Kamandi Those human with super power in Kamandi felt like a super powered version of Challengers of the Unknown Darius Drumm wa like the insane ending to the constantly evolving symbolic character that represented fascism for Jack Kirby I mean obviously it started with Red Skull then Dr Doom strangely enough Hydra Kobra then Darkseid and finally Darius Drumm Am I missing anyone Would the Mad Bomb count from Cap America Maybe some of the baddie in The Losers I guess Silver Star wa the most meta and experimental I seen with Jack Kirby in term of storytelling It wa fucking insane Captain Victory wa the most Kirby in term of art I seen from him from the 80 Jesus christ 2001 wa insane OMAC is easily my favorite thing by Kirby Outside of the Mangog and Galactus v Ego story I didn care for Thor Was anyone else let down with The Losers So I noticed in many of his earlier work that hypnotism is like a really big way of dealing with enemy I saw it quite a bit for some character in his Golden Age Captain America and in Challengers of the Unknown it used a the most random way to beat enemy In FF they use it to defeat the Skrulls Doom the Doom us it Miracle Man us it etc And then hypnotism wa used many time in others story too It just seems very prevalent in his story Any one else notice that,I just read all the Jack Kirby comic I own What else by him should I read,So I read the following just to give you a list Captain America all of Golden lil bit of Silver and all of Bronze Sandman all of Golden and Bronze

143,SJW_NPC,0,Fairly new to reading comic book and just gave one of the worst comic a shot Since it looked like a fairly short read enjoyed the dynamic that I saw in the original civil war movie and it seemed appropriate since the Captain Marvel movie is currently just out in theater and she happens to be one of the most controversial figure from that comic While I fairly new to comic book I am not to storytelling and character from other medium So right now I feeling confident enough to have an opinion on character from this series since I seem to have a very strong opinion that go against almost everybody take I seen on this And while I agree that it far from the best story ever told and could been executed far better given the premise I however cannot for the life of me imagine how anybody can think that Captain Marvel is in the wrong here amp x200B I argue that the only good thing that Tony did wa investigate how the power of the inhuman work which to be fair Carol couldn really do on her own since she lacked the talent to do so amp x200B Now while both of them lose someone near and dear to them Only Tony seems like he acting out of emotion and while that might be very understandable given the context it really isn really a good point in his favor here amp x200B Captain Marvel act proactively to prevent disaster from happening and save countless life in doing so Yes she arrest people for crime they haven committed yet but I don see how that different from arresting a suspect for a murder bomb threat shooting These people aren convicted they simply put under arrest while the hero figure out the situation One could even argue from the perspective that planning to commit murder is considered a crime but I don have to since I don need to do so to defend Carol action here She isn convicting people for crime they didn commit she simply putting them under arrest Contrast that to Tony who spends most of his time demonizing Carol and whose only argument seems to be Captain America is on my side therefore I am right Hell it even revealed later that he trusted Carol with the situation but wouldn trust someone else with that same responsibility yet wasn able to articulate those thought The nail in the coffin is towards the end when Captain Marvel seems to be remedying the situation with spider man and Captain America but get attacked by Iron Man The good guy Then get his as kicked You can even argue that Carol is a Mary Sue because she get humbled quite a few time during this series Honestly it kinda reminds me of the absolute hatred people had for Korra from the Avatar series People seem to really hate the cocky brash confident and strong female lead no matter how well it executed and will hate the character regardless amp x200B What the hell am I missing here I can see how people didn think the comic wa good that a whole other subject but thinking the Captain Marvel wa so in the wrong that it made you hate her I cannot for the life

changing brain chemestry he can take an antidepressant Or a mood stablizer He deal with his mental problem in full force day in day out And he still stick through it like a trooper trying to be funny

389,Old_Ironsides_58,0,Where do you turn when a big huge company like ReedPop Reed Exhibitions that run 500 event worldwide each year and ha a gross income of 9 5 billion each year doe you wrong This is a story that begin on October 6th last year at the NYC Comic Con but in way it actually begin all the way back in 1974 I wa sixteen year old back in 74 and attending my first Comic Book Convention in NYC There I received the 100 page program book that I still have to this day Back then artist and writer were only to happy to autograph your program for you and many would throw in a quick sketch too I wa thrilled to get over 20 autograph that year including such luminary a Neal Adams Jeff Jones and Jim Steranko just to name a few While I never lost my love of comic book I did drift away from them while in college and in the early year of raising a family I returned to them in the early 90 and have attended many a convention since then That program now contains over 200 different autograph and amazingly nearly 100 tiny sketch in the margin So when Alex Ross wa doing a promotional signing of Marvelocity with Chip Kidd at the NYC Comic Con this past fall I jumped at the chance He doe so few signing and Marvels wa one of my biggest favorite from the early 90 Alex never charge a fan for an autograph at this event you were purchasing the book from Penguin ReedPop which he would sign Also he would sign an additional second item for you I wa looking forward to adding his autograph to the 200 I already had in my 1974 program The signing ran from 1 30 to 3 00 I arrived at 1 15 and a one might expect many had arrived earlier As the line advance soon there were over 60 people behind me After over an hour we were herded onto an extremely large elevator and taken up to the floor for the signing What followed wa truly unfortunate We we told to stay in the elevator which then returned to the ground floor We were then informed that Alex wa spending longer with each fan than expected and we would not be able to meet him a promised a he had a prior engagement scheduled immediately after 3pm Our ticket were taken from u with multiple apologizes and the promise of a refund or a book a soon a they could arrange it While disappointed at my age you understand that these thing happen As you might expect it wasn the book that I wa looking forward to nor wa it obtaining Alex autograph What ha always meant the most to me is that brief encounter with those who imagination and talent entertain awe and inspire u that is what I treasure It matter not whether it is a name we all know or someone who ha just published their first comic book Imagine how it felt afterwards to discover from the people at Alex Ross Art that ReedPop had turned away those last 60 fan without first informing Alex Once Alex knew his team tried to find those who might still be in the area but sadly nearly all of u had dispersed Then to add insult to injury what followed over the next 3 month we multiple email in which I requested a refund that month after month never came Penguin Random House had attempted to arrange the refund but since ReedPop had collected the 66 00 it had to come from them My request achieved nothing my follow ups went nowhere and even threat were simply ignored Not once did ReedPop send me an email update or respond to my inquires Then something rather unique happened I had copied Eli at Alex Ross Art on some of the email and unbeknown to me they to had been working behind the scene since the beginning of January to try and get ReedPop to fix this They too had gotten nowhere with the multi billion dollar corporation However they were determined that this treatment wa not acceptable and asked me to send them a copy of my online ticket receipt for the event to aid in pursuing the issue They even promised to refund me what I had paid even though they never received a single penny of it I provided them with the requested evidence and they once again went to bat for the little guy This Monday ReedPop at long last contacted me stating that they had figured out why I hadn received the refund and it had now been processed Then yesterday a package arrived via UPS from the people at Alex Ross Art it wa a literal Swap Bag of goody containing over a dozen item including 3 signed print I have wonderful story of those I met over the 45 year that I been carrying around that program from 1974 Of how Moebius actually wrote a tiny greeting to his friend Sergio Aragonés back in 93 that Sergio then read 22 year later at SDCC Of winning a futuristic prop used in the TV series The Expanse while meeting James S A Corey Yeah both of them How Janet Lee and I have become friend when we discovered we both create hand made Christmas Tree ornament each year These are but a few of the many Though I never got to meet him of all the story I have how Alex Ross and his people stepped in for the little 6o year old guy is certainly finest and I wanted to share it with

457,Dubwell,0,Once Upon a Deadpool wa not perfect by any mean but it wa way better than it should of been and it ha me more excited for the future of Marvel and Deadpool now It also made the flaw of Deadpool 2 more evident Let me start this off by saying Deadpool 2 is my favorite of the 3 Deadpool movie 4 if you include the super duper cut The reason why Deadpool 2 is my favorite is because it wa the most comic accurate Deadpool in term of Wade Wilson being human He had real emotion and it wa great The other reason is that Deadpool 1 seemed like it wa strictly for shock value while making deadpool more like the internet version of Deadpool It wa still a good film that wa funny but it wasn my Deadpool and that ok I don expect them to make a character identical to the comic since character change and evolve with time Plus movie and humor are subjective When I heard Deadpool 2 would have a PG 13 version I wa intrigued but scared I mean how can they remove the violence language and joke Well after watching Once Upon a Deadpool twice I am really surprised with how much of the movie still worked Let look at the bad of it first though They seriously dropped the ball with the beginning of the movie The beginning wa so choppy They removed my favorite action scene they removed the blood they omitted the Logan joke and the cocaine joke which they totally could of pushed for These are problem that could been handled better The problem is they couldn reshoot the stuff and they didn plan the fight scene around a PG 13 The rating wasn the main issue it wa the fact they had to work with pre shot footage They also played it VERY safe PG 13 movie can have blood Like a lot more than they showed They also removed joke that were totally ok like the mcrib joke and the prison wallet sound fx Let get to why I loved the movie despite those flaw Deadpool acted and talked more like Deadpool from the comic He wa more meta and his joke weren reliant on swearing to be funny He wa more absurd and creative with his expletive The bleeping wa clever a hell and acted just like the swearing symbol in the comic Some of the redone joke were actually better in some case too though that is subjective Overall it just felt more like Deadpool from the actual comic This also made me so happy since it mean that Deadpool isn about a rating but it the character and the joke So many of the joke in the original used profanity a a crutch This is the flaw I never noticed with Deadpool 2 Seriously I never realized how much of Deadpool 1 and 2 were just sex joke said differently with random noun There are time where I laughed even though it wasn funny or well written but because he dropped some f bomb The problem with that is they wear off after and lose their impact after over use Once upon a Deadpool got creative with the censorship which in itself if more clever than just crude humor If they announced a PG 13 Deadpool movie now I don think I would be too upset I think they would have much more blood and violence than Once Upon a Deadpool offered It also wouldn be a disjointed film since they could film around the restriction They can take the restriction and use them a a way to get more clever joke In fact the joke would have to rely on clever writing instead of the shock value the movie seem to rely on To be honest the movie got me hyped since there is a very real chance that Deadpool can appear in mainstream Marvel movie and the movie show that he can work very well in a PG 13 Spiderpool can actually happen now Sorry for my writing style and thanks for reading TLDR

482,Donna201299,0,the Green Lanterns specifically Hal John Guy and Kyle These four men each fill in the same role often at the same time yet have completely different personality that make them more than just another Action Hero Hal Jordan is often cited a generic and many detractor neutral on the character say that he just a generic Silver Age Character Allow me to defend Hal for a moment here because I always seen that notion a a bit unfair Hal is often praised by modern writer a THE Green Lantern The Best of the Corps and that never made much sense to me because of how Hal character tick Hal is not a leader nor is he a follower he a lone agent a fearless loyal thrill seeker with arguably self destructive reckless behaviour stemming from childhood scar but an ethical code equal to Superman even though he slightly more willing to kill than Big Blue even if he doesn like it Outside of his heroic he an Air Force Test Pilot a job that let him literally fly solo on thrilling flight detached from the rest of the world akin to how his role a a Lantern ha detached him from the rest of the Earth more and more over the year John Stewart is very different He an ex marine a sniper to be precise and a former archaeologist both role require focus seriousness efficiency and precision all thing John ha in spade Like Hal he detached from the Earth though John is far more detached than Hal will ever be a Hal will always going back for Carol while John who ha a confessed preference for alien woman seems to go more exotic with time He orderly organised and sharp minded with a mind for philosophy and ethical debate He prefers efficiency to flashy substance hence his frequently mundane usage of the Ring he rather take someone down quickly and efficiently over a big light show Out of these four John is the one most suited to lead the Lanterns by far Hal great at solo mission Guy great in all out brawl and Kyle great at being a Wild Card One Man Army but none of them have John ability to lead Guy Gardner is complicated Most people look at him and just see the man who got hit by a bus and got One Punched by Batman and a such dismiss him a The Dumb Brute One which is sad because Guy had a fascinating history beyond being a bruiser He had two main job before becoming a Lantern a Social Welfare Caseworker and a Teacher of Disabled Children Yeah that right Guy Gardner the Lantern whose often characterised a an oafish idiotic loser who only care about himself and whose face his fist is going to connect to next dedicated his life to caring for child and inmate going through rehabilitation This alone make Guy a fascinating character a man with such outward aggression yet seems to be one of the most caring character we covered so far but we not done yet You see the reason Guy quit the casework job wa because his aggression from his teenage year wa beginning to seep out of him His teenage self wa a delinquent whose behaviour stemmed from a particularly horrible childhood of abuse neglect and failed attempt to get positive attention from his father that he only coped with through his love of comic book General Glory story to be precise A lot of people including DC if the New 52 historical rewrite mean anything choose to ignore a lot of this a Early Instalment Weirdness but I choose to use all this information a a basis for why Guy doe what he doe At the end of the day he a bitter cynical jerk with anger issue that doesn trust authority figure and love beating people up but he also imaginative loyal devoted to helping the le fortunate willing to fight to his last breath to save the universe and ha a fascinating tendency to see the best in people even if he frequently get envious of those truly noble quality He a truly flawed hero and while he actually my least favourite Lantern because of how often he just shown a a dick with none of the pathos that make him interesting beyond that I have to respect him for that Kyle Rayner is weird out of place and shouldn work a a Lantern Not a a character in a piece of fiction of course if anything his creative nature make him perfect a a user for a multi tool like the Green Lantern Ring No In Universe Kyle make absolutely no sense a a member of a Police Force operation like the Green Lantern Corps He like one of those young kid who were mandated to go to war during WWI obviously not suited for it but the circumstance forced him to However all thing considered he made the best of the situation The reason why I described him a The Wild Card One Man Army earlier wa because Kyle mind is that of a very good artist creative unique and weird This kid ha the most destructive potential out of any GL ever due to the power of his mind Hal the best solo act John the best leader and Guy the best throw down fighter but Kyle could easily take out all of them by simply letting his imagination run loose This kid even made Batman freak out once with his dangerous potential He a dork but an immensely powerful creative dork and that what make him an effective Lantern Special credit to Danny buckle,Why these Green Lanterns are more compelling than you think,the Green Lanterns specifically

of how often he just shown a a dick with none of the pathos that make him interesting beyond that I have to respect him for that Kyle Rayner is weird out of place and shouldn work a a Lantern Not a a character in a piece of fiction of course if anything his creative nature make him perfect a a user for a multi tool like the Green Lantern Ring No In Universe Kyle make absolutely no sense a a member of a Police Force operation like the Green Lantern Corps He like one of those young kid who were mandated to go to war during WWI obviously not suited for it but the circumstance forced him to However all thing considered he made the best of the situation The reason why I described him a The Wild Card One Man Army earlier wa because Kyle mind is that of a very good artist creative unique and weird This kid ha the most destructive potential out of any GL ever due to the power of his mind Hal the best solo act John the best leader and Guy the best throw down fighter but Kyle could easily take out all of them by simply letting his imagination run loose This kid even made Batman freak out once with his dangerous potential He a dork but an immensely powerful creative dork and that what make him an effective Lantern Special credit to Danny buckleWhy these Green Lanterns are more compelling than you think

kindness of their own heart recurring discussion Real talk for all their speech of supporting the Direct Market DC and MArvel number 1 priority is themselves AND YOU CAN T BLAME THEM FOR IT THEY ARE BUSINESSES Look at DC It went from a company that wa super communicative with retailer and incredibly supporting to one that decided to give a Tom King and Andy Kubert story to Wallmart I dunno maybe they got big money for that Maybe Mr Wall Mart really love comic and wanted some exclusive But they literally cut out their number 1 partner retailer in the direct market out of something that we could sell since our customer actually know these creator It wa puzzling but just another show of how comic book store are seen by the corporation But hey we still be here to welcome them back with open arm if this thing fails Because retailer are sucker for punishment You know when everyone talk about how comic are doomed and publisher are the devil blah blah You know who the retailer online aren blaming Retailers You know whose fault it is that we have 750 million variant per month Retailers because they the one that buy them in the first place Marvel isn to blame that there are 1 in 500 variant Retailers are because year of their practice and speculation lead to this Retailers that spent their life only selling DC and Marvel and not building a diverse customer base are in danger now Because this is a different market And some are having a really hard time with it The entire situation the industry is living now There isn one single culprit It all of u The Direct Market remember we talking single issue here is a delicate ecosystem And we been in the middle of our very own Climate Change for a good while So what can we do improve thing The Direct Market NEEDS returnability We won be able to raise our order and try to get more customer in store in the current climate when we are being asked to take on all the responsibility Retailers are expected to buy all these comic from publisher buy them outright you don get to return what you don sell and then do the marketing ourselves and sell them to customer And hopefully we turn a profit THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE You not even marketing your own book comic company An ad for NIGHTWING on BATMAN isn marketing You talking to the same audience How is it that these massive mega company can market anything to save their life Retailers have to shoulder all of these different expense of the business so the publisher can make a much money a possible and we don even get treated a real business partner We are constantly asked to buy not order BUY book without knowing what happens in them or sometimes who the creative team even is That that doesn work like that anywhere else I mean I love Chip and totally get why he want to keep people in suspense DAREDEVIL 1 but I not people I a business partner and Marvel should have not kept me in the dark It business Creators should be free to create and not have to worry about marketing when they working for a corporation Corporations have people that do just that marketing Put them to use Example I love the creator in the upcoming AGE OF X MAN stuff All brilliant talented people Pre order on that are nearly zero because no one know really what is Because marketing for this is let put something on Newsarama and call it a day Those creator are fighting an uphill battle and they seem to have almost no support from the publisher What the point of releasing a book you don believe in 100 Do you want to sell it or not The company don care Because they know they sell enough copy to make it or at least not lose money and that enough Why spend money on marketing and potentially get new customer if you happy with milking the usual people for more You know why you are seeing all these announcement of new series selling out in the first 5 minute Of 2 selling out even before coming out Because publisher aren overprinting They rather not take that risk They rather YOU the customer wait week for a second printing potentially never coming back for it Retailers aren ordering a many comic a before so publisher print these thing a close to the bone Then they can joyfully announce that they sold out in record time gee whizz If you have order of 10 for an 1 and you print 10 5 because you rather get the sigh marketing bump of THIS WAS SO HOT THAT IT S ALREADY GOING INTO SECOND PTG BEFORE COMIGN OUT you not helping retailer or more important the customer If you putting out weekly series with no returnability and where retailer are buying 5 or 10 issue sight unseen You not helping Retailers are here to sell a many comic a possible but it incredible how our business partner make it so hard It really shouldn be this way It doesn have to be this way

improve thing The Direct Market NEEDS returnability We won be able to raise our order and try to get more customer in store in the current climate when we are being asked to take on all the responsibility Retailers are expected to buy all these comic from publisher buy them outright you don get to return what you don sell and then do the marketing ourselves and sell them to customer And hopefully we turn a profit THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE You not even marketing your own book comic company An ad for NIGHTWING on BATMAN isn marketing You talking to the same audience How is it that these massive mega company can market anything to save their life Retailers have to shoulder all of these different expense of the business so the publisher can make a much money a possible and we don even get treated a real business partner We are constantly asked to buy not order BUY book without knowing what happens in them or sometimes who the creative team even is That that doesn work like that anywhere else I mean I love Chip and totally get why he want to keep people in suspense DAREDEVIL 1 but I not people I a business partner and Marvel should have not kept me in the dark It business Creators should be free to create and not have to worry about marketing when they working for a corporation Corporations have people that do just that marketing Put them to use Example I love the creator in the upcoming AGE OF X MAN stuff All brilliant talented people Pre order on that are nearly zero because no one know really what is Because marketing for this is let put something on Newsarama and call it a day Those creator are fighting an uphill battle and they seem to have almost no support from the publisher What the point of releasing a book you don believe in 100 Do you want to sell it or not The company don care Because they know they sell enough copy to make it or at least not lose money and that enough Why spend money on marketing and potentially get new customer if you happy with milking the usual people for more You know why you are seeing all these announcement of new series selling out in the first 5 minute Of 2 selling out even before coming out Because publisher aren overprinting They rather not take that risk They rather YOU the customer wait week for a second printing potentially never coming back for it Retailers aren ordering a many comic a before so publisher print these thing a close to the bone Then they can joyfully announce that they sold out in record time gee whizz If you have order of 10 for an 1 and you print 10 5 because you rather get the sigh marketing bump of THIS WAS SO HOT THAT IT S ALREADY GOING INTO SECOND PTG BEFORE COMIGN OUT you not helping retailer or more important the customer If you putting out weekly series with no returnability and where retailer are buying 5 or 10 issue sight unseen You not helping Retailers are here to sell a many comic a possible but it incredible how our business partner make it so hard It really shouldn be this way It doesn have to be this way RETAILERS Join ComicsPro We have a louder voice when we talk a one No one is going to help u we have to help ourselves CUSTOMERS Keep being wonderful and spending money in your favourite comic book store Word of warning though more and more store are cutting order a much a possible and if you not there on Wednesday or have a pull list you might miss out We seen a big increase in order since we started using ComicHub Customers are definitely getting savvier about ordering comic and now we have even LESS stuff going on the shelf If your local shop ha it open an account on ComicHub to manage your order If they don it grand Start a pull list Tell the folk at the counter what stuff you into and what you want to buy all that help Again almost all the store we know are trimming order a much a possible don miss out Publishers Some of you are already amazing and we love you so much The other one let see how we can work together more We can sell more comic TOGETHER Let get into 2019 and work it out okDiscussion The Big Bang Comics Discussion on Business

604,GrayGhostt,0,The new Green Lantern run is really good with a lot to dig into but there been one recurring comment that pop up which I wanted to discus The notion of Morrison ignoring continuity for his run which considering his great body of work seems quite an odd criticism to me The bulk of it emerges from Morrison not following up the 2 page epilogue to Hal n Pals which feature Carol and Hal embracing but there an issue there Morrison wrote his script way ahead of time and is currently working on 11 the issue meant to come out September of 2019 which is crazy ahead of time for a monthly book so what he wrote came in way ahead of time and wa all done and set in stone before Hal n Pals epilogue wa ever even done Beyond that Venditti himself is the writer that tore down the Carol Hal relationship more than anyone else Johns spent a great deal of time and effort bringing them together again and writing their dynamic and relationship wherever he could over the course of his 9 year tenure Then Venditti tore it all down in his very first issue after the beautiful Green Lantern 20 conclusion with not even a second hesitation The justification given at the time for this wa also quite frankly ridiculous I quote it here for the sake of context gt N So what are your feeling about Carol Ferris In your first issue you had Hal and Carol break up again Is her relationship with Hal something you just see a being played out or do you have plan for her gt RV I think Carol is an amazing character I love her and I feel like what happened between her and Hal Carol dump him in issue 21 is just something that I feel like a woman who is a strong and commanding a her would do And just because her and Hal are on the out at the present moment doesn mean that she doesn have a key role to play in all of the Green Lantern title and not just to Hal and the main Green Lantern book specifically Now having done this his tenure also saw the fairly awful issue where Carol who still with Kyle tell Hal that maybe they be together again which is pretty not great to say the least Venditti not only ripped apart the work Johns did and tore down the relationship but over the 85 issue of GL he wrote majority of if not all Carol moment revolve around or are tied to how Carol no longer love Hal and doe not wish to be with him You can break something that wa earned over the course of year of storytelling like that ignore it and then pretend it all fine again in a 2 page epilogue What about Carol Where is she right now emotionally How doe she feel We not given any of this a Carol thrown aside and never really used especially during the course of the Hal n Pals era We get Soranik poor turn random new OC character like Sarko get full arc but Carol get nothing What happened can be fixed via a I broke the toy here they kinda how I found them 2 pager You have to work for it you have to build what wa broken again You have to put in the work You have to earn it It why the criticism baffle me since Venditti never did that work he just utilized a fan service moment to mark the end of his era They not even together again they see each other embrace kiss and that it That not a relationship or them dating again This is all putting aside all the other various instance of throwing out continuity in his tenure from blowing up everything in the Sinestro run the true successor to Johns GL both figuratively and literally to regressing of Sinestro and more Morrison read Venditti stuff early on which is how he came up with The Blackstars a he read every issue of Green Lantern and all of Hal story alongside every sci fi DC collection he could get his hand on to build his GL run His run ha had intern going through ton of old comic to get information on old long lost character and concept The guy is the champion of everything is canon and is the guy that wrote Batman and Multiversity the guy who used Electric Blue Superman in Rock of Ages he not the one to ignore continuity His run pick up on a facet of Hal that even Johns run stated quite blatantly http i imgur com D7v60ZJ png and having spoken to Sharp about the book it about a man that very specifically been through the end of day in Johns run and having seen all that the universe ha to offer and exploring where this guy who been good bad dead everything you can ever be is right now and how he feel It brought back Eve Doremus the silver age love interest who loved Hal for Hal Jordan and not Green Lantern in contrast to Carol which is what Hal always deeply longed for It set to bring back all of his love interest and plan to examine Hal through his relationship This is a run that care deeply for continuity and history It evident when you see Morrison speak on it and Carol herself gt He ha a lot of woman Hal had a lot of girlfriend and female character he connected with over the year and we bringing them all back Carol Ferris is his one true love with spark and fire but we wanted to bring back all these different woman from his past They all have different relationship with him and they not all sexual relationship Some have a problem with him some really like him and their husband hate him we playing a lot more with this guy who appears in your life suddenly and now Green Lantern sleeping on your couch for the next week What are you going to do with him gt We want to explore all of those relationship and also all of Hal Jordan previous relationship in the book So Tom Kalmaku in issue 3 We do see a little bit of the Justice League but they been beaten They only just been beaten and Hal come to save the day And all of the female character that have been in the book we bringing all of them back and they all have very different relationship with Hal completely different approach to him gt So he surrounded by this constellation of people that I think they love him more than he even know and he doesn understand He doesn quite get it But I want to build another picture of him from their point of view We looking at all of his friend all of his lover and bringing them all back and using them a mirror Hal clearly ha a journey here a he start off where he doe Carol is his true love but he also ha this vast history with a myriad of character with whom he ha vastly different relationship and dynamic We not only getting to see Hal but the book is set to be about what Hal mean to everybody else from Oliver Queen Tom Kalmaku to even Barry Allen Barry in Season 2 If Hal ha to be with Carol again it ha to be earned it can just be a cheap 2 pager it can just not address Carol and how she feeling and where she at we need all of that A Hal that go through a great journey while dealing with all his history and then ha a heart to heart with his true love where we learn his perspective feel a lot more compelling to me and that really what we the fan I feel should get rather than a random epilogue This is a run that love and adores Hal great and rich history the team isn actively ignoring it it adding to it and building on it It why we get Controller Mu and the Blackstars a separatist sect that permit u to have Evil Darkstars without having to make the Darkstars full on bad guy a that not what that concept is meant for and in the long run it not sustainable It why we get Evil Star or Belzebeth who is a mix of Legion of Super Heroes

839,dancing_goldfish,0,What ha been your impression of Marvel year My personal opinion wa that it suffered from being a transitional year between Alonso and Cenulski A lot of the first half of the year felt like treading water waiting for the relaunch we knew wa coming We got author doing alternate reality or future storyline rather than anything substantial with the character Most title peaked in 2017 and fizzled out in early 2018 Bendis jumped ship and his book wound up Cap wa stuck in a weird post secret empire limbo where nobody wanted to talk about secret empire So he went into the future a did Laura Other title got stronger ending such a Mighty Thor and Amazing Spider Man The second half of the year wa probably a rebound with a lot of title getting stronger with relaunch Personally I enjoyed it le than most reviewer but then I not the audience for the whole back to basic approach I more interested in Miles Riri Amadeus and Jane Thor and found the return of Tony Odinson and Banner a bit same old same old It all felt le exciting and more average to me That said plenty of people found a lot to like in the new Hulk in particular and Spencer Spider Man show promise Coates Cap look to be dealing with the post Secret Empire fallout that everyone else wa too nervous to touch I characterise the Thor relaunch a boring but pretty but there no denying it pretty And Cates Venom is getting some hot review though I personally haven gotten much from it yet So overall I say that Marvel rebounded a bit with fresh start even while I personally am le interested and looking more toward Image and smaller company I haven mentioned the X line much because I struggling to characterise their year It felt kind of chaotic I feel like a bit of the X momentum from the previous year wa lost both Gold and Blue felt like they lost focus a bit and neither really built to a climax Tom Taylor X Men Red started massively strong out of the gate but probably needed to be bimonthly because it felt like it lost momentum and kind of drifted into an early retirement The Hunt for Wolverine felt badly managed with too many inconsequential mini that went nowhere and Return of Wolverine ha so far been pretty lacklustre I don read Deadpool but so far Skottie Young seems to be exciting people le than Duggan run I guess this sound negative but there have been positive too Writers like Kelly Thompson Donny Cates Matt Rosenberg have reinvigorated the writing pool a bit and others like Coates and Spencer and Ewing seem to be consolidating and improving I think more than anything we need to see some long run on book to let them really develop Anyway those are my off the cuff thought How about you,Marvel 2018,What ha been your impression of Marvel year My personal
