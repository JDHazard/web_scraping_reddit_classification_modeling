27,OneTrueBrody,1,Hooooooooo boy Season Four is the most infamous one of the series thanks to the controversial decision to have hour long episode Some people think that The Twilight Zone wasn meant to have anything but half hour episode but I of the mind that hour long episode could have worked if done properly A longer runtime provides more opportunity to expand upon a concept or spend more time on character development So did Season Four take advantage of the runtime to create compelling television For the most part no I gonna come out and say it there only ONE episode of the entire season that needed to be an hour long That not to say there weren other episode that I consider good or even great but when the runtime becomes an issue for nearly every episode there is a serious problem Full disclosure I took a break from writing this because I wa starting to feel burnt out and I realized I wa just repeating myself because I have very little to say about most of these episode I coming back to this after a few week so this isn going to be the most detailed list I done partially because I blanking on some specific part of these episode and partially because I just want to get this over with and move on to Season 5 Anyway on with the show 18 The Bard A lot of the bad Season Four episode are bad in a way that isn even interesting to talk about and there isn a whole lot to say about The Bard besides it suck Burt Reynolds chewing the scenery is the only thing worth enjoying in this piece of shit episode that feel like Rod Serling wa trying to pull a fast one on the network executive and sponsor that meddled with his script I all for a bit of meta commentary but the episode ha to be good for the commentary to land and The Bard is about a far from good a an episode can get Plenty of Twilight Zone episode leave me with unanswered question but all I left with here is why doe William Shakespeare feel the need to quote himself and cite the specific line he referencing like a 10th grade English student I don even want to talk about the absolutely meaningless story if I said a failed writer conjures William Shakespeare to write script for him and made you come up with a story in your head whatever you come up with would probably have more direction than The Bard This episode would have sucked a a half hour affair but being an hour long made it nothing short of insufferable On that note I want to point out that Rod Serling may be the king of half hour television but he seemed to struggle with the hour long format of Season Four and it show in The Bard 17 I Dream of Genie Some episode get criticized for not feeling like a Twilight Zone episode and I never understood that complaint The Twilight Zone ha episode ranging from Eye of the Beholder to Once Upon a Time to A Passage For Trumpet nothing off the table really But with I Dream of Genie I totally get it The Twilight Zone element is minimal at best 90 of it is just a dude daydreaming about what his wish would be I didn actively dislike it Howard Morris is entertaining enough to make the time pas but there nothing in this episode that feel like something out of The Twilight Zone There no social commentary no relationship with the paranormal or supernatural no spectacular writing hell it doesn even have the hacky shoddiness that the bad episode are known for As for the episode we did get it just a series of vignette with nothing worth talking about 16 Passage on the Lady Anne While Passage on the Lady Anne is far from the most well liked Season 4 episode I seem to be in the minority of people who outright despise it Some people like it for it character development it an episode more focused on it character than it concept On some level I can appreciate that and I would definitely call Alan and Elaine well developed character but a huge part of why The Twilight Zone work for me is the concept it explores and how the concept help fuel the character development story message pathos etc The concept of Passage on the Lady Anne is so poorly developed that I don even know how to describe it The idea of the ship having supernatural element is barely explored until the ending when we just told that the Lady Anne died on her way back to her home planet As for the plot it just a bunch of scene that are hardly connected in any meaningful way For example the McKenzies say that Alan and Elaine don have to die before an ad break and when we return it never brought up again We treated to a whole bunch of half assed treatise on love and how the old way are being done away with but it all so unfocused that I couldn get a read on any sort of story they were telling besides Alan and Elaine marriage being in shamble I say it right now Charles Beaumont wrote 6 episode this season and this is far and away his only bad one 15 Of Late I Think of Cliffordville Twilight Zone actor who star in more than one episode are almost always fantastic actor Jack Klugman Burgess Meredith John Anderson etc Albert Salmi is an exception Of all the actor who have appeared in three or more episode he one of the only one I can think of that wa never all that good in any of them He never outright terrible but he never elevates any episode that he in Case in point Of Late I Think of Cliffordville It funny a commercial came on before this episode telling me to think about my eye and maybe I should have taken that to heart because the old age makeup Salmi had to wear wa painful to look at I know the show wa fighting against budget restraint but they were able to pull it off in Long Live Walter Jameson so there no excuse Pretty much every episode with a deal with the devil story ha an idiot for a main character but Feathersmith is a special kind of idiot Part of that ha to do with the character not being written all that well but part of that also ha to do with Albert Salmi not having the charisma to make this character work onscreen Salmi famously hated film TV acting that may have something to do with it Julie Newmar and John Anderson are great but their talent are wasted because they play second banana to Salmi who never should have been in this role in the first place With a different lead actor I may have liked it more but I doubt it 14 No Time Like the Past What could have been a decent half hour episode wa turned into a pointless hour of television Paul Driscoll can change the past This is a lesson that wa learned in the first twenty minute when he couldn evacuate Hiroshima like five fucking minute before the bomb drop kill Hitler or change the course of the Lusitania again five minute before it get torpedoed yet somehow this episode managed to last fifty goddamn minute He not unable to change the past because the past is written in stone he unable to change the past because he a fucking moron Those first twenty minute were absolutely irrelevant this episode could have started with Paul going to 1881 to stop Garfield assassination and moved on from there and nothing would have been different That probably wouldn have saved No Time Like the Past the acting wa pretty lackluster throughout especially from Abby and the writing isn all that inspired outside of some FANTASTIC dialogue during the dinner scene The dinner scene is the only scene I actually enjoyed it wa the only moment in the entire episode where Serling showed u why he one of the best writer in the history of television It a scene so good that it genuinely baffling how much the rest of the episode suck 13 The Incredible World of Horace Ford The Incredible World of Horace Ford shouldn have been an hour long episode I enjoyed about 10 15 minute worth of material which would have been thin even for a half hour episode but with a runtime of over an hour it damn near interminable This episode wa full of filler so many theme and scene were repeated nearly verbatim and it just got old I also really didn like his mother it would have been cool if she wa similar to the mother in Young Man Fancy but she given no character so she add nothing to the story That not to say nothing worked in this episode I love the idea of Horace Ford a a character but he the type of character who work best in small dos so following him for an hour got pretty grating I also thought the story they told wa pretty good it ha shade of Walking Distance and the aforementioned Young Man Fancy but the execution really suffers due to the runtime With one exception no other Season 4 episode suffers more from it runtime the part I did enjoy were dragged on too long and the rest of the episode is pure filler 12 Mute The premise of a little girl losing the only people that she could communicate with is one worth exploring and if Mute stuck to that it would have been fantastic The part of the episode that do line up with that premise are the best part like the time when she read people mind and especially the moment when she reflects on how she learned about boat without word More of that would have been nice but the story end up being a bit of a mess Not a complete mess but there wa too much drama for it own good Cora burning the letter wa dumb and selfish and I don like how that decision doesn bite her in the as at all in the end I totally get her motivation but this aspect of the episode wa really unnecessary Mommy issue wa a really weird recurring theme this season and I don understand why because it wa never good This is an episode that really didn need to be an hour long even immediately after watching it I didn have a whole lot to say about it 11 Jess Belle I can believe I saying this but I really liked Jess Belle Yes I enjoyed one of the episode that almost universally considered bottom ten material Were there problem though Absolutely Earl Hamner wrote this script in about a week with absolutely no revision and boy doe it show This episode could have ended with Jaguar Jess being killed by Billy Ben but we had to add one of the most tacked on ending the show ever produced This wa a story that should have been no more than 25 minute there wasn a whole lot of filler so to speak but the story really didn need to be extended to an hour There also a bit of a tone problem despite how absolutely ridiculous the story can get it all weirdly melodramatic Speaking of how ridiculous this episode get I don think I ever laughed harder in my life than I did when Jess Belle turned into a damn leopard Despite all that working against the episode I did enjoy it The plot could have been executed a lot better but I liked the story they were trying to tell Part of that had to do with the rather engaging performance especially from Billy Ben The set design wa gorgeous I don know why but when this show try to go for a southern charm I seem to like it more than most fan It easy to see this episode for all the flaw that it objectively ha but it just a easy to forget that this isn one of those episode where absolutely nothing work 10 The Thirty Fathom Grave When Rod Serling clearly had trouble filling the new runtime take a shot every time I say this and you be dead which is a damn shame because a lot of the episode he wrote could have been classic in a different season The Thirty Fathom Grave feel like two half hour episode that were loosely connected at best In one story we have Chief Bell having a bout of PTSD and in the other we have the mystery of the sunken submarine Either would have made for an excellent episode on their own but combining them together didn bring out anything special Simon Oakland performance a Captain Beecher wa the highlight he added some much needed weight to this overly long slow affair 9 Miniature Every season of The Twilight Zone ha one fan favorite that I just can get behind Season One ha Mirror Image Season Two ha The Silence Season Three ha Five Characters in Search of an Exit and representing Season Four is Miniature That not to say Miniature is bad but there nothing here that I haven seen in other episode There are reason why it a fan favorite though and I imagine a lot of that ha to do with Robert Duvall performance a Charlie Charlie is a well meaning yet socially awkward oddball and Duvall performance is heartfelt without losing the weirdness that make Charlie stand out I don really think the miniature gimmick wa all that creative but the cinematography make the dollhouse scene my favorite in the episode Where this episode begin to lose me is it story So many episode have plot that could be boiled down to a man doesn fit in with the world around him so he loses himself in one of his own creation but those story are only ever interesting to me when they break from that formula like in A Stop at Willoughby Miniature come very close to doing something special with the formula by having some scene in the dollhouse reflect event in Charlie life but I never felt like they committed to that premise For example it felt like the girl in the dollhouse getting abused could have been a metaphor for his sister relationship with her boyfriend but moment like those are rare and don ultimately play into the ending This wasn a bad episode at all I just don see it a the best episode of Season 4 8 Printer Devil There only so many way to tell a deal with the devil story for the most part once you seen one you seen em all That really not the case with Printer Devil which feel like a fresh take on an old format The audience is told right away that Smith is the devil but Winston doesn know what up until it almost too late On one hand it frustrating seeing Winston so slow to pick up on his situation on the other hand it creates an interesting dynamic between Smith and Winston with Smith using Winston ignorance to his advantage I don think I ever seen a Faustian bargain ending with the devil being beaten at his own game but that exactly what happens here Speaking of Smith this wa Burgess Meredith last Twilight Zone episode and he couldn have gone out on a higher note I don think the episode had problem filling out the hour but it still feel like two half hour script combined into one take an episode about a printer that predicts the future and an episode about a deal with the devil and you have Printer Devil That not really a complaint but it felt worth mentioning Also I loved the visual presentation of this episode especially that shot of Smith reflection in the window 7 The Parallel I wa a huge fan of The Parallel when I first watched it but I not a high on it now a I wa The concept is simple but brillaint and they do an amazing job of showing off the subtle difference between the parallel universe I love how subtle the difference were for the most part it drive home the fact that this universe is close enough to the one Robert call home but this isn where he belongs this wouldn have been a impactful if the parallel universe had alien roaming around or something crazy like that The acting is superb especially from Robert and his family and I love how the truth behind Robert situation is lightly hinted at until the President Kennedy revelation at the end of the first half Once it clear that Robert is in a parallel universe the episode expands on this and take the story absolutely nowhere This episode had the making of a masterpiece with shade of Little Girl Lost And When the Sky Was Opened Shadow Play and other tense yet low key episode Instead the second half just repeat information that we already learned in the first half then Robert sort of just end up back in his original dimension I mentioned that Horace Ford suffers the most from it runtime with one exception and The Parallel is that exception the story started losing steam after thirty minute and it clearly did not have the leg to go another twenty It a shame because in a just world with a shorter runtime this could have been an all time classic 6 In His Image In His Image wa the first episode of Season 4 and this wa our introduction to the new runtime I talked a lot about the limitation of the longer runtime but In His Image doe a fine job showcasing the strength of the new format Walter and Alan are the central character in a story that echo Frankenstein and the theme that Beaumont explores are given plenty of time to breath throughout the hour without outstaying their welcome I immediately had flashback to The Chaser once I saw George Grizzard but he doe a stellar job of portraying the creator and his creation Some people have described the episode a an example of queer coding from the day when homosexuality in medium wa taboo I not sure how much I subscribe to that theory but it definitely an interesting take on the concept of creating a flawless version of yourself Overall more episode in Season 4 should have used In His Image a an example for how to make an hour long Twilight Zone episode 5 Valley of the Shadow Peaceful Valley ha been blessed with universe altering technology but they don trust humanity to use it wisely There are so many ethical question brought up in this episode that it leaf you questioning whether anyone involved is fully right or fully wrong Many Charlie Beaumont episode end with an it wa just a dream kind of ending Sometimes it work like in Shadow Play sometimes it feel cheap like in Person or Persons Unknown but in Valley of the Shadow having Redfield wake up back at the gas station wa the perfect way to end this story Redfield doe the right thing by escaping to share their technology with the world but in doing so he proved exactly why humanity wasn ready for this kind of responsibility It a cynical ending but also an appropriate one 4 The New Exhibit Martin Balsam play a museum worker who obsessed with his wax figure not unlike Charlie in Miniature While the doll in Miniature are a reflection of Charlie fragile mind the figure in The New Exhibit have a more active role in the story It up to the viewer to decide whether the figure were haunted or if Martin wa just going completely mad but we can all agree that wax figure can be absolutely terrifying This is the only proper horror episode in Season 4 and part of what make the horror work so well is the tension this is the closest The Twilight Zone ha come to equaling Hitchcock mastery of suspense Charles Beaumont wrote six episode this season just one fewer than Serling did and I confident in calling The New Exhibit the best of the six 3 Death Ship Death Ship is a multi layered episode that show you the final puzzle right up front and spends the rest of the episode assembling the piece At this point I contractually obligated to call Jack Klugman the best Twilight Zone actor and naturally he gave u another 10 10 performance but it easy to forget that he not the ONLY good actor in his episode A Passage for Trumpet had John Anderson A Game of Pool had Jonathan Winters and this episode ha Ross Martin giving u a performance that I argue is even better than Klugman if you read any of my list before you know why this is just about the highest praise I could give an actor Not only wa runtime not an issue here the entire hour wa filled with creative way to tell the story and it made the time fly by Captain Ross interfering in Mason dream wa inspired and I love how the ending wa just an abrupt cut back to the beginning This episode is rich with character development this is yet another Klugman episode where loneliness is an aspect of his character and little moment that I sure I pick up on upon rewatching Of all the Twilight Zone episode that I absolutely adore this and Shadow Play are the only two that I wanted to watch again immediately after finishing 2 He Alive At the risk of sounding political Nazis are bad In all seriousness everyone know that Nazis are bad and everyone know that racism prejudice and hate are bad Are Nazis bad is an easy question to answer but how doe hate spread like it did in Nazi Germany is far more complex and that the question He Alive try time answer Peter is a chicken shit wannabe fuehrer whose hate wa born out of a need to blame a scapegoat for his shitty life and with this character Rod pretty much nailed every Proud Boy every incel every modern day neo Nazi all of them It can feel on the nose at time but this isn an episode that needed to be subtle It doesn shy away from comparing modern day hatred to Hitler rhetoric and moment such a the we are the minority speech very well could have been about 2019 and not 1963 Of course the message of this episode would have fallen flat without the outstanding performance by Dennis Hopper who manages to nail every aspect of Peter character Also Rod closing monologue is among his best and it wa the perfect way to cap off an episode that we still need in 2019 1 On Thursday We Leave for Home In Season 3 it wa a tossup between five or six for what the best episode could have been That not the case with Season 4 because On Thursday We Leave for Home completely dwarf it competition Death Ship and He Alive are both great episode and either one of them could have been in the number two slot but neither of them hold a candle to On Thursday We Leave for Home I don think any episode took u on a journey through one character arc quite like this one I didn think I ever love a performance more than Jack Klugman in A Passage For Trumpet but James Whitmore performance a Captain Benteen wa beyond perfect Captain Benteen might be the most complex character in the series thus far gradually changing from gentile shepherd of his flock to psychotic megalomaniac I wa sold on Benteen being a good person for half the episode and I spent the rest of the episode in a state of pure tension because I wa afraid of what he might do and dammit I wa nearly in tear by the ending which I won spoil here because this is definitely an episode you need to experience for yourself This character ha so many layer and Whitmore played him to perfection in every scene The fact that I wa sold hook line and sinker on this character is also a testament to Serling writing and this really is one of his best script ever Serling unique brand of humanism u present in every single line especially in his monologue where he wax poetic about Earth being a complicated yet wonderful mess Speaking of Serling he really seemed to struggle with the hour long format but leave it to him to write the best hour long episode because he Rod Goddamn Serling I don think I exaggerating when I call Season 4 the worst season of the show but On Thursday We Leave for Home isn number one just because it the best of a bad lot Do yourself a favor and watch this episode maybe watch the rest of the top six then throw the rest of Season 4 in the garbage,Every Episode of The Twilight Zone Ranked Season Four,Hooooooooo boy Season Four is the most infamous one of the series thanks to the controversial decision to have hour long episode Some people think that The Twilight Zone wasn meant to have anything but half hour episode but I of the mind that hour long episode could have worked if done properly A longer runtime provides more opportunity to expand upon a concept or spend more time on character development So did Season Four take advantage of the runtime to create compelling television For the most part no I gonna come out and say it there only ONE episode of the entire season that needed to be an hour long That not to say there weren other episode that I consider good or even great but when the runtime becomes an issue for nearly every episode there is a serious problem Full disclosure I took a break from writing this because I wa starting to feel burnt out and I realized I wa just repeating myself because I have very little to say about most of these episode I coming back to this after a few week so this isn going to be the most detailed list I done partially because I blanking on some specific part of these episode and partially because I just want to get this over with and move on to Season 5 Anyway on with the show 18 The Bard A lot of the bad Season Four episode are bad in a way that isn even interesting to talk about and there isn a whole lot to say about The Bard besides it suck Burt Reynolds chewing the scenery is the only thing worth enjoying in this piece of shit episode that feel like Rod Serling wa trying to pull a fast one on the network executive and sponsor that meddled with his script I all for a bit of meta commentary but the episode ha to be good for the commentary to land and The Bard is about a far from good a an episode can get Plenty of Twilight Zone episode leave me with unanswered question but all I left with here is why doe William Shakespeare feel the need to quote himself and cite the specific line he referencing like a 10th grade English student I don even want to talk about the absolutely meaningless story if I said a failed writer conjures William Shakespeare to write script for him and made you come up with a story in your head whatever you come up with would probably have more direction than The Bard This episode would have sucked a a half hour affair but being an hour long made it nothing short of insufferable On that note I want to point out that Rod Serling may be the king of half hour television but he seemed to struggle with the hour long format of Season Four and it show in The Bard 17 I Dream of Genie Some episode get criticized for not feeling like a Twilight Zone episode and I never understood that complaint The Twilight Zone ha episode ranging from Eye of the Beholder to Once Upon a Time to A Passage For Trumpet nothing off the table really But with I Dream of Genie I totally get it The Twilight Zone element is minimal at best 90 of it is just a dude daydreaming about what his wish would be I didn actively dislike it Howard Morris is entertaining enough to make the time pas but there nothing in this episode that feel like something out of The Twilight Zone There no social commentary no relationship with the paranormal or supernatural no spectacular writing hell it doesn even have the hacky shoddiness that the bad episode are known for As for the episode we did get it just a series of vignette with nothing worth talking about 16 Passage on the Lady Anne While Passage on the Lady Anne is far from the most well liked Season 4 episode I seem to be in the minority of people who outright despise it Some people like it for it character development it an episode more focused on it character than it concept On some level I can appreciate that and I would definitely call Alan and Elaine well developed character but a huge part of why The Twilight Zone work for me is the concept it explores and how the concept help fuel the character development story message pathos etc The concept of Passage on the Lady Anne is so poorly developed that I don even know how to describe it The idea of the ship having supernatural element is barely explored until the ending when we just told that the Lady Anne died on her way back to her home planet As for the plot it just a bunch of scene that are hardly connected in any meaningful way For example the McKenzies say that Alan and Elaine don have to die before an ad break and when we return it never brought up again We treated to a whole bunch of half assed treatise on love and how the old way are being done away with but it all so unfocused that I couldn get a read on any sort of story they were telling besides Alan and Elaine marriage being in shamble I say it right now Charles Beaumont wrote 6 episode this season and this is far and away his only bad one 15 Of Late I Think of Cliffordville Twilight Zone actor who star in more than one episode are almost always fantastic actor Jack Klugman Burgess Meredith John Anderson etc Albert Salmi is an exception Of all the actor who have appeared in three or more episode he one of the only one I can think of that wa never all that good in any of them He never outright terrible but he never elevates any episode that he in Case in point Of Late I Think of Cliffordville It funny a commercial came on before this episode telling me to think about my eye and maybe I should have taken that to heart because the old age makeup Salmi had to wear wa painful to look at I know the show wa fighting against budget restraint but they were able to pull it off in Long Live Walter Jameson so there no excuse Pretty much every episode with a deal with the devil story ha an idiot for a main character but Feathersmith is a special kind of idiot Part of that ha to do with the character not being written all that well but part of that also ha to do with Albert Salmi not having the charisma to make this character work onscreen Salmi famously hated film TV acting that may have something to do with it Julie Newmar and John Anderson are great but their talent are wasted because they play second banana to Salmi who never should have been in this role in the first place With a different lead actor I may have liked it more but I doubt it 14 No Time Like the Past What could have been a decent half hour episode wa turned into a pointless hour of television Paul Driscoll can change the past This is a lesson that wa learned in the first twenty minute when he couldn evacuate Hiroshima like five fucking minute before the bomb drop kill Hitler or change the course of the Lusitania again five minute before it get torpedoed yet somehow this episode managed to last fifty goddamn minute He not unable to change the past because the past is written in stone he unable to change the past because he a fucking moron Those first twenty minute were absolutely irrelevant this episode could have started with Paul going to 1881 to stop Garfield assassination and moved on from there and nothing would have been different That probably wouldn have saved No Time Like the Past the acting wa pretty lackluster throughout especially from Abby and the writing isn all that inspired outside of some FANTASTIC dialogue during the dinner scene The dinner scene is the only scene I actually enjoyed it wa the only moment in the entire episode where Serling showed u why he one of the best writer in the history of television It a scene so good that it genuinely baffling how much the rest of the episode suck 13 The Incredible World of Horace Ford The Incredible World of Horace Ford shouldn have been an hour long episode I enjoyed about 10 15 minute worth of material which would have been thin even for a half hour episode but with a runtime of over an hour it damn near interminable This episode wa full of filler so many theme and scene were repeated nearly verbatim and it just got old I also really didn like his mother it would have been cool if she wa similar to the mother in Young Man Fancy but she given no character so she add nothing to the story That not to say nothing worked in this episode I love the idea of Horace Ford a a character but he the type of character who work best in small dos so following him for an hour got pretty grating I also thought the story they told wa pretty good it ha shade of Walking Distance and the aforementioned Young Man Fancy but the execution really suffers due to the runtime With one exception no other Season 4 episode suffers more from it runtime the part I did enjoy were dragged on too long and the rest of the episode is pure filler 12 Mute The premise of a little girl losing the only people that she could communicate with is one worth exploring and if Mute stuck to that it would have been fantastic The part of the episode that do line up with that premise are the best part like the time when she read people mind and especially the moment when she reflects on how she learned about boat without word More of that would have been nice but the story end up being a bit of a mess Not a complete mess but there wa too much drama for it own good Cora burning the letter wa dumb and selfish and I don like how that decision doesn bite her in the as at all in the end I totally get her motivation but this aspect of the episode wa really unnecessary Mommy issue wa a really weird recurring theme this season and I don understand why because it wa never good This is an episode that really didn need to be an hour long even immediately after watching it I didn have a whole lot to say about it 11 Jess Belle I can believe I saying this but I really liked Jess Belle Yes I enjoyed one of the episode that almost universally considered bottom ten material Were there problem though Absolutely Earl Hamner wrote

You just have to read and find ou oh who am I kidding Print is dead Television is dead Long live bingeflix Twilight Zone ha been brought to you by Willie Windows too fragile Over my dead body amp x200B After the first couple of minute this episode come off a your paint by number comedy you got some light banter from a couple of grump and the eccentric TV repairman that seems to delight in Joe trash talking a little too much For what little screentime Holloway get he easily the funniest part of the episode Normally you expect the devil character to be a charismatic fast talker like Genie from The Man in the Bottle but the way he delivers it with this breathy southern drawl with the lightest hint of knowing it perfect That look he give into the camera a he close the door and that zinger at the end are highlight that make you wish Phyllis had called him back for some more screentime Didn expect Winnie the Pooh to be hauntin machine and murderin couple but I guess we going with the comic canon And y know there really is some nice early dialogue When Phyllis is ranting off her suspicion and tell Joe don jump out a window the irony meter is broken Plus she make a comment about Cleopatra which is real amusing considering Queen of the Nile wa aired right before this one Things start going south when the TV turn on Joe reacts very seriously to tonight episode of the Twilight Zone to the point of fainting Phyllis is out there riffing about ugly carpet but Joe shook The episode want you to start empathizing with Joe when he been built up a a grouchy slob who casually insult TV repairman I mean if Pooh weren a devil he be well within his right to leave Joe with his battered down boob tube And even after he regains consciousness he immediately accuses Phyllis of plotting a long con with Pooh in cahoot a if she ha camera planted everywhere or something It hard for me to feel bad for this guy who been nothing but cartoonishly antagonistic Am I saying that Joe should be reacting to this in a cartoonish way Well maybe Wouldn it be funny to jump over the usual hurdle of the character being wide eyed and sweaty and have him immediately go on a tirade on Phyllis or angrily try to call up the repairman Why he even tell Phyllis to do it Eh maybe I just groaning for the sake of it Even if this character meant to be a comedic caricature it not terrible for him to act semi realistically it even add depth I just hope there isn some big emotional climax centered around Joe and Phyllis character like they haven been exaggerated curmudgeon this whole time That would be real bad This episode shown it hand the TV guide say Joe gonna kill Phyllis Will the journey be interesting What Joe gonna do to prevent this He give a monologue about how being a cabby is tough and how people are constantly yelling at him and treating him badly No Bad 17 minute in is not the time to start making your protagonist sympathetic especially with how obnoxious he been thus far As much crap a I given this episode it really break my heart because it could been good This wouldn be a bad moment if you toned down the grouchiness and started giving him hint of depth earlier on And a much a I hate to say this if you wanted this to be a dramatic episode then you should cut the TV repairman out Later it revealed that Phyllis only see static on Channel 10 which put forth the idea that Joe may be having a mental breakdown fueled by guilt But uh no he not It because the spooky TV repairman put a hex on the TV which only he can see somehow The presence of Pooh actually strip away nuance and cheapens the drama And the worst part is I get what they wanted to do here Joe is a sad old man with a grueling job so he drowns his sorrow in booze and TV He seen enough sitcom to believe that a heartfelt speech will win the girl heart and fix everything But surprise surprise Phyllis doesn like being cheated on And then the episode make another blunder by having Phyllis act unrealistically cruel during this big dramatic moment Should Phyllis be mad that Joe been cheatin Yes Is she in the right to break up with him Absolutely By the end of it she vindictively turn the TV on to torment a mentally unstable person Before she wa surprisingly nice to him when she thought he wa sick but now that he exposed a a cheater she just gonna straight up torture him He punch a hole through the TV and she just stand there cackling What a complete 180 Is this supposed to be a realistic person How am I supposed to take this seriously And even after all that there would still be something viscerally poignant about someone tormenting a mentally ill person blind to their pain that is of course if Pooh didn come back to remind u that it wa just a magic trick all along What a waste amp x200B You know what really neat about this episode It sprinkle in some commentary that watching violent television can lead to aggressive behavior which is pretty darn prescient for the 60 Through the episode the only real show Joe watch is wrestling You notice that during that violent struggle in the end Joe doe a chair shot at Phyllis implying that this wa a result of watching so much wrestling Phyllis even call him a TV addict It would be real great if we could attribute his violent action to anything other than Pooh magic power Once you write in a devil that curse TVs and grin into the camera thing become inherently goofier That silly old bear destroying my character depth And why did Pooh murder Joe and his wife Because he insulted TV repairman That wa the straw the broke the camel back Jeez And even in a dedicated comedic episode like A Most Unusual Camera the bad event are always a product of the character greed with a clear progression And even if the way they tumble out of the window is contrived the squabble preceding it is in line with all of their character It also help that Woodward didn give an impassioned speech about how he wa an orphan raised by the street While I doubt this episode is generally beloved I doubt many folk would rant about it this much Nothing get my goat like wasted potential I imagine to your average viewer it a forgettable so so episode and that all well and good And in my holy crusade against television I forgot to mention that this episode isn written by a regular but one Martin Goldsmith who also wrote The Encounter another Season 5 funfest starring George Takei Meh maybe by the time I get around to that I have seen Detour and have something more substantive to say about his work in general Now if you excuse me I

142,OneTrueBrody,1,After watching Season Two and only really loving a handful of episode I wa worried that the show peaked too soon I glad I wa wrong because Season Three of The Twilight Zone is one of the best season of television in the history of the medium That not because every episode wa great though there are very few episode that I actually call bad It also not the best season because it had a lot of episode that I call 10 10 perfect though that is also true This season is perfect because nearly every episode left me saying wow something about what I just watched make me love this show even more Whether an episode wa excellent or mediocre straightforward or weird complex or simple I wa always entertained At a certain point isn that all you need This wa a really hard list to make because so many episode from this season are somebody favorite I didn just rank these based on my subjective feeling I don want to be that guy who say one episode is the best just because it my favorite but everyone taste is different You may think that my least favorite episode should have been number one and you may think that my favorite episode doesn even belong in the top thirty If you think I wa unfair to one episode and ranked another one way too high let me know because the whole point of this list is to get other people opinion Ok enough of that on with the show 37 Four O Clock The worst episode of this season is also the only episode that I consider absolutely pointless A man want to punish the world evil doer by making them two foot tall but it turn out that he the one who get shrunk at the end That it that the whole episode Do you want to watch that for 25 minute I wa able to predict the ending just by reading the episode preview on IMDB That not a bad thing in and of itself the number one episode on this list ha a fairly predictable twist but make up for it by making the rest of the episode a complete masterpiece but nothing about Four O Clock is worth watching I want to punish the world No don you crazy Rinse repeat 36 A Quality of Mercy I understand that this show is a product of it time so I can look past the occasional non PC moment a long a it doesn interfere with the rest of the episode Will Shatner saying he being treated like a retarded child in Nick of Time is my go to example for dated line that can be easily ignored I can get over the yellowface in A Quality of Mercy though I get that yellowface wa an industry standard at the time but having the lead character learn about respecting the enemy doesn work when the actor is in goddamn yellowface Imagine having an episode about racism where the main character is played by a white dude in blackface it actively conflict with the message The ending is also one of the weakest ending in the series Predictable but inevitable is a phrase that describes an ending that wa easy to see coming but wa also the perfect way to end the story The inevitable ending wa for Katell to make the decision not to attack the enemy but what we got instead wa the war ending before Katell could make the call What should have been the natural conclusion to his character arc just leaf me feeling hollow 35 The Gift The Gift might a well be retitled Womp Womp because that the only thing that come to mind whenever I think about the ending Fear of the unknown is a subject that this show usually excels at but the Christ like imagery used for the mysterious stranger wa way too obvious to be compelling The Gift wa also weirdly melodramatic especially with the orphaned child For some reason I compared this episode to Dust because of the melodramatic atmosphere but Dust also ha emotional weight to it scene that just about justifies the melodrama That not the case with The Gift Instead we get an ending where the stranger wa about to cure every disease known to man but wa killed Cue the Price is Right horn next episode 34 The Mirror Magic object episode are rarely good but a story about a dictator being consumed by paranoia could have been excellent The writing wa nothing special and the set design didn immerse me in the world of the episode What really brings The Mirror down is the performance which were incredibly dull There five character and I couldn tell you a single thing about any of them these actor didn make the character pop off the screen at all Overall The Mirror is just dull It feel like everyone involved just phoned it in and that almost never the case with this show 33 Dead Man Shoes If I wa giving episode letter grade the last four would receive Fs Dead Man Shoes would receive a D a passing grade but desperately needing improvement As much a I love the noir aesthetic it worked a lot better in episode like The Four of Us Are Dying The Four of Us Are Dying is actually a great point of comparison because that episode also dealt with identity While that episode explored the concept through a variety of lens this episode ha way too much filler It take nearly 20 minute for the hobo to talk to the mob bos and that easily could have been edited down to ten minute cut the scene with the hobo friend and shorten the apartment scene I still think this episode isn a total failure and that because of the ending The final scene is super intriguing and contextualizes everything that Nathan went through Unfortunately he dy before anything interesting can be done with that revelation and the ambiguous final shot of the other hobo putting on the shoe feel like a tease This episode would have been interesting if we saw a series of hobo putting on the shoe so the titular dead man could seek his revenge I don know if that a good idea for an episode but anything would be more intriguing than the episode we got 32 The Jungle Does The Jungle suck Yes Is it the worst episode of the show like so many people say it is No The episode go way overboard with talking about superstition like I get it this guy think they dumb can we move on Speaking of the main character I hesitant to even call him a character I forgot his name halfway through which make sense because he le of a person and more of a device to move u from scene to scene I don know if the ending wa supposed to be scary or not but it so laughably stupid that I can take it seriously If the episode were intentionally comedic that be fine but the rest of the episode is somewhat serious so the tonal shift at the end is jarring Having said all that the second act is unironically fantastic The tension is palpable a our main character walk home to the ambient sound of the continent he thought he left behind That scene save this otherwise very stupid episode 31 The Little People Remember how I thought most of the episode in Season Two had interesting premise but lame execution That The Little People It a good thing that I take note because I genuinely forgot about this episode it easily the most forgettable of the season This episode tried to invoke The Invaders but The Invaders is an iconic episode because of it creative format rather than it plot The Little People isn creative in it story or it presentation Craig say in the beginning that his goal in life is to be a ruler of the mass and the second he discovers the little people he turn into a megalomaniacal douche This episode could have ended with the little people overthrowing Craig cementing the fact that he not a god but nope he just get killed by giant because irony This experiment in space psychology is undone by Craig over the top performance he too ridiculous to be compelling 30 Person or Persons Unknown This episode sure doe exist The premise is self explanatory a guy wake up and nobody recognizes him What took one sentence for me to describe is broken down and explained for what feel like the entire episode There a long scene in the shrink office where the shrink tell u nothing we wouldn already know from what came before As the conclusion drew nearer I kept thinking don just be a dream don just be a dream don just be a GOD DAMMIT He wake up and people can recognize him but he can recognize anyone else What a twist 29 A Piano in the House IF YOU LEAVE ME I M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY While that is obviously the best line in the history of television this episode is more of a guilty pleasure than something I call good Characters saying what in their mind when they hear a song is the antithesis of show don tell The acting is really weird too The actor are awkwardly stiff whenever they aren the center of attention which make sense because they trying to accentuate the moment when they cut loose so to speak but it can be distracting Having said all that the moment when the character DO cut loose are the best kind of campy That doesn make this episode good but I wa thoroughly entertained 28 The Grave I gonna do something a bit different and talk about the man who wrote The Grave before talking about the episode itself Montgomery Pittman wrote three episode in Season Three before dying in 1962 Like any writer he had his strength and weakness While he wa a master of world building and character development his biggest weakness in my opinion wa writing compelling dialogue spoiler for my top ten I guess That lead me to The Grave my least favorite of his episode The Grave barely ha a plot it just a scary story to tell around a campfire In fact this story is just a Western version of a famous story called The Graveyard Dare It fine enough for a simple horror story but there not enough meat to fill the runtime 2 3 of this episode take place in the bar and the dialogue go on and on and on The episode fade to black to mark the halfway point and when they cut back they STILL in the damn bar That kind of lead me to Pittman other weakness pacing The Grave pacing is absolutely abysmal I all for a slow burn but every scene just drag on to the point where any intriguing element is drowned out by sheer tedium This episode doe have it fan and I guess if I looked past the pacing and the weak dialogue I could appreciate the Western aesthetic and spooky plot Unfortunately I can place this episode above the more well rounded episode from this season 27 The Fugitive In The Fugitive an old man best friend is a young crippled girl Setting aside the stranger danger element this episode doe have some sweet and wholesome moment I can totally believe the friendship between Ben and Jenny it isn weird at all in context especially for 1962 But HOLY FUCK did this episode not age well At one point he cure Jenny of her disability by laying her down on her bed and using a magical device on her making her close her eye a the girl say will it hurt and be careful with her visibly confused aunt right outside the door and if you excuse me I need to take the longest shower in the history of running water It kind of amazing that two men try to kill a little girl and that not the part that aged horribly All joke aside this episode isn ranked low because of how it aged It a fine episode but it get way too sappy at time 26 Cavender is Coming Is this episode funny or ha my brain finally turned to pudding after watching 100 episode In any case I did enjoy this episode quite a bit I didn think I ever see a Twilight Zone episode where two different people throw themselves through window but here we are This episode is a beat for beat remake of Mr Bevis so it get no point for originality but I do enjoy this one a lot more than Mr Bevis For starter Carol Burnett brings Agnes to life with her trademark slapstick charm Also I really liked the decision to put Cavender himself in the spotlight Most guardian angel story only focus on the human so it somewhat unique to put the focus on the actual angel As much a I do enjoy it it still a typical guardian angel story so the plot is about a run of the mill a it get A Passage for Trumpet is exception when it come to these type of story It not groundbreaking but I enjoyed Cavender is Coming more than I had any right to 25 Showdown with Rance McGrew An actor who play a badass on a TV show turn out to be a total pussy once he get beaten up by the character he pretending to be stronger That not a great Twilight Zone premise and it make me wonder what Rod Serling really thought of his actor behind the scene Showdown With Rance McGrew wa written back when Westerns were dominating the box office so it isn the most relevant episode today Imagine if Jordan Peele Twilight Zone skewered a superhero actor like Robert Downey Jr or Hugh Jackman it probably be entertaining a a parody but it definitely be dated in 60 year That being said I did enjoy the episode for what it wa There something about Jesse James taking the piss out of Rance that I found really funny That doesn make it a great episode a concept like this definitely ha a ceiling for how good it can be but I did have a good time watching this 24 Hocus Pocus and Frisby Comedic episode in the first two season almost never worked but for some reason Season Three managed to make light hearted episode that were genuinely enjoyable Submitted for your approval Hocus Pocus and Frisby A bullshit artist named Frisby ha to survive a real life version of one of his tall tale Plenty of Twilight Zone episode were centered around liar and jackass but Frisby is a different kind of liar He not an asshole he just full of tall tale He lie like your grandfather did when he told you the story about how he saved the kid who got lost in the ball pit at the McDonald playpen ok I may be projecting here Point is I kind of love how full of shit he is and I also love how his friend know how full of shit he is but play along anyway Aliens abduct him because they don understand the concept of lie on their home planet classic comedic misunderstanding This episode get a lot of flak for it plot yeah those people are right I do enjoy this episode for what it is but nothing about it story make it a definitive Twilight Zone episode But those creepy alien face now THAT is what this show is all about So is it a great Twilight Zone episode Not really but I enjoy it anyway There a place for light hearted episode that don really raise the bar for quality but are still enjoyable experience 23 The Arrival Rod Serling opening monologue for The Arrival tell u that we get 90 of the puzzle piece and the other 10 is up to u It a check that the rest of the episode can cash After the plane and everyone else in the hangar disappears the investigator get told that oh there wa no plane you thinking of a different investigation What a lame way to end an otherwise captivating mystery All thing considered I do enjoy this episode more than most people The mystery of the missing passenger is mind bending and that scene in the hangar had me on the edge of my seat If this episode were in Season Two I might have put it at in the top 15 because there is a lot to enjoy The ending just didn deliver and that really hurt this episode 22 Still Valley Elegy wa a really bad episode so when I saw that Still Valley wa going to use the frozen in time concept I wa worried In the end I wa pleasantly surprised by how well they incorporated the frozen people into the episode Instead of spending way too much time staring at still people like in Elegy Still Valley only show u the frozen army for a couple of minute before moving on It a good thing they did that because the effect isn that much better than it wa in Elegy but it doesn dominate the episode to a point where I can help but notice every blink or twitch My biggest problem with Elegy wasn the shitty effect it wa the fact that the episode had no stake and no reason to care for anyone or anything in the episode Still Valley fix that by giving the soldier the power to freeze the Union and leaving the decision to use that power up to them In the end they don decide to use that power because that wouldn make them any better than the Damn Yankees It a simple a a story can get but that not a bad thing in and of itself a long a the episode ha a point I may be giving this episode too much credit because it a much better version of an episode I hate but Still Valley is good in it own right 21 The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank A title from our friend Mr Montgomery Pittman who wrote and directed this episode The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank is a better display of Pittman strength a a writer especially when it come to world building Pittman isn content to just have actor put on a southern accent and call it a day he went out of his way to make the audience feel like they were in 1920 America That ha just a much to do with his direction a it doe his writing so I give him credit on both front He created the perfect setting to tell this story which is compelling enough The mysterious stranger gimmick didn work in The Gift but this episode took note from The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street and tapped into the town fear of the unknown Having said that the dialogue is once again the weakest link of Pittman episode Most of the dialogue boil down to something up with Jeff and after a while I kept thinking yes we get it can we move on Too much of this episode is dedicated to reminding u that Jeff is acting weird without actually showing u how Jeff is acting or giving u a reason why we should care if he a demon or not Credit where it due while I don think these character were well written the performance by the actor were excellent enough to draw my attention This episode ha a lot to appreciate but it also ha me wanting more Part of me think the premise wa too ambitious to tell in 25 minute and it a damn shame that Pittman didn get the chance to turn this into a movie or something along those line Also what the hell wa that closing monologue 20 One More Pallbearer One More Pallbearer is a revenge plot gone awry Radin try to extort the people who he belief have wronged him only to learn that they wouldn give him the time of day if he wa the last motherfucker on Earth Radin is the best kind of asshole he confident enough to believe his own bullshit He so petty that it satisfying to see his master plan fall through he one of the few protagonist who I actively want to see fail but that also what make the episode fun to watch The ending get a little too weird I don think it needed to end with Radin having a psychotic breakdown but I still recommend this one 19 Young Man Fancy It take a real boy to know a real stocking I be referencing line for the rest of my life alongside IF YOU LEAVE ME I M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY The actual episode start off slow I understand the decision to make Virginia the central character it through her perspective that we see Alex change from a man who can get over his mother to a literal child Having said that I wanted to spend more time with Alex Walking Distance wa a great episode because we got to understand Martin Sloan and get inside his brain and I don think we got enough of that with Alex I did predict that this Alex would become a child at the end but I always said that a predictable ending is fine a long a it executed well and I be damned if the end of Young Man Fancy isn one of the slickest scene in the show The house gradually turning back the clock and looking exactly how it did 25 year ago wa outstanding 18 I Sing the Body Electric Ray Bradbury wrote the 100th episode of The Twilight Zone meaning I officially reviewed 100 of these what the fuck am I doing with my life Anyway I Sing the Body Electric kind of ha a Disney vibe to it and that not just because of the Mary Poppins elephant in the room this episode predates the movie by a few year but I digress I loved the factory scene it felt like Willy Wonka meet Frankenstein That where the episode peak the rest of it is charming a hell but predictable I do want to give the episode credit for writing child character who serve a more than just prop to move the episode along Anne especially had a good deal of depth to her having to balance the loss of her mother with her feeling towards Grandma This episode is a bit on the sappy side but it get a lot more hate than it deserves 17 Five Characters in Search of an Exit I wa really excited to watch Five Characters in Search of an Exit I love show and movie with a quirky premise so this episode seemed right up my alley After watching the episode I feel underwhelmed Don get me wrong it a good episode but I wouldn call it one of the show best Putting purposeful restriction on an episode can lead to creative writing The Invaders did this by not having any dialogue and this episode placed five character in a gray cylinder for the same reason My problem with this episode is that it spends so much time building towards it twist that everything else that isn related to the twist is underdeveloped As for the twist itself I wa underwhelmed Some episode are worth watching even knowing what the twist is but this is one of those episode where knowing the twist completely ruin the episode so I won spoil it here What I will say is that the twist doesn really enhance the rest of the episode like in Eye of the Beholder or To Serve Man This episode doe have excellent character engaging performance and clever writing so on those merit alone I can see why it a fan favorite I just don know why it considered one of the definitive Twilight Zone episode 16 The Passersby What is it with The Twilight Zone and The Confederacy I don have a problem with it because the two Civil War themed episode we got are good but it weird seeing the Confederacy not be the villain in 2019 I know this show wa written in the 1960 but you get my point In any case that doesn take anything away from The Passersby I wa able to figure out what the road symbolized pretty early on the episode doesn exactly try to hide it This episode ha an outstanding set with a score that set the mood perfectly The scene with the soldier who lost part of his face is one of my favorite of the entire series the visual of the light revealing his face is perfectly The writing and acting are excellent Lavinia is a very underappreciated character in my personal opinion This is a haunting episode about death and loss set during America bloodiest conflict and I don care what anyone say but Abraham Lincoln appearance at the end isn even slightly cheesy 15 Once Upon a Time I can see why people are divided on Once Upon a Time It another comedy episode that can feel out of place in The Twilight Zone especially if you not a fan of slapstick What make this episode stand out is the decision to present the 1890 segment a if it were a silent film I love this show because it can take me back to the 1960 but this episode managed to take me back even further in time Even if you not a fan of silent era comedy you have to give it up for Buster Keaton The man paid tribute to the genre he pioneered and he wasn even wearing pant for half the episode The story doesn really matter it only serf to get u from one gag to another That wasn a problem for me because I thought this episode wa hilarious but if you the humor doesn work for you I can see why that would be an issue 14 The Hunt The Hunt is an episode about a dog and for that alone it could have been Number One In all seriousness I couldn help but fall in love with Rip and the amazingly named Hyder Simpson They have one of the most genuine connection between any two character on this show which is impressive because one of them is a freakin dog Hyder isn a complex character but his conviction are true wherever he go Rip go It that decision that save him from his own personal hell and he rewarded with eternal bliss Heaven is a never ending coon hunt with your best buddy something about that make me smile every time 13 Little Girl Lost That final scene my God I knew that somebody wa going into the fourth dimension at some point but holy shit I did not expect that sequence to be so trippy It the best kind of disorientating you supposed to feel just a lost a Tina Hell the CAMERA turn upside down Obviously technology ha improved since 1962 but honestly that sequence still accomplished more than some modern movie that try to take u into an alternate dimension Ant Man and The Wasp for example I think I gushed enough about that one scene let talk about the rest of the episode Is it just me or wa the father acting not all that great He wasn expressive enough in my opinion Also the writing get a bit too technical at time at a certain point I like we get it this is an episode about science Those are just nitpicks though I love the episode for it brilliantly creative ending 12 A Game of Pool Jack Klugman is still the best actor in the entire series and he at the top of his game in A Game of Pool This is probably the coolest Twilight Zone episode I can see this being a personal favorite of someone like The Fonz or James Dean if you catch my drift There something inherently fascinating about listening to two expert talk about their craft whether it in an interview podcast or anything else A Game of Pool isn an episode about billiards it an episode about what it mean to be the best at what you do even if it something a inherently meaningless a pool Jack Klugman a Jesse Cardiff may steal the show but Jonathan Winters a Fats Brown keep up with him every step of the way The combination of slick dialogue and outstanding acting is enough to make A Game of Pool a must watch for any fan 11 Nothing in the Dark I be honest with you I didn like Nothing in the Dark when I first watched it I constantly updating these list a I go but to give you an idea of how much my opinion ha changed about this episode I originally had it at NUMBER THIRTY ONE I did have my reason for not liking it might a well get those out of the way now No disrespect to Robert Redford but I don think this role wa right for him He didn really disappear into the role until the final scene and believe me I getting there The issue might be with the character and not the actor because this version of Mr Death doesn hold a candle to Murray Hamilton portrayal in One for the Angels I also get mixed signal at time The message seems to be don hide from life because you afraid of dying because death is inevitable anyway but the ending still ha Wanda dying after wasting God know how many year of her life It a touching ending but knowing that she wasted her golden year still bum me out It sad but not cathartic to me With that first impression I wa ready to dismiss Nothing in the Dark and move on with my life Then I decided to look up review of this episode and I didn know that some people consider this one of the best episode of the series if not the best overall So I went ahead and watched it again which wa when I realized that this episode wa loaded with symbolism I not joking when I say that every element of this episode is connected to the theme of death and fear The dilapidated apartment the contractor scene the fact that all of her neighbor have moved away shit even the bar on her bed symbolize her self imprisonment Some of this symbolism wa obvious at first but I didn appreciate it fully until my second viewing Also that final scene Robert Redford may not have been great for the episode a a whole but oh my God did he absolutely nail that ending Any problem I had with this episode vanished with this touching and dare I say beautiful ending I don know if I ever truly love this episode like so many of you do but I really glad that I gave this the rewatch it deserved,Ranking Every Twilight Zone Episode Season Three,After watching Season Two and only really loving a handful of episode I wa worried that the show peaked too soon I glad I wa wrong because Season Three of The Twilight Zone is one of the best season of television in the history of the medium That not because every episode wa great though there are very few episode that I actually call bad It also not the best season because it had a lot of episode that I call 10 10 perfect though that is also true This season is perfect because nearly every episode left me saying wow something about what I just watched make me love this show even more Whether an episode wa excellent or mediocre straightforward or weird complex or simple I wa always entertained At a certain point isn that all you need This wa a really hard list to make because so many episode from this season are somebody favorite I didn just rank these based on my subjective feeling I don want to be that guy who say one episode is the best just because it my favorite but everyone taste is different You may think that my least favorite episode should have been number one and you may think that my favorite episode doesn even belong in the top thirty If you think I wa unfair to one episode and ranked another one way too high let me know because the whole point of this list is to get other people opinion Ok enough of that on with the show 37 Four O Clock The worst episode of this season is also the only episode that I consider absolutely pointless A man want to punish the world evil doer by making them two foot tall but it turn out that he the one who get shrunk at the end That it that the whole episode Do you want to watch that for 25 minute I wa able to predict the ending just by reading the episode preview on IMDB That not a bad thing in and of itself the number one episode on this list ha a fairly predictable twist but make up for it by making the rest of the episode a complete masterpiece but nothing about Four O Clock is worth watching I want to punish the world No don you crazy Rinse repeat 36 A Quality of Mercy I understand that this show is a product of it time so I can look past the occasional non PC moment a long a it doesn interfere with the rest of the episode Will Shatner saying he being treated like a retarded child in Nick of Time is my go to example for dated line that can be easily ignored I can get over the yellowface in A Quality of Mercy though I get that yellowface wa an industry standard at the time but having the lead character learn about respecting the enemy doesn work when the actor is in goddamn yellowface Imagine having an episode about racism where the main character is played by a white dude in blackface it actively conflict with the message The ending is also one of the weakest ending in the series Predictable but inevitable is a phrase that describes an ending that wa easy to see coming but wa also the perfect way to end the story The inevitable ending wa for Katell to make the decision not to attack the enemy but what we got instead wa the war ending before Katell could make the call What should have been the natural conclusion to his character arc just leaf me feeling hollow 35 The Gift The Gift might a well be retitled Womp Womp because that the only thing that come to mind whenever I think about the ending Fear of the unknown is a subject that this show usually excels at but the Christ like imagery used for the mysterious stranger wa way too obvious to be compelling The Gift wa also weirdly melodramatic especially with the orphaned child For some reason I compared this episode to Dust because of the melodramatic atmosphere but Dust also ha emotional weight to it scene that just about justifies the melodrama That not the case with The Gift Instead we get an ending where the stranger wa about to cure every disease known to man but wa killed Cue the Price is Right horn next episode 34 The Mirror Magic object episode are rarely good but a story about a dictator being consumed by paranoia could have been excellent The writing wa nothing special and the set design didn immerse me in the world of the episode What really brings The Mirror down is the performance which were incredibly dull There five character and I couldn tell you a single thing about any of them these actor didn make the character pop off the screen at all Overall The Mirror is just dull It feel like everyone involved just phoned it in and that almost never the case with this show 33 Dead Man Shoes If I wa giving episode letter grade the last four would receive Fs Dead Man Shoes would receive a D a passing grade but desperately needing improvement As much a I love the noir aesthetic it worked a lot better in episode like The Four of Us Are Dying The Four of Us Are Dying is actually a great point of comparison because that episode also dealt with identity While that episode explored the concept through a variety of lens this episode ha way too much filler It take nearly 20 minute for the hobo to talk to the mob bos and that easily could have been edited down to ten minute cut the scene with the hobo friend and shorten the apartment scene I still think this episode isn a total failure and that because of the ending The final scene is super intriguing and contextualizes everything that Nathan went through Unfortunately he dy before anything interesting can be done with that revelation and the ambiguous final shot of the other hobo putting on the shoe feel like a tease This episode would have been interesting if we saw a series of hobo putting on the shoe so the titular dead man could seek his revenge I don know if that a good idea for an episode but anything would be more intriguing than the episode we got 32 The Jungle Does The Jungle suck Yes Is it the worst episode of the show like so many people say it is No The episode go way overboard with talking about superstition like I get it this guy think they dumb can we move on Speaking of the main character I hesitant to even call him a character I forgot his name halfway through which make sense because he le of a person and more of a device to move u from scene to scene I don know if the ending wa supposed to be scary or not but it so laughably stupid that I can take it seriously If the episode were intentionally comedic that be fine but the rest of the episode is somewhat serious so the tonal shift at the end is jarring Having said all that the second act is unironically fantastic The tension is palpable a our main character walk home to the ambient sound of the continent he thought he left behind That scene save this otherwise very stupid episode 31 The Little People Remember how I thought most of the episode in Season Two had interesting premise but lame execution That The Little People It a good thing that I take note because I genuinely forgot about this episode it easily the most forgettable of the season This episode tried to invoke The Invaders but The Invaders is an iconic episode because of it creative format rather than it plot The Little People isn creative in it story or it presentation Craig say in the beginning that his goal in life is to be a ruler of the mass and the second he discovers the little people he turn into a megalomaniacal douche This episode could have ended with the little people overthrowing Craig cementing the fact that he not a god but nope he just get killed by giant because irony This experiment in space psychology is undone by Craig over the top performance he too ridiculous to be compelling 30 Person or Persons Unknown This episode sure doe exist The premise is self explanatory a guy wake up and nobody recognizes him What took one sentence for me to describe is broken down and explained for what feel like the entire episode There a long scene in the shrink office where the shrink tell u nothing we wouldn already know from what came before As the conclusion drew nearer I kept thinking don just be a dream don just be a dream don just be a GOD DAMMIT He wake up and people can recognize him but he can recognize anyone else What a twist 29 A Piano in the House IF YOU LEAVE ME I M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY While that is obviously the best line in the history of television this episode is more of a guilty pleasure than something I call good Characters saying what in their mind when they hear a song is the antithesis of show don tell The acting is really weird too The actor are awkwardly stiff whenever they aren the center of attention which make sense because they trying to accentuate the moment when they cut loose so to speak but it can be distracting Having said all that the moment when the character DO cut loose are the best kind of campy That doesn make this episode good but I wa thoroughly entertained 28 The Grave I gonna do something a bit different and talk about the man who wrote The Grave before talking about the episode itself Montgomery Pittman wrote three episode in Season Three before dying in 1962 Like any writer he had his strength and weakness While he wa a master of world building and character development his biggest weakness in my opinion wa writing compelling dialogue spoiler for my top ten I guess That lead me to The Grave my least favorite of his episode The Grave barely ha a plot it just a scary story to tell around a campfire In fact this story is just a Western version of a famous story called The Graveyard Dare It fine enough for a simple horror story but there not enough meat to fill the runtime 2 3 of this episode take place in the bar and the dialogue go on and on and on The episode fade to black to mark the halfway point and when they cut back they STILL in the damn bar That kind of lead me to Pittman other weakness pacing The Grave pacing is absolutely abysmal I all for a slow burn but every scene just drag on to the point where any intriguing element is drowned out by sheer tedium This episode doe have it fan and I guess if I looked past the pacing and the weak dialogue I could appreciate the Western aesthetic and spooky plot Unfortunately I can place this episode above the more well rounded episode from this season 27 The Fugitive In The Fugitive an old man best friend is a young crippled girl Setting aside the stranger danger element this episode doe have some sweet and wholesome moment I can totally believe the friendship between Ben and Jenny it isn weird at all in context especially for 1962 But HOLY FUCK did this episode not age well At one point he cure Jenny of her disability by laying her down on her bed and using a magical device on her making her close her eye a the girl say will it hurt and be careful with her visibly confused aunt right outside the door and if you excuse me I need to take the longest shower in the history of running water It kind of amazing that two men try to kill a little girl and that not the part that aged horribly All joke aside this episode isn ranked low because of how it aged It a fine episode but it get way too sappy at time 26 Cavender is Coming Is this episode funny or ha my brain finally turned to pudding after watching 100 episode In any case I did enjoy this episode quite a bit I didn think I ever see a Twilight Zone episode where two different people throw themselves through window but here we are This episode is a beat for beat remake of Mr Bevis so it get no point for originality but I do enjoy this one a lot more than Mr Bevis For starter Carol Burnett brings Agnes to life with her trademark slapstick charm Also I really liked the decision to put Cavender himself in the spotlight Most guardian angel story only focus on the human so it somewhat unique to put the focus on the actual angel As much a I do enjoy it it still a typical guardian angel story so the plot is about a run of the mill a it get A Passage for Trumpet is exception when it come to these type of story It not groundbreaking but I enjoyed Cavender is Coming more than I had any right to 25 Showdown with Rance McGrew An actor who play a badass on a TV show turn out to be a total pussy once he get beaten up by the character he pretending to be stronger That not a great Twilight Zone premise and it make me wonder what Rod Serling really thought of his actor behind the scene Showdown With Rance McGrew wa written back when Westerns were dominating the box office so it isn the most relevant episode today Imagine if Jordan Peele Twilight Zone skewered a superhero actor like Robert Downey Jr or Hugh Jackman it probably be entertaining a a parody but it definitely be dated in 60 year That being said I did enjoy the episode for what it wa There something about Jesse James taking the piss out of Rance that I found really funny That doesn make it a great episode a concept like this definitely ha a ceiling for how good it can be but I did have a good time watching this 24 Hocus Pocus and Frisby Comedic episode in the first two season almost never worked but for some reason Season Three managed to make light hearted episode that were genuinely enjoyable Submitted for your approval Hocus Pocus and Frisby A bullshit artist named Frisby ha to survive a real life version of one of his tall tale Plenty of Twilight Zone episode were centered around liar and jackass but Frisby is a different kind of liar He not an asshole he just full of tall tale He lie like your grandfather did when he told you the story about how he saved the kid who got lost in the ball pit at the McDonald playpen ok I may be projecting here Point is I kind of love how full of shit he is and I also love how his friend know how full of shit he is but play along anyway Aliens abduct him because they don understand the concept of lie on their home planet classic comedic misunderstanding This episode get a lot of flak for it plot yeah those people are right I do enjoy this episode for what it is but nothing about it story make it a definitive Twilight Zone episode But those creepy alien face now THAT is what this show is all about So is it a great Twilight Zone episode Not really but I enjoy it anyway There a place for light hearted episode that don really raise the bar for quality but are still enjoyable experience 23 The Arrival Rod Serling opening monologue for The Arrival tell u that we get 90 of the puzzle piece and the other 10 is up to u It a check that the rest of the episode can cash After the plane and everyone else in the hangar disappears the investigator get told that oh there wa no plane you thinking of a different investigation What a lame way to end an otherwise captivating mystery All thing considered I do enjoy this episode more than most people The mystery of the missing passenger is mind bending and that scene in the hangar had me on the edge of my seat If this episode were in Season Two I might have put it at in the top 15 because there is a lot to enjoy The ending just didn deliver and that really hurt this episode 22 Still Valley Elegy wa a really bad episode so when I saw that Still Valley wa going to use the frozen in time concept I wa worried In the end I wa pleasantly surprised by how well they incorporated the frozen people into the episode Instead of spending way too much time staring at still people like in Elegy Still Valley only show u the frozen army for a couple of minute before moving on It a good thing they did that because the effect isn that much better than it wa in Elegy but it doesn dominate the episode to a point where I can help but notice every blink or twitch My biggest problem with Elegy wasn the shitty effect it wa the fact that the episode had no stake and no reason to care for anyone or anything in the episode Still Valley fix that by giving the soldier the power to freeze the Union and leaving the decision to use that power up to them In the end they don decide to use that power because that wouldn make them any better than the Damn Yankees It a simple a a story can get but that not a bad thing in and of itself a long a the episode ha a point I may be giving this episode too much credit because it a much better version of an episode I hate but Still Valley is good in it own right 21 The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank A title from our friend Mr Montgomery Pittman who wrote and directed this episode The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank is a better display of Pittman strength a a writer especially when it come to world building Pittman isn content to just have actor put on a southern accent and call it a day he went out of his way to make the audience feel like they were in 1920 America That ha just a much to do with his direction a it doe his writing so I give him credit on both front He created the perfect setting to tell this story which is compelling enough The mysterious stranger gimmick didn work in The Gift but this episode took note from The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street and tapped into the town fear of the unknown Having said that the dialogue is once again the weakest link of Pittman episode Most of the dialogue boil down to something up with Jeff and after a while I kept thinking yes we get it can we move on Too much of this episode is dedicated to reminding u that Jeff is acting weird without actually showing u how Jeff is acting or giving u a reason why we should care if he a demon or not Credit where it due while I don think these character were well written the performance by the actor were excellent enough to draw my attention This episode ha a lot to appreciate but it also ha me wanting more Part of me think the premise wa too ambitious to tell in 25 minute and it a damn shame that Pittman didn get the chance to turn this into a movie or something along those line Also what the hell wa that closing monologue 20 One More Pallbearer One More Pallbearer is a revenge plot gone awry Radin try to extort the people who he belief have wronged him only to learn that they wouldn give him the time of day if he wa the last motherfucker on Earth Radin is the best kind of asshole he confident enough to believe his own bullshit He so petty that it satisfying to see his master plan fall through he one of the few protagonist who I actively want to see fail but that also what make the episode fun to watch The ending get a little too weird I don think it needed to end with Radin having a psychotic breakdown but I still recommend this one 19 Young Man Fancy It take a real boy to know a real stocking I be referencing line for the rest of my life alongside IF YOU LEAVE ME I M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY The actual episode start off slow I understand the decision to make Virginia the central character it through her perspective that we see Alex change from a man who can get over his mother to a literal child Having said that I wanted to spend more time with Alex Walking Distance wa a great episode because we got to understand Martin Sloan and get inside his brain and I don think we got enough of that with Alex I did predict that this Alex would become a child at the end but I always said that a predictable ending is fine a long a it executed well and I be damned if the end of Young Man Fancy isn one of the slickest scene in the show The house gradually turning back the clock and looking exactly how it did 25 year ago wa outstanding 18 I Sing the Body Electric Ray Bradbury wrote the 100th episode of The Twilight Zone meaning I officially reviewed 100 of these what the fuck am I doing with my life Anyway I Sing the Body Electric kind of ha a Disney vibe to it and that not just because of the Mary Poppins elephant in the room this episode predates the movie by a few year but I digress I loved the factory scene it felt like Willy Wonka meet Frankenstein That where the episode peak the rest of it is charming a hell but predictable I do want to give the episode credit for writing child character who serve a more than just prop to move the episode along Anne especially had a good deal of depth to her having to balance the loss of her mother with her feeling towards Grandma This episode is a bit on the sappy side but it get a lot more hate than it deserves 17 Five Characters in Search of an Exit I wa really excited to watch Five Characters in Search of an Exit I love show and movie with a quirky premise so this episode seemed right up my alley After watching the episode I feel underwhelmed Don get me wrong it a good episode but I wouldn call it one of the show best Putting purposeful restriction on an episode can lead to creative writing The Invaders did this by not having any dialogue and this episode placed five character in a gray cylinder for the same reason My problem with this episode is that it spends so much time building towards it twist that everything else that isn related to the twist is underdeveloped As for the twist itself I wa underwhelmed Some episode are worth watching even knowing what the twist is but this is one of those episode where knowing the twist completely ruin the episode so I won spoil it here What I will say is that the twist doesn really enhance the rest of the episode like in Eye of the Beholder or To Serve Man This episode doe have excellent character engaging performance and clever writing so on those merit alone I can see why it a fan favorite I just don know why it considered one of the definitive Twilight Zone episode 16 The Passersby What is it with The Twilight Zone and The Confederacy I don have a problem with it because the two Civil War themed episode we got are good but it weird seeing the Confederacy not be the villain in 2019 I know this show wa written in the 1960 but you get my point In any case that doesn take anything away from The Passersby I wa able to figure out what the road symbolized pretty early on the episode doesn exactly try to hide it This episode ha an outstanding set with a score that set the mood perfectly The scene with the soldier who lost part of his face is one of my favorite of the entire series the visual of the light revealing his face is perfectly The writing and acting are excellent Lavinia is a very underappreciated character in my personal opinion This is a haunting episode about death and loss set during America bloodiest conflict and I don care what anyone say but Abraham Lincoln appearance at the end isn even slightly cheesy 15 Once Upon a Time I can see why people are divided on Once Upon a Time It another comedy episode that can feel out of place in The Twilight Zone especially if you not a fan of slapstick What make this episode stand out is the decision to present the 1890 segment a if it were a silent film I love this show because it can take me back to the 1960 but this episode managed to take me back even further in time Even if you not a fan of silent era comedy you have to give it up for Buster Keaton The man paid tribute to the genre he pioneered and he wasn even wearing pant for half the episode The story doesn really matter it only serf to get u from one gag to another That wasn a problem for me because I thought this episode wa hilarious but if you the humor doesn work for you I can see why that would be an issue 14 The Hunt The Hunt is an episode about a dog and for that alone it could have been Number One In all seriousness I couldn help but fall in love with Rip and the amazingly named Hyder Simpson They have one of the most genuine connection between any two character on this show which is impressive because one of them is a freakin dog Hyder isn a complex character but his conviction are true wherever he go Rip go It that decision that save him from his own personal hell and he rewarded with eternal bliss Heaven is a never ending coon hunt with your best buddy something about that make me smile every time 13 Little Girl Lost That final scene my God I knew that somebody wa going into the fourth dimension at some point but holy shit I did not expect that sequence to be so trippy It the best kind of disorientating you supposed to feel just a lost a Tina Hell the CAMERA turn upside down Obviously technology ha improved since 1962 but honestly that sequence still accomplished more than some modern movie that try to take u into an alternate dimension Ant Man and The Wasp for example I think I gushed enough about that one scene let talk about the rest of the episode Is it just me or wa the father acting not all that great He wasn expressive enough in my opinion Also the writing get a bit too technical at time at a certain point I like we get it this is an episode about science Those are just nitpicks though I love the episode for it brilliantly creative ending 12 A Game of Pool Jack Klugman is still the best actor in the entire series and he at the top of his game in A Game of Pool This is probably the coolest Twilight Zone episode I can see this being a personal favorite of someone like The Fonz or James Dean if you catch my drift There something inherently fascinating about listening to two expert talk about their craft whether it in an interview podcast or anything else A Game of Pool isn an episode about billiards it an episode about what it mean to be the best at what you do even if it something a inherently meaningless a pool Jack Klugman a Jesse Cardiff may steal the show but Jonathan Winters a Fats Brown keep up with him every step of the way The combination of slick dialogue and outstanding acting is enough to make A Game of Pool a must watch for any fan 11 Nothing in the Dark I be honest with you I didn like Nothing in the Dark when I first watched it I constantly updating these list a I go but to give you an idea of how much my opinion ha changed about this episode I originally had it at NUMBER THIRTY ONE I did have my reason for not liking it might a well get those out of the way now No disrespect to Robert Redford but I don think this role wa right for him He didn really disappear into the role until the final scene and believe me I getting there The issue might be with the character and not the actor because this version of Mr Death doesn hold a candle to Murray Hamilton portrayal in One for the Angels I also get mixed signal at time The message seems to be don hide from life because you afraid of dying because death is inevitable anyway but the ending still ha Wanda dying after wasting God know how many year of her life It a touching ending but knowing that she wasted her golden year still bum me out It sad but not cathartic to me With that first impression I wa ready to dismiss Nothing in the Dark and move on with my life Then I decided to look up review of this episode and I didn know that some people consider this one of the best episode of the series if not the best overall So I went ahead and watched it again which wa when I realized that this episode wa loaded with symbolism I not joking when I say that every element of this episode is connected to the theme of death and fear The dilapidated apartment the contractor scene the fact that all of her neighbor have moved away shit even the bar on her bed symbolize her self imprisonment Some of this symbolism wa obvious at first but I didn appreciate it fully until my second viewing Also that final scene Robert Redford may not have been great for the episode a a whole but oh my God did he absolutely nail that ending Any problem I had with this episode vanished with this touching and dare I say beautiful ending I don know if I ever truly love this episode like so many of you do but I really glad that I gave this the rewatch it deservedRanking Every Twilight Zone Episode Season Three

195,kagemushablues415,1,Just like everyone here I felt the new series wa a bit too on the nose and it wa constantly sacrificing the dreadful fantasy we enjoy for the social commentary it wa blatantly trying to convey It wa hard to connect with the character because the original series used to be an escape into another dimension whereas the new story felt contrived to keep a certain political message lessoj in focus during each episode Blurryman change this opinion for me a I think it a codex to the riddle of how the fuck could a talent like JP could authorize production of such cheese Heck it even somewhat cheaply us Rod Serling a a plot device in an obvious invitation to watch previous episode The B amp W release is another clue not just a commercial move After some thought I realized the campfire story metaphor after the 4th wall break is JP way of telling u hey I had to do it The creator and starry casting are all eager to tell u how they feel about current issue but there wa no way to do it even in a sci fi setting without drawing parallel to real people and real problem JP knew the cheese hard to be served hot and in your face for example the camera work ha been mainly focused on close ups of reaction shot instead of wide shot This is a clever way to save money on set budget but also glued the viewer on the character humanity instead of presenting a difficult logic scenario for the viewer to question To our frustration the character didn always make smart or totally natural decision despite being emotionally relatable Maybe like me you also feel a bit trolled by JP decision to fall back on social horror instead of oddball sci fi but I have to respect the wit behind such a move Think about it the Twilight Zone is a powerful license that ha huge expectation CBS probably agreed to let JP use this license to lure in viewer expecting more of the same an escape from reality but he just showed u modern day people in a twisted setting that emboldened their emotion yet altered their scope of decision making We are meant to say this is nothing but tripe nothing new to see here However if such dramatic social horror is the norm shouldn we be a little scared Scared of ourselves The Comedian is an obvious example but the captain of the space shuttle hit too close to home for me a someone who worked a a manager before To expect good twisted sci fi we were shortchaged but Blurrymen made it clear that this wa perhaps their intention Black Mirror wa a cult Brit show from Brooker that wa picked up by Netflix before it became widely

210,nulldrone,1,Let them sit in there tootin on their harp or whatever they do for relaxation Me and youse stay together Just like we wa when we wa traveling down below Hyder amp x200B This episode is so quaint That the word of the day It like an Asher Durand painting It refreshing to see this relaxed woodsy atmosphere in a show that normally find itself entrenched in a concrete jungle When I think of natural setting in the Twilight Zone I often go to the dead canyon of space or the blood soaked jungle of the Pacific theater which are great setting but strike markedly different tone from The Hunt Just watching Hyder and Rip crawling through the forest with frog and cricket chirping sends a smile across my face Even if it not your cup of coke I find that one of the Twilight Zone major strength is how it can tell a whole jambalaya of unique and interesting story There certainly plenty of episode similar to The Hunt that you could draw comparison to and we will but it always have it own distinct southern fried flavor Away bound away cross the wide Twilight Zone amp x200B It shouldn be too surprising that this episode quirk come from the mind of one Earl Hamner Jr oldest of 8 who grew up in rural Virginia during the Great Depression Much of Hyder character seems to draw from Earl Hamner Sr who accidentally shot his own hunting dog and spent day searching for him He wasn much of a church man either spending his Sundays drinking fishing and hunting It also worth mentioning that Hamner already had these old man and old woman character in a series of short story that eventually formed the archetype for Grandpa and Grandma Walton in the hit TV show The Waltons This is but another chapter in the Hamner Cinematic Universe I actually thought it wa really cute how Hyder and Rachel referred to each other a old woman and old man but it work to their advantage a their character already feel developed and we just peeking into their life The opening scene doe a great job at giving u a feel for these character and their lifestyle Really love the set design on the cabin The eponymous hunt is over with pretty quickly I get that most people probably don love this setting a much a I do but darn it can we just watch a man having fun with his dog Also with all the hubbub it easy to forget that Hyder dy trying to save Rip He mentioned earlier that Rip saved his life once showing that that feeling is mutual It often tricky to show a relationship between two character when one of them is mute but I think it portrayed beautifully here Enter gag time Boy am I not fond of gag time Most people are probably aware that Hyder and Rip are dead They are bereft of life pushing up daisy their metabolic process now history We had all the telltale sign the bloody moon the sleepy bird and the lingering shot on the bubbling water with that sad musical sting Also the neighbor tell u Hyder take a comically long amount of time to figure this out and this is where the episode really feel padded This wa originally a 12 minute short on The Kate Smith Hour that seems to be lost medium sans one clip http www youtube com watch v 9TCBemCsQw Given this and some of Hamner comment on Hunnicut performance you can tell that his original vision wa a lot goofier I go back and forth on this one because I like the emotional undercurrent of the episode and I think you could balance out the lighter and darker element but the problem is that it doesn commit to either Once we get into Act 3 we basically forget about all the sadness and get into goofy parable territory Given the type of story Hamner trying to tell it would been better to condense the funeral and dedicate more time to the hunt itself or guiding Hyder towards the gate of hell which he sorta just stumble into Preserving the ending in a more serious story would be tricky maybe have Hyder distraught about dying and turning to his dog for consolation while devil gatekeeper prey on this and when he try to separate them Hyder erupts into a fit of rage in this big emotional climax As it stand the episode is just here and there and doesn manage much comedically or emotionally I think it hit the sentimental beat well enough but there isn really much beyond that It really jarring when the pallbearer carry his coffin in front of his grieving wife and Hyder just standing there clamoring Who in that box I get that he in denial but it just drag and drag I getting Nightmare a a Child vibe But at least that episode know what it want to be Heck even in A Passage for Trumpet Joey concludes that he dead in half the time allowing the episode to flow a lot more smoothly Slow pacing can work with purpose but this is like a jar of molasses with fly stuck inside Ick And in the most jarring of twist this episode come out a a religious parable The Twilight Zone ha always had Christian leaning especially in death centric episode I prefer the Nothing in the Dark approach myself but it understandable given how many Christian household make up the Twilight Zone demographic It pretty solid a far a parable go Hyder love and dedication towards Rip result in Rip saving him from Hell There the weird implication that people without dog are just auto damned but I don really see it that way If there one thing the extended gag time doe it show u how much Hyder care for the people around him He allows the grieving neighbor to dig on his property He ha a loving relationship with his wife and even asks if she find her way to Heaven suggesting that it not just about the dog it about being a good decent person who won sell out loved one for the promise of heavenly reward You can see that Earl loved his father and belief he deserves to be in Heaven despite his lack of faith And finally it time to talk about the portrayal of angel and devil in this episode The gate devil ha a Brooklyn accent and come off a disingenuous whereas the angel a down to earth country boy who don need no fancy wing When Hyder sits down on Eternity Road he mus about how Heaven is mostly full of city folk who disapprove of coon hunting And the episode seems to agree with his thesis Honestly I kind of wish they played this straight What if Heaven actually didn allow dog Wouldn that be so much more poignant and powerful It double a commentary on how you have to conform to some degree when you enter certain institution By sticking to his principle Hyder cast off Heaven in a Lilithian fashion And if you want to keep the happy ending you can have Hyder walk along Eternity Road for a while only stumble into more wayward dog owner saying that they make their own heaven I mean there already some debate on whether dog have soul or not I get Hamner is a good Christian boy who wouldn pen something so blasphemous but I dunno I think that be pretty neat Also it weird to me that dog get into Heaven but raccoon are just there to be hunted Kinda bite don it You could wave this whole paragraph by saying this is just Hyder own personal heaven like Rocky personal Hell from A Nice Place to Visit That a good way to make peace amp x200B The Hunt is a strange entry in the Twilight Zone where Hamner voice shine through The lack of spooky car and spooky piano make it clear that this wasn really written to be a Twilight Zone episode Everybody ha their own idea of what a Twilight Zone episode is and this episode certainly break the mold for me It almost like Act 2 wa purposefully designed to make this episode fit in better which would be totally unnecessary Does this episode venture into Christian broadcasting territory Yeah but at the center lie a sense of love and humanitarianism that undoubtedly belongs in the Twilight Zone,The Groan Zone The Hunt,Let them sit in there

his Sundays drinking fishing and hunting It also worth mentioning that Hamner already had these old man and old woman character in a series of short story that eventually formed the archetype for Grandpa and Grandma Walton in the hit TV show The Waltons This is but another chapter in the Hamner Cinematic Universe I actually thought it wa really cute how Hyder and Rachel referred to each other a old woman and old man but it work to their advantage a their character already feel developed and we just peeking into their life The opening scene doe a great job at giving u a feel for these character and their lifestyle Really love the set design on the cabin The eponymous hunt is over with pretty quickly I get that most people probably don love this setting a much a I do but darn it can we just watch a man having fun with his dog Also with all the hubbub it easy to forget that Hyder dy trying to save Rip He mentioned earlier that Rip saved his life once showing that that feeling is mutual It often tricky to show a relationship between two character when one of them is mute but I think it portrayed beautifully here Enter gag time Boy am I not fond of gag time Most people are probably aware that Hyder and Rip are dead They are bereft of life pushing up daisy their metabolic process now history We had all the telltale sign the bloody moon the sleepy bird and the lingering shot on the bubbling water with that sad musical sting Also the neighbor tell u Hyder take a comically long amount of time to figure this out and this is where the episode really feel padded This wa originally a 12 minute short on The Kate Smith Hour that seems to be lost medium sans one clip http www youtube com watch v 9TCBemCsQw Given this and some of Hamner comment on Hunnicut performance you can tell that his original vision wa a lot goofier I go back and forth on this one because I like the emotional undercurrent of the episode and I think you could balance out the lighter and darker element but the problem is that it doesn commit to either Once we get into Act 3 we basically forget about all the sadness and get into goofy parable territory Given the type of story Hamner trying to tell it would been better to condense the funeral and dedicate more time to the hunt itself or guiding Hyder towards the gate of hell which he sorta just stumble into Preserving the ending in a more serious story would be tricky maybe have Hyder distraught about dying and turning to his dog for consolation while devil gatekeeper prey on this and when he try to separate them Hyder erupts into a fit of rage in this big emotional climax As it stand the episode is just here and there and doesn manage much comedically or emotionally I think it hit the sentimental beat well enough but there isn really much beyond that It really jarring when the pallbearer carry his coffin in front of his grieving wife and Hyder just standing there clamoring Who in that box I get that he in denial but it just drag and drag I getting Nightmare a a Child vibe But at least that episode know what it want to be Heck even in A Passage for Trumpet Joey concludes that he dead in half the time allowing the episode to flow a lot more smoothly Slow pacing can work with purpose but this is like a jar of molasses with fly stuck inside Ick And in the most jarring of twist this episode come out a a religious parable The Twilight Zone ha always had Christian leaning especially in death centric episode I prefer the Nothing in the Dark approach myself but it understandable given how many Christian household make up the Twilight Zone demographic It pretty solid a far a parable go Hyder love and dedication towards Rip result in Rip saving him from Hell There the weird implication that people without dog are just auto damned but I don really see it that way If there one thing the extended gag time doe it show u how much Hyder care for the people around him He allows the grieving neighbor to dig on his property He ha a loving relationship with his wife and even asks if she find her way to Heaven suggesting that it not just about the dog it about being a good decent person who won sell out loved one for the promise of heavenly reward You can see that Earl loved his father and belief he deserves to be in Heaven despite his lack of faith And finally it time to talk about the portrayal of angel and devil in this episode The gate devil ha a Brooklyn accent and come off a disingenuous whereas the angel a down to earth country boy who don need no fancy wing When Hyder sits down on Eternity Road he mus about how Heaven is mostly full of city folk who disapprove of coon hunting And the episode seems to agree with his thesis Honestly I kind of wish they played this straight What if Heaven actually didn allow dog Wouldn that be so much more poignant and powerful It double a commentary on how you have to conform to some degree when you enter certain institution By sticking to his principle Hyder cast off Heaven in a Lilithian fashion And if you want to keep the happy ending you can have Hyder walk along Eternity Road for a while only stumble into more wayward dog owner saying that they make their own heaven I mean there already some debate on whether dog have soul or not I get Hamner is a good Christian boy who wouldn pen something so blasphemous but I dunno I think that be pretty neat Also it weird to me that dog get into Heaven but raccoon are just there to be hunted Kinda bite don it You could wave this whole paragraph by saying this is just Hyder own personal heaven like Rocky personal Hell from A Nice Place to Visit That a good way to make peace amp x200B The Hunt is a strange entry in the Twilight Zone where Hamner voice shine through The lack of spooky car and spooky piano make it clear that this wasn really written to be a Twilight Zone episode Everybody ha their own idea of what a Twilight Zone episode is and this episode certainly break the mold for me It almost like Act 2 wa purposefully designed to make this episode fit in better which would be totally unnecessary Does this episode venture into Christian broadcasting territory Yeah but at the center lie a sense of love and humanitarianism that undoubtedly belongs in the Twilight ZoneThe Groan Zone The Hunt

219,OneTrueBrody,1,Have you ever listened to The White Album in it entirety Everyone know classic While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Birthday but the album ha a lot of filler song that are quite frankly shit For every Happiness is a Warm Gun there a Revolution 9 That kind of how I feel about Season 2 There a sharp divide in quality the good episode are great and the bad episode are REALLY bad As I kept watching I couldn figure out why episode were so hit and miss but then I had an epiphany To put it one way the episode at the top of this list went out of their way to capitalize on their premise and create a memorable experience On the other hand you had episode that had interesting setup but couldn stick the landing which can be frustrating knowing what this show is capable of I guess you could say that compared to the first season Season 2 had a lower floor but a much higher ceiling and you find out why in just a moment 29 The Whole Truth This episode end with a joke about Khrushchev being tricked into buying a car that force him to tell the truth and for that it going to hell I sure the ending killed in 1960 but in 2019 it just dated As a whole the episode never go beyond it one note joke but the ending not only make it the worst episode of the season but quite possibly the worst of the series 28 A Thing About Machines A Thing About Machines is somehow more boring than it title A man getting attacked by household appliance shouldn be le interesting than watching your grandfather yell at his flip phone but here we are The only good part of this episode is Rod Serling giving his opening monologue from a TV screen As much a I love Rod he shouldn be the only part of an episode that I can look at and say yeah I did like that 27 The Man in the Bottle This episode ha a tone problem The second wish ha Arthur wish for a million dollar only to have it taxed away which is almost too realistic to be entertaining The third wish turn him into Hitler With his fourth wish everything return to normal and there an oh shuck I guess everything worked out in the end vibe but I sorry can we go back to the part where a man literally became Adolf Hitler That not a twist that a parody of a twist As for the rest of the episode it a story about a genie so it exactly what you expect but I didn expect to see Godwin Law in the Twilight Zone 26 Static Oh boy I finally get to talk about the episode that were shot to tape instead of filmed normally It wa a cost cutting measure that all but ruined the six episode it wa used it and Static is the worst of them all Ever play a game on an old PC where you have to bring the graphic to their lowest setting and even then the framerate still lag That what watching Static is like The story is basically Sixteen Millimeter Shrine but worse which lead me to a tangent a lot of episode this season were nearly identical to one Season 1 and very rarely did they improve on the original There isn nothing to like about Static but the con heavily outweigh any pro here 25 The Mind and the Matter I not saying Rod didn have a sense of humor but he should have stuck to drama What we have here is an episode that try to be fun and light hearted but just isn I do like the twist that most certainly inspired Being John Malkovich but that about it That my problem with Season 2 episode don suck in a unique way that fun to talk about they just suck 24 The Lateness of the Hour Here we have another episode ruined by it experimental filming but that not the only thing going on here I had a really hard time coming up with word to describe how I feel about The Lateness of the Hour but I know I can just say it bad and leave it at that I had to watch this episode twice because I couldn figure out why I should care about Jana The story is really simple but the execution wasn consistent at all Each scene felt like it belonged in a different episode which is weird because there nothing too complex going on here The twist is fine I guess but if I don care about the first 23 minute the last 2 aren going to change much 23 The Trouble With Templeton It Walking Distance but worse There I said all I had to say about this episode Besides the scene where Templeton leaf and all of the ghost stop acting a the light fade which is admittedly really good nothing stand out Nothing else blew me away but nothing particularly sucked either It a neutral a an episode of The Twilight Zone can get 22 The Silence In my first list I said that Mirror Image wa an episode that I didn understand why people liked and Season 2 equivalent is The Silence The premise is honestly really good a man ha to stay silent for a year and the twist ending could have been shockingly effective There really only one flaw with this episode but it a flaw that ruin everything it doesn feel like he stayed silent for a whole year We spend very little time with Tennyson when he alone in his room and the timeline jump ahead month at a time He could have been in there for a week for all we know and that bad news for an episode that need to sell u on his suffering Of all the episode so far this one had the most potential to be good maybe a longer running time would have helped 21 Back There The first half of Back There is really good I love how the philosophy behind the episode is laid out in what is essentially a group of guy shooting the shit over a game of card John Wilkes Booth a a cartoony OTT villain is surprisingly entertaining Peter on the other hand doesn really have a character He about a average a a protagonist can get and I couldn get invested in him As strong a the episode started it just sort of fizzled out in the end What we have here is an episode with a lot of good quality that isn better than the sum of it part There outstanding concept going on but the execution doesn do any of them justice 20 Dust Dust in an episode with a lot of good element The final third in particular wa really well done from the father hopelessly throwing dust at his son to one of Rod Serling best closing monologue I only have one major flaw with the episode but like The Silence it a critical flaw The main character is a convicted child murderer who basically walked away with no punishment The theme of forgiveness is a powerful one but it would have worked so much better if Luis wa wrongly convicted or at least guilty of a much le heinous crime I know that the point of this episode wa to challenge our conception of punishment and I didn exactly want Luis to hang but he not a character where I can say yeah he deserves to walk away with no sentence If you can get past that then you enjoy Dust a lot more than I did 19 The Odyssey of Flight 33 I wanted this to be a lot better than it wa but Flight 33 come nowhere close to reaching it potential It an episode so wrapped up in asking why is this happening without giving u a reason to care And When the Sky Was Opened wa an episode where you didn know why the astronaut were disappearing but the concept and character were so intriguing that you can help but be engaged Flight 33 focused more on having realistic pilot lingo than making the pilot interesting There wa one scene with two of the passenger talking and I think more scene like that would have made me invested in their plight I have no reason to care that the plane is gonna Quantum Leap for all eternity which suck because that concept could have made for a much better episode 18 The Prime Mover Fine concept bad execution I really have nothing more to say about The Prime Mover I hope you noticing a theme here because I could probably say that about all of these episode so far In Season 1 we had episode like Elegy that tried and failed but I feel like a lot of these episode fail to try Was gambling really the best plot they came up with because that boring a hell The message at the end is decent and the opening scene wa really well done but I expect more from this show 17 A Most Unusual Camera Have you ever read the Goosebumps book Say Cheese and Die This episode is essentially that It a fun concept that lead to some interesting scene but the episode doesn really know how to end the story The three lead and the doorman dying wa played for laugh in a way and while this episode isn exactly serious the light hearted tone just feel off 16 Mr Dingle the Strong Comedy and The Twilight Zone are like toothpaste and orange juice most of the time A lot of people actually consider Mr Dingle to be one of the worst episode I actually love it You can expect any amount of seriousness from an episode where the main character is named Dingle and this episode lean in to the absurdity Two headed Martians and midget Venusians take a lot of pleasure in messing with Mr Dingle because of how cookie cutter he is and that so funny to me The humor is not for everyone but nobody can deny Burgess Meredith natural charm He the best part of the episode by a long shot the whole thing probably wouldn have worked without him It not high art but this episode is better than it had any right to be and I wa genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it 15 The Howling Man I actually didn like The Howling Man when I first watched it The pacing feel way too fast and maybe it just me but Ellington performance kind of sucked A lot of the episode is just telling you what happened is happening which is weird in a show that master show don tell What finally sold me on this episode wa how creative it wa The set design the concept and the brilliant costume design make for an enjoyable viewing experience A few entry ago I bashed episode that I didn think tried to be interesting but here I going to applaud The Howling Man for it creativity even though it can be messy at time 14 A Penny for Your Thoughts This episode reminds me a lot of Mr Bevis from Season 1 but this episode isn cheesy a hell I actually thought Hector wa played by the same actor a Mr Bevis at first but I wa wrong Dick York natural charm is the highlight of this episode and his warm presence made this light hearted tale work It doesn reach the height of more iconic episode but I recommend this one if you in the mood for something light 13 Twenty Two There a theory that audience only remember the beginning and end of anything they watch and if that were 100 accurate then Twenty Two would be remembered a one of the best episode The opening scene is terrifying and I didn see the twist coming at all So why isn this higher up Because nothing that happens between those scene matter at all You could edit out the entire episode besides those two scene and have an outstanding 5 minute short film But I can get over the fact that 90 of this episode is meaningless 12 A Hundred Yards Over the Rim Remember The Last Flight This episode is almost exactly like that Having said that this episode worked in way that The Last Flight didn The stake here are more believable and it doe a better job of distinguishing the past from the present It not aesthetically beautiful by any mean but the visual storytelling here is a lot more dynamic than it wa in The Last Flight This episode isn just good in comparison to it predecessor it good on it own merit too but it easier to talk about why it good when you have this context 11 The Rip Van Winkle Caper Much like the last episode The Rip Van Winkle Caper took some note from Season 1 Specifically this episode is almost identical to I Shot an Arrow Into The Air apart from the twist I actually like this ending more than Arrow finding out that what they sacrificed everything for is worthless is one of my favorite way to end an episode That about the only thing that Caper doe better though A lot of what I loved about Arrow is in this episode but the execution of those same element wasn a spectacular Farwell bashing DeCruz with a bar of gold doesn have the same intensity a Corey shooting Donlin through his canteen Caper is still a good episode but I wouldn recommend it over Arrow 10 Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room I been pretty negative so far and I don like talking like that about The Twilight Zone The top ten episode of this season are the one that remind me just how much I love this show starting with Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room Eat your heart out MJ this is what it like to talk to the man in the mirror I don know if calling this a one man show is entirely accurate since Joe Mantell wa pulling double duty but in any case I loved his performance The mirror effect didn age perfectly but I never found it lame or dated This wa such a creative way of visualizing internal conflict and it wa pulled off masterfully 9 King Nine Will Not Return No I didn put King Nine 9th on purpose Much like the pilot of Season 1 King Nine feature a deserted man with no clue of why he in this situation I wouldn say that this is identical to Where Is Everybody but it a different way to tell the same story Bob Cummings wa outstanding a Embry I could feel his loneliness and desperation in every scene This episode took a unique interpretation of survivor guilt but it still relatable to the audience That not easy to do yet King Nine made it work 8 Night of the Meek Christmas Twilight Zone style I gladly put this in my holiday rotation because Rod Serling managed to capture the magic of the season without sacrificing emotion I never love the shot to tape format but Night of the Meek managed to work around it and create an aesthetic that somehow work with the style Art Carney is charming a hell which is fitting because the whole episode is charming a hell It one of the few episode that genuinely put a smile on my face and I can wait to watch it again in December 7 Long Distance Call You could interpret this episode in one of two way you can take it at face value and see it a the grandmother actually communicating from beyond the grave or you can be like me and see it a the griever just hearing what they want to hear We never hear her voice over the phone and that decision wa enough to let my imagination take over Everyone talk about Bill Mumy amazing performance but am I the only one who wa absolutely gutted by the father speech when he belief he talking to his dead mother This is a well acted beautifully written story about loss and I love it 6 Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up Any Rush fan in the house Anyone who heard their song Twilight Zone know the final reveal which is rightfully one of the most iconic image of the series The rest of the episode is a classic whodunnit and while I wish some of the passenger were more involved in the story it still a classic of the genre The final scene is what make this episode famous and I have nothing more to add besides saying that it a good a everyone say it is 5 Nick of Time I didn understand what the title meant until the ending which put everything we saw into a whole new light Realizing just how close Don and Pat came to becoming enslaved by the tyranny of fear and superstition wa mind blowing It the kind of twist that turn an already solid episode into a masterpiece and I really glad I didn know anything about it going in 4 The Invaders This episode left me speechless pun absolutely intended Modern writer love having silent episode a an experiment but I didn expect to see one from 60 year ago Agnes Moorhead carry this episode not through her relatable character but through pure fear and tension Since I can exactly compliment the writing I gonna give a lot of praise to the director who made every scene perfect without dialogue One thing that I missed in Season 2 wa the Space Age atmosphere since a lot of my favorite episode from last season dealt with attitude hope and fear that mankind had at the time The twist at the end of The Invaders is the closest we get to those idea capping off a brilliant episode 3 The Obsolete Man I wa tempted to just have a three way tie for first place instead of having episode in second or third I didn do that however because I feel like that would have been a cop out Having said that The Obsolete Man wa a serious contender for the top spot thanks to Burgess Meredith and Fritz Weaver We saw Fritz in Third From the Sun but he ascended to a whole new level in The Obsolete Man The Chancellor is a performative showman in front of his audience but cold and calculating when he alone with Wordsworth That brings me to Burgess Meredith and this is his best performance of the series so far It a better performance than Time Enough At Last he that damn good These two master of their craft have a long power struggle with both men losing and assuming control throughout the episode The two set serve a their arena and I can decide whether I love the iconic courtroom or the intimate apartment setting more I don even know what to say about the writing I can only describe it a Rod Serling dancing with the English language I read somewhere that Rod wrote 48 of the show first 65 episode which is goddamn insane He showed sign of burnout throughout Season 2 but he wa able to finish the season with a masterpiece of an episode 2 Shadow Play If The Obsolete Man is elegant in it simplicity Shadow Play is a brain bending affair where everything needed to be perfect for the episode to not crash and burn Needless to say it work Philosophy major will love this episode for it reimagining of Plato Cave but the rest of u will have fun trying to put the piece together In the past I critiqued episode for raising too many question but Shadow Play is very deliberate about what the question it want to answer There a line between complex andconfusing and Shadow Play make all of it moving part work I genuinely didn know whether or not he wa dreaming and I still have fun thinking about what real and what isn In order for this episode to work I needed to buy into it premise which wa easy thanks to Dennis Weaver performance a Adam Grant I didn know whether or not to believe the mad bastard but he wa just that engaging This is what happens when a show take a huge risk and commits to it execution and the first thing I wanted to do after finishing Shadow Play wa watch it again It wa almost number one but I think you know what gonna take the top spot 1 Eye of the Beholder You never forget the first time you watch Eye of the Beholder It is by far the best twist in the franchise Since we don see any face for the first 20 minute the episode ha to communicate through dialogue and body language Hiding the face took creative lighting blocking and cinematography and I can forgive the very few moment where a face appears through the shadow because the overall effort wa a technical masterpiece The writing speaks for itself I think my favorite scene wa the state isn God conversation The twist is so mind blowing that you might miss the Leader conformity speech which is hauntingly relevant to this day This episode is outstanding in every element that I could talk about and that why it the best episode of Season 2,Ranking Every Twilight Zone Episode Season Two,Have you ever listened to The White Album in it entirety Everyone know classic While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Birthday but the album ha a lot of filler song that are quite frankly shit For every Happiness is a Warm Gun there a Revolution 9 That kind of how I feel about Season 2 There a sharp divide in quality the good episode are great and the bad episode are REALLY bad As I kept watching I couldn figure out why episode were so hit and miss but then I had an epiphany To put it one way the episode at the top of this list went out of their way to capitalize on their premise and create a memorable experience On the other hand you had episode that had interesting setup but couldn stick the landing which can be frustrating knowing what this show is capable of I guess you could say that compared to the first season Season 2 had a lower floor but a much higher ceiling and you find out why in just a moment 29 The Whole Truth This episode end with a joke about Khrushchev being tricked into buying a car that force him to tell the truth and for that it going to hell I sure the ending killed in 1960 but in 2019 it just dated As a whole the episode never go beyond it one note joke but the ending not only make it the worst episode of the season but quite possibly the worst of the series 28 A Thing About Machines A Thing About Machines is somehow more boring than it title A man getting attacked by household appliance shouldn be le interesting than watching your grandfather yell at his flip phone but here we are The only good part of this episode is Rod Serling giving his opening monologue from a TV screen As much a I love Rod he shouldn be the only part of an episode that I can look at and say yeah I did like that 27 The Man in the Bottle This episode ha a tone problem The second wish ha Arthur wish for a million dollar only to have it taxed away which is almost too realistic to be entertaining The third wish turn him into Hitler With his fourth wish everything return to normal and there an oh shuck I guess everything worked out in the end vibe but I sorry can we go back to the part where a man literally became Adolf Hitler That not a twist that a parody of a twist As for the rest of the episode it a story about a genie so it exactly what you expect but I didn expect to see Godwin Law in the Twilight Zone 26 Static Oh boy I finally get to talk about the episode that were shot to tape instead of filmed normally It wa a cost cutting measure that all but ruined the six episode it wa used it and Static is the worst of them all Ever play a game on an old PC where you have to bring the graphic to their lowest setting and even then the framerate still lag That what watching Static is like The story is basically Sixteen Millimeter Shrine but worse which lead me to a tangent a lot of episode this season were nearly identical to one Season 1 and very rarely did they improve on the original There isn nothing to like about Static but the con heavily outweigh any pro here 25 The Mind and the Matter I not saying Rod didn have a sense of humor but he should have stuck to drama What we have here is an episode that try to be fun and light hearted but just isn I do like the twist that most certainly inspired Being John Malkovich but that about it That my problem with Season 2 episode don suck in a unique way that fun to talk about they just suck 24 The Lateness of the Hour Here we have another episode ruined by it experimental filming but that not the only thing going on here I had a really hard time coming up with word to describe how I feel about The Lateness of the Hour but I know I can just say it bad and leave it at that I had to watch this episode twice because I couldn figure out why I should care about Jana The story is really simple but the execution wasn consistent at all Each scene felt like it belonged in a different episode which is weird because there nothing too complex going on here The twist is fine I guess but if I don care about the first 23 minute the last 2 aren going to change much 23 The Trouble With Templeton It Walking Distance but worse There I said all I had to say about this episode Besides the scene where Templeton leaf and all of the ghost stop acting a the light fade which is admittedly really good nothing stand out Nothing else blew me away but nothing particularly sucked either It a neutral a an episode of The Twilight Zone can get 22 The Silence In my first list I said that Mirror Image wa an episode that I didn understand why people liked and Season 2 equivalent is The Silence The premise is honestly really good a man ha to stay silent for a year and the twist ending could have been shockingly effective There really only one flaw with this episode but it a flaw that ruin everything it doesn feel like he stayed silent for a whole year We spend very little time with Tennyson when he alone in his room and the timeline jump ahead month at a time He could have been in there for a week for all we know and that bad news for an episode that need to sell u on his suffering Of all the episode so far this one had the most potential to be good maybe a longer running time would have helped 21 Back There The first half of Back There is really good I love how the philosophy behind the episode is laid out in what is essentially a group of guy shooting the shit over a game of card John Wilkes Booth a a cartoony OTT villain is surprisingly entertaining Peter on the other hand doesn really have a character He about a average a a protagonist can get and I couldn get invested in him As strong a the episode started it just sort of fizzled out in the end What we have here is an episode with a lot of good quality that isn better than the sum of it part There outstanding concept going on but the execution doesn do any of them justice 20 Dust Dust in an episode with a lot of good element The final third in particular wa really well done from the father hopelessly throwing dust at his son to one of Rod Serling best closing monologue I only have one major flaw with the episode but like The Silence it a critical flaw The main character is a convicted child murderer who basically walked away with no punishment The theme of forgiveness is a powerful one but it would have worked so much better if Luis wa wrongly convicted or at least guilty of a much le heinous crime I know that the point of this episode wa to challenge our conception of punishment and I didn exactly want Luis to hang but he not a character where I can say yeah he deserves to walk away with no sentence If you can get past that then you enjoy Dust a lot more than I did 19 The Odyssey of Flight 33 I wanted this to be a lot better than it wa but Flight 33 come nowhere close to reaching it potential It an episode so wrapped up in asking why is this happening without giving u a reason to care And When the Sky Was Opened wa an episode where you didn know why the astronaut were disappearing but the concept and character were so intriguing that you can help but be engaged Flight 33 focused more on having realistic pilot lingo than making the pilot interesting There wa one scene with two of the passenger talking and I think more scene like that would have made me invested in their plight I have no reason to care that the plane is gonna Quantum Leap for all eternity which suck because that concept could have made for a much better episode 18 The Prime Mover Fine concept bad execution I really have nothing more to say about The Prime Mover I hope you noticing a theme here because I could probably say that about all of these episode so far In Season 1 we had episode like Elegy that tried and failed but I feel like a lot of these episode fail to try Was gambling really the best plot they came up with because that boring a hell The message at the end is decent and the opening scene wa really well done but I expect more from this show 17 A Most Unusual Camera Have you ever read the Goosebumps book Say Cheese and Die This episode is essentially that It a fun concept that lead to some interesting scene but the episode doesn really know how to end the story The three lead and the doorman dying wa played for laugh in a way and while this episode isn exactly serious the light hearted tone just feel off 16 Mr Dingle the Strong Comedy and The Twilight Zone are like toothpaste and orange juice most of the time A lot of people actually consider Mr Dingle to be one of the worst episode I actually love it You can expect any amount of seriousness from an episode where the main character is named Dingle and this episode lean in to the absurdity Two headed Martians and midget Venusians take a lot of pleasure in messing with Mr Dingle because of how cookie cutter he is and that so funny to me The humor is not for everyone but nobody can deny Burgess Meredith natural charm He the best part of the episode by a long shot the whole thing probably wouldn have worked without him It not high art but this episode is better than it had any right to be and I wa genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it 15 The Howling Man I actually didn like The Howling Man when I first watched it The pacing feel way too fast and maybe it just me but Ellington performance kind of sucked A lot of the episode is just telling you what happened is happening which is weird in a show that master show don tell What finally sold me on this episode wa how creative it wa The set design the concept and the brilliant costume design make for an enjoyable viewing experience A few entry ago I bashed episode that I didn think tried to be interesting but here I going to applaud The Howling Man for it creativity even though it can be messy at time 14 A Penny for Your Thoughts This episode reminds me a lot of Mr Bevis from Season 1 but this episode isn cheesy a hell I actually thought Hector wa played by the same actor a Mr Bevis at first but I wa wrong Dick York natural charm is the highlight of this episode and his warm presence made this light hearted tale work It doesn reach the height of more iconic episode but I recommend this one if you in the mood for something light 13 Twenty Two There a theory that audience only remember the beginning and end of

235,ShouldStickToLurking,1,I beginning to wonder if the original episode started out a the original Seth Rogan episode they began shooting and somewhere during production post production they started reading the show review and decided to do a little writing Peele make a comment about the monologue being a little too on the nose and preachy I doubt they were trying to include preachy heavy handed writing in previous episode just to set up this line and I find it hard to believe that he addressing just the one line they were talking about The writer then begin to explain herself and her responsibility a a writer IMO your only responsibility a an artist is to yourself and if others want to support your art after seeing what you done for yourself so be it But that just an OPINION and I don feel like the character opinion took away from the story at all It made it stronger I feel like there were a couple line like this especially during the chase scene while she meta discussed the episode she wa in I think this wa the writer attempting to explain their logic and if so I believe it wa done softly and very well I also think they threw in the trope filled chase scene complete with twisted ankle cry convincing herself it all just sleep deprivation jump scare etc to address the main character distaste for cheap thriller and to bore the audience by showing them how cheap the thrill could have been For those who don know Blurryman is commonly used a a representation of the faceless mass critic There a chance that Blurryman started out a a ghoul the angry ghost of Serling but ended up being a way to address the angry faceless critic who were coming after the writer Something doesn feel right when imagining the writer sitting around writing a blurry character terrorizing a person mercilessly then just randomly showing their face and holding their hand and calling it their best way to honor Serling Fuck but then again they been building up to it with Blurryman cameo for a whole season so it might just be that thinly written I just felt like all those scene during the chase were made for something else It doesn feel like they wrote all that just to have the blurry character come out of the shadow and say Surprise motherfucker It your idol I just been messing with you because I so well revered a a people person and decided to become a murderous demon to help you out The ending the discussion about closing your eye to the thing you think aren important childish I feel like this wa the staff addressing their lack of monster of the week sci fi and campfire story episode A lot of the comment here seem to think that this wa insulting the viewer and telling them that they SHOULD close their eye to the childish thing and focus on the important stuff the message but I heard the line a the exact opposite I felt like the Serling line were pointing out to the writer that if you close your eye off to the thing that you think aren important you lose the greater meaning of the message and that she shouldn JUST focus on the message or she only seeing half the picture Maybe it me but I felt like the staff heard the response to the show scrambled to do a write I think Peele even poke fun at himself and the need for a last second rewrite in this episode in some meta meta used it a an opportunity to address the audience and have Serling himself explain to the writer what the audience felt then usher her on to Season 2 where she can take those message with her and use it to write episode that don forget about the childish thing that made the original series so well balanced and entertaining I hope God I hope Also not a huge fan of the CGI but they didn TOTALLY butcher it When his head turned the nose mouth looked completely off and they probably could used a few second le on his face so we wouldn notice but the voice actor that played Serling did a great job There wa a part where it sounded like they cut and paste old sound bite with terrible pacing and different inflection on mid sentence word so they could use his original voice in newly written line Not so great But still if anything this episode make me hopeful If I right about the write I incredibly optimistic about Season 2 seeing how well they addressed the audience criticism in this episode Assuming that what they did Otherwise it would be an anticipated defense to writing they weren confident would sell to the audience and an excuse to use the finale to tell the audience why they wrote the series the way they did give themselves a little

265,nulldrone,1,It like seeing people with their their clothes off I never imagined people were like that You know we do thing without thinking about them at all Hector amp x200B Often in these story where a character gain a supernatural power they abuse it lose it and occasionally learn from it The Twilight Zone is smart enough not to get bogged down by one story archetype so it construct a spectrum of character a recipient of these power Sometimes it a nasty couple who instantly turn to gaming a racetrack and sometimes it a poor couple who get carried away The type of character that receives this power and their reaction to it is the crux of the story that support the inevitable twist A more cruel version of this story would have Hector immediately acknowledge his telepathy and use it to manipulate others only to end with everyone being able to read his thought Not to say that story couldn be enjoyable but it would get old pretty fast Those rumor floating around that this show head is up it own zone would be substantiated Hector pride himself on his attention to duty and hasn missed a day of work He work hard but people don think much of him Thus his newfound power serve not to punish him but to assist him on his journey in becoming more assertive Hector B Poole human coin is about to be spit out by a one armed bandit and chucked back into the hectic stock market TZ is up 0 25 amp x200B I be upfront this is a comedic episode Now I know what you thinking a comedic episode In my Twilight Zone But I wanted a mordant look into the human condition Yes the Twilight Zone ha it fair share of comedic episode that have generally been maligned and forgotten by the public I tend to like these comedic episode more than your average person As an anthology series versatility can only benefit the series a a whole even if they produce weaker individual component It easy to think of the Twilight Zone a this monolith of spook twist and sci fi stuff and forget how cheesy whimsical and warm it can be The Twilight Zone wa always a look into the imagination the human spirit that cannot be shackled to a single tone Dick York really shine here I like him better here than in The Purple Testament and I not surprised he settled into a more comedic role Though that line about mind reading is a lot funnier in hindsight I particularly liked the joke about the empty headed rich girl easy joke but Dick really sell it Also the prompt I fired without even having to read Bagby mind There also a fun moment where he press his nose against the glass and quickly wipe it Schlocky but charming Also I tend not to be critical of acting because it not my field but I wasn a fan of Dan Tobin here and Cyril Delevanti wa weirdly melodramatic June Dayton did okay The nature of this concept force long stretch of time with character doing mundane task with blank expression which doesn give them a lot to work with There humor in how the line were recorded separately and dubbed over some unintentional If nothing else it serf to highlight how divorced one mask one outer demeanor and appearance can be from their innermost thought I don like how Serling frame Hector a a human coin The idea of a coin landing on it side causing something supernatural isn the worst idea but it doesn really tie in thematically with anything Apparently in an earlier draft the car accident gave Hector his power so it feel rather arbitrary It not like Hector particularly duplicitous or indecisive in a Harvey Dent esque manner The closest thematic use of the coin duality go with the whole thought behavior dichotomy which isn terribly insightful and is mostly used for joke Also coin bank Great I suppose the one advantage of this impetus is that it impermanent This episode wave over how telepathy is a curse in disguise with a brief bit of dialogue on how Hectors ear are ringing We don exactly know how these power work When Hector is eavesdropping on Mr Smithers he slinks closer a if it easier to hear him Very strange It not a huge deal since this episode focus more on Hector character growth over the supernatural power which wa a good choice overall I might liked it more if there were more jab around the people who funnel into the banking institution maybe we even could had a swell character moment where Hector generously give out a loan to a struggling mother and work extra hard or something to make up for that The first act certainly could been more ergonomic So how about that character arc It pretty decent I guess You get the impression Hector the sort who think the best of people and realizing their true intention spur him to be le forgiving Helen role is somewhat thankless a she basically the guiding light that tell Hector what to do Granted he need someone to confide in though you really have to wonder what their relationship wa like before the episode Despite this Hector at least ha the agency to give Mr Brant the ol water to the face and give Smithers a well earned vacation the conviction already there Also they probably get married at the end like in your standard comedy Penny for your thought nickel for a kiss and all that Later down the line she reveal her own magical power and hijinks will ensue Smithers also serf a a cautionary tale in what spinelessness and passivity can do to someone stuck in a mind numbing job for decade A lot of the dialogue is pretty transparent I a big champion of show don tell but I get that it come with the territory Smithers candidness also work a a counterbalance to how deceptive most everyone is So basically Hector learns about the evil that lurk within the heart of men We get adultery fraud and standard villainy But in the end Hector end up blackmailing Mr Bagby to get a promotion Are we supposed to see Hector action a good and just This is another problem with the way information is conveyed we never really see Hector work hard or demonstrate kindness Helen just tell u this and she crushing on him I think she a little biased Giving everyone else villainous thought and getting u to feel bad for Hector doesn cut it You could read this episode very cynically the society we constructed is rife with corruption and the only way to get ahead is to be equally corrupt This episode presupposes that Hector is a good person and will use his newfound confidence virtuously but that not good enough And even if this were the case would it be justified The Twilight Zone morality is generally warped in a questionably simplistic way if you a good person good thing will happen and vice versa The end often justify the mean The story the Twilight Zone tell are wrapped in allegory and parable so you can choose to take away basic message working hard showing kindness and being confident are virtue I don think this harsh take wa Johnson intention but it just hang there like a thin layer of gum coating a shiny penny Normally I all for darker subtext behind lighthearted episode but this feel like an oversight It doesn ruin the episode or anything just food for penny And I know you probably going wow way to totally nitpick this goofy comedy episode If there one thing that unites the comedic and dramatic episode it the show moral compass Many episode are contingent on it And that worthy of discussion I think This episode also mark the first appearance of the goofy goggles in these review The goofy goggles are a pair of comically oversized glass that show up a few time throughout the series They aren always the exact same prop they spooky like that Hector seems to be near sighted and the glass are mostly used to show his confusion a everybody around him is suddenly an expert ventriloquist They also break after the car accident gaining some sympathy point for Hector A woman near the beginning ha a strange thought If Liz and Eddie split up then Liz can marry Rock and Eddie can marry Tuesday Uh huh What Are we doing Wordplay again amp x200B This is George Clayton Johnson first teleplay for this series No middleman I generally enjoy his writing he give the Twilight Zone a unique energy I feel his greatest strength is latching onto a certain emotion and creating a story that capture it perfectly I suppose in this case that emotion is the humor in the thought behavior dichotomy This is a solid script overall but it somewhat muddled and the pacing and exposition leave something to be desired Granted some of the cynicism is intentional and inherent in a concept like this and it wa wise to take on this concept in a more comedic direction In a way comedic episode can get away with more by appealing to pathos we feel bad for Hector so when he get his promotion and get the girl we left with a sense of catharsis regardless of how we got there Giving Smithers his trip to Bermuda wa sweet And don get me wrong it is pretty funny even if it relies on the lead actor I mean a lot of episode are like that So a a lighter addition

sort who think the best of people and realizing their true intention spur him to be le forgiving Helen role is somewhat thankless a she basically the guiding light that tell Hector what to do Granted he need someone to confide in though you really have to wonder what their relationship wa like before the episode Despite this Hector at least ha the agency to give Mr Brant the ol water to the face and give Smithers a well earned vacation the conviction already there Also they probably get married at the end like in your standard comedy Penny for your thought nickel for a kiss and all that And then she reveals her own magical power and hijinks ensue Smithers also serf a a cautionary tale of what spinelessness and passivity can do to someone left in a mind numbing job for decade A lot of the dialogue is pretty transparent I a big champion of show don tell but I get that it come with the territory Smithers candidness also work a a counterbalance to how deceptive most everyone is So basically Hector learns about the evil that lurk within the heart of men We get adultery fraud and standard villainy But in the end Hector end up blackmailing Mr Bagby to get a promotion Are we supposed to see Hector action a good and just This is another problem with the way information is conveyed we never really see Hector work hard or demonstrate kindness Helen just tell u this and she crushing on him I think she a little biased Giving everyone else villainous thought and getting u to feel bad for Hector doesn cut it You could read this episode very cynically the society we constructed is rife with corruption and the only way to get ahead is to be equally corrupt This episode presupposes that Hector is a good person and will use his newfound confidence virtuously but that not good enough And even if this were the case would it be justified The Twilight Zone morality is generally warped in a questionably simplistic way if you a good person good thing will happen and vice versa The end often justify the mean The story the Twilight Zone tell are wrapped in allegory and parable so you can choose to take away basic message working hard showing kindness and being confident are virtue I don think this harsh take wa Johnson intention but it just hang there like a thin layer of gum coating a shiny penny Normally I all for darker subtext behind lighthearted episode but this feel like an oversight It doesn ruin the episode or anything just food for penny And I know you probably going wow way to totally nitpick this goofy comedy episode If there one thing that unites the comedic and dramatic episode it the show moral compass Many episode are contingent on it And that worthy of discussion I think This episode also mark the first appearance of the goofy goggles in these review The goofy goggles are a pair of comically oversized glass that show up a few time throughout the series They aren always the exact same prop they spooky like that Hector seems to be near sighted and the glass are mostly used to show his confusion a everybody around him is suddenly an expert ventriloquist They also break after the car accident gaining some sympathy point for Hector A woman near the beginning ha a strange thought If Liz and Eddie split up then Liz can marry Rock and Eddie can marry Tuesday Uh huh What Are we doing Wordplay again amp x200B This is George Clayton Johnson first teleplay for this series No middleman I generally enjoy his writing he give the Twilight Zone a unique energy I feel his greatest strength is latching onto a certain emotion and creating a story that capture it perfectly I suppose in this case that emotion is the humor in the thought behavior dichotomy This is a solid script overall but it somewhat muddled and the pacing and exposition leave something to be desired Granted some of the cynicism is inherent and intentional in a concept like this and it wa wise to take on this concept in a more comedic light In a way comedic episode can get away with a little more by appealing to pathos we feel bad for Hector so when he get his promotion and get the girl we left with a sense of catharsis regardless of how we got there Giving Smithers his trip to Bermuda wa sweet And don get me wrong it is pretty funny even if it relies on the lead actor I mean a lot of episode are like that So a a lighter addition to the Twilight Zone it doe exactly what it supposed to do Heads tail it on it side Spin it around and you can see everything clearly Also I posting these review on BlogSpot too You know if you want to read them twice or put them in a feed or something Read all about it http the groan zone blogspot com 2019 05 cloning to blogspot html NOTE History ha been made This is the first Groan Zone review that I assume ha been caught in the spam filter If this happens more I just post these on BlogSpot and drop link here Less people reading is better than no people reading,The Groan Zone A Penny for Your Thoughts Review,It like seeing people with their their clothes off I never imagined people were like that You know we do thing without thinking about them at all Hector amp x200B Often in these story where a character gain a supernatural power they abuse it lose it and occasionally learn from it The Twilight Zone is smart enough not to get bogged down by one story archetype so it construct a spectrum of character a recipient of these power Sometimes it a nasty couple who instantly turn to gaming a racetrack and sometimes it a poor couple who get carried away The type of character that receives this power and their reaction to it is the crux of the story that support the inevitable twist A more cruel version of this story would have Hector immediately acknowledge his telepathy and use it to manipulate others only to end with everyone being able to read his thought Not to say that story couldn be enjoyable but it would get old pretty fast Those rumor floating around that this show head is up it own zone would be substantiated Hector pride himself on his attention to duty and hasn missed a day of work He work hard but people don think much of him Thus the supernatural element serf not to punish him but to assist him on his journey in becoming more assertive Hector B Poole human coin is about to be spit out by a one armed bandit and chucked back into the hectic stock market TZ is up 0 25 amp x200B I be upfront this is a comedic episode Now I know what you thinking a comedic episode In my Twilight Zone But I wanted a mordant look into the human condition Yes the Twilight Zone ha it fair share of comedic episode that have generally been maligned and forgotten by the public I tend to like these comedic episode more than your average person As an anthology series versatility can only benefit the series a a whole even if they produce weaker individual episode It easy to think of the Twilight Zone a this monolith of spook twist and sci fi stuff and forget how cheesy whimsical and warm it can be The Twilight Zone wa always a look into the imagination the human spirit that cannot be shackled to a single tone Dick York make this episode I like him better here than The Purple Testament and I not surprised he settled into a more comedic role Though that line about mind reading is a lot funnier in hindsight I particularly liked the joke about the empty headed rich girl easy joke but Dick really sell it Also the prompt I fired without even having to read Bagby mind There also a fun moment where he press his nose against the glass and quickly wipe it Schlocky but charming Also I tend not to be critical of acting because it not my jurisdiction but I wasn a fan of Dan Tobin here and Cyril Delevanti wa weirdly melodramatic June Dayton did okay The nature of this concept force long stretch of time with character doing mundane task with blank expression which doesn give them a ton to work with There humor in how the line were recorded separately and dubbed over some of it unintentional If nothing else it serf to highlight how divorced one mask one outer demeanor and appearance can be from their innermost thought I don like how Serling frame Hector a a human coin The idea of a coin landing on it side causing something supernatural isn the worst idea but it doesn really tie in thematically with anything Apparently in an earlier draft the car accident gave Hector his power so it feel rather arbitrary It not like Hector particularly duplicitous or indecisive in a Harvey Dent esque manner The closest thematic use of the coin duality go with the whole thought behavior dichotomy which isn terribly insightful and is mostly used for joke Also coin bank Great I suppose the one advantage of this impetus is that it impermanent This episode wave over how telepathy is a curse in disguise with a brief bit of dialogue on how Hectors ear are ringing We don exactly know how these power work When Hector is eavesdropping on Mr Smithers he slinks closer a if it easier to hear him Very strange It not a huge deal since this episode focus more on Hector character growth over the supernatural power which wa a good choice overall I might liked it more if there were more jab around the people who funnel into the banking institution maybe we even could had a swell character moment where Hector generously give out a loan to a struggling mother and work extra hard or something to make up for that The first act certainly could been more ergonomic So how about that character arc It pretty decent I guess You get the impression Hector the sort who think the

270,OneTrueBrody,1,I recently took on the Herculean task of ranking every single episode of The Twilight Zone and so far I made it through Season 2 For now my plan is to share my ranking for every season individually and when I finally done I can reveal my overall list with all 156 episode Season 1 is a really strong season There were so many iconic episode that I wa excited to watch for the first time and I found a lot of hidden gem Even the episode I didn think were top 10 material were good and a a whole I think this season set a high bar for the rest of the series Having said that the few episode that I consider bad were REALLY bad and you find out why in just a moment I wanted to make this list a objective a possible so I didn just put my favorite episode at the top just because they my favorite Even then this list is still just my own personal opinion and my idea of a good episode will probably be different than yours In any case I hope you enjoy this list for what it is let me know what you think in the comment 36 The Mighty Casey Well something had to be at the bottom and I actually disappointed with how much this episode sucked I love baseball and I usually love baseball inspired medium but watching this episode felt like watching your favorite team getting blown out by their biggest rival I can forgive the cheesy sound effect for Casey pitch because it still an episode from the 1960 but the idea of a robot needing a heart in order to play baseball is a stretch That same heart causing the robot to lose it competitive drive is actively frustrating There not one element of this episode that I consider good If you want something that feel like the Twilight Zone take on baseball just watch Field of Dreams 35 The Chaser This show is 60 year old and value have changed a lot since then William Shatner saying his girlfriend is treating him like a retarded child in Nick of Time hasn aged well but this is genuinely uncomfortable to watch When I look at Roger all I can see is a creepy incel who date rape a woman and robs her of her humanity I don sympathize with this piece of shit and the twist make me feel horrible for Leela I do like the inclusion of A Daemon get it and if he wa the protagonist then maybe I could get behind this episode The only reason it isn at the bottom is because it actually somewhat well written at least structurally Still this is the only episode that I wanted to turn off halfway through and that unforgivable 34 Elegy Elegy feel more like a parody of The Twilight Zone than an actual episode I don expect special effect from sixty year ago to age perfectly but if the premise relies on our bland and indistinguishable astronaut seeing people frozen in time maybe don include the shot where people are obviously blinking and twitching I don like how the final scene is basically a monologue explaining everything it such a lazy way to deliver information It an incompetent episode but it almost so bad it good That not enough to put it higher on the list but here we are 33 A Nice Place to Visit The idea of your own personal Heaven actually be Hell is interesting but it a premise that is tricky to maintain for a full episode You have to balance the pleasure with the dissatisfaction that come with getting everything you ever wanted and this episode botched the execution It implied that Pip is able to control thing such a the odds of Rocky winning at the casino and the risk of getting caught robbing a bank If you able to ask for condition like this even a semi confident buffoon could make this Hell work for them There wa some fun to be had but that revelation took the sting out of the entire episode 32 The Fever Was this supposed to be scary There a scene where Franklin is talking about the slot machine a if it wa an entity out for his soul and the scene ha an intense air to it Then we see the walking talking slot machine and it just too ridiculous to be scary The rest of the episode is nothing special and Franklin go from being anti gambling to being stark raving mad way too quickly 31 Mirror Image This is the first entry that I think people will disagree with me on because it seems like everybody like this episode except for me The performance receive a lot of praise and it honestly not undeserved Thing is nearly every episode is well acted and the acting in Mirror Image doesn elevate the rest of the episode like Jack Klugman performance in A Passage for Trumpet but I getting ahead of myself Besides the acting I don get the appeal of this episode Doppelgängers are creepy but the story begin and end at a woman see her clone twice The character aren fleshed out enough for me to care about them so I can empathize with Millicent fear or Paul concern The ending is also more confusing than anything ambiguous ending can work really well but this one raise a lot of question that I quite frankly don care to find answer to 30 A World of Difference I really wanted to like A World of Difference partly because it another decently popular episode but mostly because of how much I love The Truman Show This episode just made me want to watch The Truman Show because any good thing I could say about it wa done much better in that movie and many others with a similar premise The body of the episode doesn work for me because Gerry isn developed beyond alcoholic with a bitch wife and the role he loses himself into is barely defined at all credit where it due that last point is actually explored in the episode Also the ending rip off Sixteen Millimeter Shrine 29 Mr Bevis I been negative so far but this is the last episode on the list that I consider bad and even then I don dislike Mr Bevis The problem with this episode is how saccharine it is It feel like how It a Wonderful Life would look if George Bailey wa only mildly annoyed with his life Henry Bevis never wanted to change everything about himself he just had one crummy day that he like to fix At time it a charming love letter to the world goober but too often it feel like the pilot for a show called Leave it to Bevis 28 A World of His Own A writer whose creation come to life is a great idea with a lot of creative direction to go in Unfortunately we only get to see Greg create Mary and an elephant and later destroy his wife The writing is solid enough and I wa never bored watching this episode but it could have gone so much further with it premise I do love Rod cameo at the end it hard to believe that this wa the first time we actually saw his face 27 What You Need By now you probably sensing a theme with my ranking I hate seeing great premise ruined by weak execution What You Need is that concept defined The opening scene with the peddler in the bar is great the middle where Fred try to partner up with him doesn go anywhere and the ending where Pedott say he had to kill Fred because he would have killed him otherwise doesn make any sense If this guy could predict the future why would he give Fred the scissors or the pen in the first place I had so many question coming out of this episode that I felt like I wa being too nitpicky and I hate feeling that way when I talking about a show I otherwise adore 26 Execution Great premise weird execution get it The first act is amazing there very little I would have done differently The second half go completely off the rail with our favorite outlaw going all Encino Man when he venture into modern society The ending wa completely out of place did the burglar need to exist at all As much of a mess a it is this wa actually a really fun episode to watch I just couldn justify putting it any higher on this list It hardly the best episode but it the type of episode that I return to whenever I in the right mood for it 25 Escape Clause I don really care for deal with the devil story because of how predictable they are Escape Clause is about a standard a they come It so standard that I actually having trouble coming up with anything to say about it It competent but not all that creative There are worse episode but at least The Mighty Casey and A Nice Place to Visit gave me something to talk about I don even hate it but I also don like it As Twilight Zone episode go it room temperature tap water 24 Third From the Sun The Twilight Zone ha a knack for social commentary that is still relevant after 60 year Third From the Sun ha lost some of it impact now that we not trying to blow each other to kingdom come but it still an effective episode The episode doe a good job at creating tension and a sense of urgency and the acting wa pretty good What brings the episode down however is the random old man trying to stop our protagonist from escaping I get that the episode needed a villain but it had to be this guy I know nothing about his character and quite frankly I don care enough about him for his inclusion to have any effect on me The message wa probably more effective in 1959 but it pretty good for a time capsule so to speak 23 Mr Denton on Doomsday This is one of those episode that grew on me the more I thought about it I didn like it at first because it doe kind of beat you over the head with it message the night Fate stepped in anyone But I kept thinking about it and the twist is genuinely one of the more heartwarming one I love how giving Denton his life back mean never letting the other kid go down the same road he did It one of the better Western episode of the first two season all thing considered 22 The Last Flight This would have been a great episode if the story wasn entirely delivered through dialogue The story of a pilot traveling through time in order to rectify his cowardice is excellent on it own but I would have rather seen his deed in action rather than hear about them in the past tense I a firm believer of show don tell and this episode tell u a lot more than it show I do enjoy this episode for it story and message but it deserved a better execution 21 Big Tall Wish Let me get something out of the way the scene where Bolie is talking to the promoter is entirely worthless take up way too much screentime and drag the episode down Everything else about The Big Tall Wish is amazing Bolie Jackson is such a great underdog and Henry is the perfect wide eyed child The cinematography when Henry make his wish is so clever yet so simple Bolie telling Henry to stop believing Bolie ving in wish and missing out on his second chance is genuinely heartbreaking It a shame that so much time is dedicated to one meaningless scene because a simple rewrite would have brought this episode into Top 10 territory I just spitballing here but imagine replacing that one scene with a few short scene of Bolie winning fight thanks to Henry wish That would have made the ending that much more powerful 20 The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine We reached the point where I get to start talking about the episode I really love If I wa ranking this solely on how much I liked the episode this would be in the top ten This is one of those episode that might not be a memorable if it wasn for the acting so it a good thing that every actor is at the top of their game especially Ida Lupino a Barbie The Twilight Zone love nostalgia and this episode is a character study of a woman who loses herself to her pursuit of the past After Barbie get chewed out by the director even I started to sympathize with her desire to go back in time I been told that this is really similar to Sunset Boulevard which I haven seen but on it own it definitely an episode worth watching even though I wouldn call it one of the elite episode 19 The Four of Us Are Dying Again this an episode that I enjoy a lot more than my ranking suggests A man who can change his face at will is an awesome concept and the story we got explores that concept really well I love the visual presentation of this episode from the noir aesthetic to the clever way they hide the moment where the actor switch out The only reason it isn higher is because the episode end just a it start getting interesting It one of the few episode that I think would have benefited from Season 4 extended run time I love the episode we got I just wanted more 18 People are Alike All Over Honestly This is a good episode that I don have a lot to say about I take note after finishing each episode and after I watched this one I had a lot of trouble finding anything to write I did enjoy it the twist is awesome and I loved the one line let me know what I dying for but honestly a lot of the episode just felt like filler The only scene I can remember in any sort of detail wa the ending There wa that one Martian woman who feel bad about putting our hero in captivity and if she wa more developed it could have been great It one of those episode I feel like I need to rewatch when I go ahead and make my overall list 17 A Stop at Willoughby I don think there a single fan of the show who dislike this episode myself included It wa actually a personal favorite of Rod Serling himself It a really solid episode that doe so many thing right but it doesn do any one thing better than other Twilight Zone episode Walking Distance is better at romanticizing nostalgia Time Enough at Last ha a better portrayal of a man who want to escape from the world and I could go on but I don want to seem like I piling on this episode because I do really like it James Daly gave a great performance and the final shot is one hell of an ending It a solid 8 in a season that gave u a lot of 9 and 10 which just go to show how strong the competition wa 16 Perchance to Dream Perchance to Dream ha some of the slickest cinematography of the entire season I actually like the aesthetic of the real world a lot more than the dream sequence but the latter scene still look incredible I not the biggest fan of the story but Richard Conte performance allowed me to buy into everything that wa going on It wa all just a dream ending are almost always lame to me but it worked here better than it ha in other show movie I seen 15 One for the Angels Admit it you smiled when Mr Death told Lou you made it The ending is so sweet and iconic that you start to forget just how tight the writing is for the rest of the episode Ed Wynn and Murray Hamilton have outstanding chemistry making Death seem more like a friend than something to be feared It only the second episode which make it even more remarkable considering how well rounded it is 14 The Lonely The Lonely is another episode that could have been perfect with a longer running time but I still love this episode a it is The concept is pure 1950 futurism and the setup before Alicia introduction wa outstanding The final act wa also incredibly well done I could feel Corry connection to Alicia and the dilemma he found himself in I just wish their relationship wa more developed which is exactly why The Lonely deserved a longer runtime or at least made better use of the time it had It wa a great episode that I highly recommend but it wasn a strong a the thirteen episode ahead of it on this list 13 The Hitch Hiker Not gonna lie I enjoyed this episode a lot more when I watched it for the first time a few year ago Is it a great episode Of course it rightfully one of the most iconic episode of the original series Nan performance is outstanding and it an incredibly well told thriller that put modern horror movie to shame It one of the great but is it the best of the best The twist is shocking but to me a great twist should make you reconsider the episode you just watched and see it in a whole new light Besides some clever foreshadowing I missed the first time around you on the side of the angel the knowledge that she already dead doesn really change anything A lot and I mean a LOT of people consider this to be one of the best episode of the entire series but personally I think it just a great episode in a series full of great episode 12 Long Live Walter Jameson The majority of the episode is two men having a conversation and it is a hell of a lot more engaging than that sound The meaning of life and the purpose of death are discussed a one and the same and if that wa the only thing this episode had to offer I still enjoy it Naturally because it The Twilight Zone there more Remember how I gave Elegy a lot of flack for the visuals not aging well Long Live Walter Jameson final scene in which Walter age rapidly in real time is still a mind blowing today a it wa 60 year ago Read up on how they pulled off the effect yourself it something that could have only worked in the day before color TV and CGI 11 The After Hours The Twilight Zone ha a reputation for being a scary show and while it ha many horror element I wouldn call it horror in the traditional sense Having said that the second half of The After Hours is a shining example of what horror should look like Watching Marcia walk through the empty mall in complete silence is one of the tensest scene in the entire show and the shot of all the mannequin stepping out of the shadow is still my favorite visual of the entire series The first act probably isn the most interesting way to set up the second act but the rest of the episode speaks for itself I could talk about the additional little moment that make this episode unique all day but you should really watch this for yourself to get the full experience 10 Nightmare a a Child The most Hitchcockian episode is what kick off our top ten Specifically the tension and pacing of this episode reminds me of Rear Window which is my personal favorite Hitchcock movie Helen and Marky carry the episode really well Helen performance especially is one of the best in the series It one of those episode that you can either take literally see it a a coping mechanism born in Helen mind or really anything you want It one of the scarier episode and in fact it ha one of the most well executed jump scare I ever seen Modern horror movie should take some note from this episode Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ha never been scarier 9 The Purple Testament This episode is quietly brilliant The premise speaks for itself but the episode strength lie in the emotional weight of nearly every scene Moments like Riker leaving photo of his family behind Fitz saying goodbye to Smitty and Fitz silently walking amongst his soldier knowing which of them were going to get it are simply amazing You really get a sense of Fitz burden which of course is a metaphor for the impossible decision that real officer are tasked to make I genuinely want to know how military veteran feel about this episode I love their feedback 8 Where Is Everybody Where is Everybody doe an outstanding job of setting the tone for the rest of the series Earl Holliman wa tasked with carrying 90 of the episode and he take u on a roller coaster of uncertainty The ending is a time capsule of the hope concern and imagination of Americans at the dawn of the Space Age and it even more powerful knowing that we reach the moon just ten year after this episode premiered 7 Judgement Night This is what justice look like in The Twilight Zone The truth behind Lanser situation is revealed in bit and piece allowing the viewer to connect the dot until the final reveal Unlike A Nice Place to Visit this version of hell is a terrifying fate The attack on The Queen of Glasgow is jaw dropping in every sense of the word it among my favorite scene in the series It may seem like I don have a lot to say but it really the type of episode where you can be told too much going into it and I hate to ruin the experience of someone who hasn seen it 6 And When the Sky Was Opened The first men to venture into space weren supposed to come back That a bone chilling premise and the fact that we never find out why the astronaut are disappearing make it even more frightening Their fate is preordained and they are powerless to stop it This episode aired 16 month before Yuri Gagarin became the first man to venture into the final frontier so what we have here is an episode capitalizing on our fear of the unknown Obviously Rod Taylor get a lot of love since he effectively the central character but Jim Hutton and Charles Aidman deserve equal praise This episode will leave you with a lot of question but the fact that it deliberately doesn have many answer is what make it great 5 Time Enough At Last This episode ha a reputation that precedes itself and how could it not The ending the punchline to The Twilight Zone cruelest joke is one of the most legendary in television history Ending aside it still a great episode Burgess Meredith need no introduction his performance is all but unmatched The setting is a desolate wasteland which serf a a metaphor for Bemis loneliness and the set design is an underrated part of the whole experience If you take the ending out you still have a great episode but the ending is what helped this episode remain so iconic after so many year 4 I Shot an Arrow Into the Air Remember Elegy Remember how I said the three astronaut in that episode were completely indistinguishable from each other The three astronaut in I Shot an Arrow Into the Air have their own goal motivation and personality which is really important in an episode where character conflict drive the story In a way the event in this episode don matter a much a the way each character reacts to them and I love that Much like And When the Sky Was Opened the story revolves around the first three men in space what we have here are two story told through the same lens that take radically different direction and I love them both equally I have no doubt that Serling used this episode for inspiration when he wrote Planet of the Apes so if you a fan of that movie you going to love this episode 3 Walking Distance I man enough to admit that I cried during this episode I only 22 but when Martin is telling his younger self to enjoy his youth all I can hear is Rod Serling speaking straight to my soul I watched countless show movie etc about adult wishing they could be kid again but Walking Distance is operating on another level This episode doesn romanticize nostalgia it appreciates it value while also recognizing that pining for your past is no way to spend your present There one scene in particular that best encapsulates this episode and it when Martin try to introduce himself to his parent using his government issued IDs It such an adult way to say that you a child and it almost too brilliant to put into word A real life Martin Sloan would probably have a heart attack knowing how much ice cream soda cost nowadays but the theme of this episode are ageless 2 A Passage For Trumpet All card on the table this wa the hardest episode for me to rank because it my personal favorite Twilight Zone episode I didn want to be that guy who overrated his favorite episode just because of how much I love it I knew that putting it above fan favorite such a Time Enough At Last and The Hitch Hiker would raise eyebrow so I had to be damn sure I knew what I wa doing having it this high Having said all that I genuinely believe that A Passage For Trumpet belongs in the conversation for the best Twilight Zone episode This episode make you feel the full emotional spectrum desperation optimism depression regret hope it all here It not a complex episode story wise but every element wa carefully considered and deliberately executed to achieve perfection Early in the episode we see Joey play his trumpet with what I can only describe a pure passion and that scene add so much emotional weight to his decision to sell his trumpet Moments like that are so easy to perceive but really hard to describe why it work and yet this episode is full of moment like that I can go on without mentioning Jack Klugman whose portrayal of Joey Crown is the single greatest performance of the entire season and maybe even the series With every expression every delivery every upward glance Klugman brought Joey Crown to life I could go on all day about this episode but it the kind of episode you need to see in order to appreciate fully Gene Roddenberry eulogized Rod Serling by saying No one could know Serling or view or read his work without recognizing his deep affection for humanity his sympathetically enthusiastic curiosity about u and his determination to enlarge our horizon by giving u a better understanding of ourselves In my opinion there not one episode that encapsulates that idea better than A Passage For Trumpet 1 The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street As you can probably tell this wa a hard list to write There are 36 episode in the first season An overwhelming majority of them are good plenty are great and a handful are what I consider to be essential viewing I constantly adjusted the order in order to make it a objective a humanly possible but no man is perfect The only thing that wasn in question wa the number one episode because The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street is the one episode that I consider to be genuinely important It is the gold standard of writing timeless social commentary because the theme of this episode are still relevant today By pure coincidence I watched this episode the day before the Mueller Report came out and I genuinely amazed just how much this episode relates to our culture It a brutally honest depiction of how we turn on our fellow man because of fear and prejudice As I wa watching I started to realize just how much I fallen into the trap that this episode wa warning about it one thing for an episode to be technically sound or well acted it another thing for an episode to make me reconsider my perspective It not chilling because some unknown entity will destroy u but because we be the one destroying ourselves and it be fucking easy I didn know he wa my neighbor I have no word,Ranking Every Twilight Zone Episode Season One,I recently took on the Herculean task of ranking every single episode of The Twilight Zone and so far I made it through Season 2 For now my plan is to share my ranking for every season individually and when I finally done I can reveal my overall list with all 156 episode Season 1 is a really strong season There were so many iconic episode that I wa excited to watch for the first time and I found a lot of hidden gem Even the episode I didn think were top 10 material were good and a a whole I think this season set a high bar for the rest of the series Having said that the few episode that I consider bad were REALLY bad and you find out why in just a moment I wanted to make this list a objective a possible so I didn just put my favorite episode at the top just because they my favorite Even then this list is still just my own personal opinion and my idea of a good episode will probably be different than yours In any case I hope you enjoy this list for what it is let me know what you think in the comment 36 The Mighty Casey Well something had to be at the bottom and I actually disappointed with how much this episode sucked I love baseball and I usually love baseball inspired medium but watching this episode felt like watching your favorite team getting blown out by their biggest rival I can forgive the cheesy sound effect for Casey pitch because it still an episode from the 1960 but the idea of a robot needing a heart in order to play baseball is a stretch That same heart causing the robot to lose it competitive drive is actively frustrating There not one element of this episode that I consider good If you want something that feel like the Twilight Zone take on baseball just watch Field of Dreams 35 The Chaser This show is 60 year old and value have changed a lot since then William Shatner saying his girlfriend is treating him like a retarded child in Nick of Time hasn aged well but this is genuinely uncomfortable to watch When I look at Roger all I can see is a creepy incel who date rape a woman and robs her of her humanity I don sympathize with this piece of shit and the twist make me feel horrible for Leela I do like the inclusion of A Daemon get it and if he wa the protagonist then maybe I could get behind this episode The only reason it isn at the bottom is because it actually somewhat well written at least structurally Still this is the only episode that I wanted to turn off halfway through and that unforgivable 34 Elegy Elegy feel more like a parody of The Twilight Zone than an actual episode I don expect special effect from sixty year ago to age perfectly but if the premise relies on our bland and indistinguishable astronaut seeing people frozen in time maybe don include the shot where people are obviously blinking and twitching I don like how the final scene is basically a monologue explaining everything it such a lazy way to deliver information It an incompetent episode but it almost so bad it good That not enough to put it higher on the list but here we are 33 A Nice Place to Visit The idea of your own personal Heaven actually be Hell is interesting but it a premise that is tricky to maintain for a full episode You have to balance the pleasure with the dissatisfaction that come with getting everything you ever wanted and this episode botched the execution It implied that Pip is able to control thing such a the odds of Rocky winning at the casino and the risk of getting caught robbing a bank If you able to ask for condition like this even a semi confident buffoon could make this Hell work for them There wa some fun to be had but that revelation took the sting out of the entire episode 32 The Fever Was this supposed to be scary There a scene where Franklin is talking about the slot machine a if it wa an entity out for his soul and the scene ha an intense air to it Then we see the walking talking slot machine and it just too ridiculous to be scary The rest of the episode is nothing special and Franklin go from being anti gambling to being stark raving mad way too quickly 31 Mirror Image This is the first entry that I think people will disagree with me on because it seems like everybody like this episode except for me The performance receive a lot of praise and it honestly not undeserved Thing is nearly every episode is well acted and the acting in Mirror Image doesn elevate the rest of the episode like Jack Klugman performance in A Passage for Trumpet but I getting ahead of myself Besides the acting I don get the appeal of this episode Doppelgängers are creepy but the story begin and end at a woman see her clone twice The character aren fleshed out enough for me to care about them so I can empathize with Millicent fear or Paul concern The ending is also more confusing than anything ambiguous ending can work really well but this one raise a lot of question that I quite frankly don care to find answer to 30 A World of Difference I really wanted to like A World of Difference partly because it another decently popular episode but mostly because of how much I love The Truman Show This episode just made me want to watch The Truman Show because any good thing I could say about it wa done much better in that movie and many others with a similar premise The body of the episode doesn work for me because Gerry isn developed beyond alcoholic with a bitch wife and the role he loses himself into is barely defined at all credit where it due that last point is actually explored in the episode Also the ending rip off Sixteen Millimeter Shrine 29 Mr Bevis I been negative so far but this is the last episode on the list that I consider bad and even then I don dislike Mr Bevis The problem with this episode is how saccharine it is It feel like how It a Wonderful Life would look if George Bailey wa only mildly annoyed with his life Henry Bevis never wanted to change everything about himself he just had one crummy day that he like to fix At time it a charming love letter to the world goober but too often it feel like the pilot for a show called Leave it to Bevis 28 A World of His Own A writer whose creation come to life is a great idea with a lot of creative direction to go in Unfortunately we only get to see Greg create Mary and an elephant and later destroy his wife The writing is solid enough and I wa never bored watching this episode but it could have gone so much further with it premise I do love Rod cameo at the end it hard to believe that this wa the first time we actually saw his face 27 What You Need By now you probably sensing a theme with my ranking I hate seeing great premise ruined by weak execution What You Need is that concept defined The opening scene with the peddler in the bar is great the middle where Fred try to partner up with him doesn go anywhere and the ending where Pedott say he had to kill Fred because he would have killed him otherwise doesn make any sense If this guy could predict the future why would he give Fred the scissors or the pen in the first place I had so many question coming out of this episode that I felt like I wa being too nitpicky and I hate feeling that way when I talking about a show I otherwise adore 26 Execution Great premise weird execution get it The first act is amazing there very little I would have done differently The second half go completely off the rail with our favorite outlaw going all Encino Man when he venture into modern society The ending wa completely out of place did the burglar need to exist at all As much of a mess a it is this wa actually a really fun episode to watch I just couldn justify putting it any higher on this list It hardly the best episode but it the type of episode that I return to whenever I in the right mood for it 25 Escape Clause I don really care for deal with the devil story because of how predictable they are Escape Clause is about a standard a they come It so standard that I actually having trouble coming up with anything to say about it It competent but not all that creative There are worse episode but at least The Mighty Casey and A Nice Place to Visit gave me something to talk about I don even hate it but I also don like it As Twilight Zone episode go it room temperature tap water 24 Third From the Sun The Twilight Zone ha a knack for social commentary that is still relevant after 60 year Third From the Sun ha lost some of it impact now that we not trying to blow each other to kingdom come but it still an effective episode The episode doe a good job at creating tension and a sense of urgency and the acting wa pretty good What brings the episode down however is the random old man trying to stop our protagonist from escaping I get that the episode needed a villain but it had to be this guy I know nothing about his character and quite frankly I don care enough about him for his inclusion to have any effect on me The message wa probably more effective in 1959 but it pretty good for a time capsule so to speak 23 Mr Denton on Doomsday This is one of those episode that grew on me the more I thought about it I didn like it at first because it doe kind of beat you over the head with it message the night Fate stepped in anyone But I kept thinking about it and the twist is genuinely one of the more heartwarming one I love how giving Denton his life back mean never letting the other kid go down the same road he did It one of the better Western episode of the first two season all thing considered 22 The Last Flight This would have been a great episode if the story wasn entirely delivered through dialogue The story of a pilot traveling through time in order to rectify his cowardice is excellent on it own but I would have rather seen his deed in action rather than hear about them in the past tense I a firm believer of show don tell and this episode tell u a lot more than it show I do enjoy this episode for it story and message but it deserved a better execution 21 Big Tall Wish Let me get something out of the way the scene where Bolie is talking to the promoter is entirely worthless take up way too much screentime and drag the episode down Everything else about The Big Tall Wish is amazing Bolie Jackson is such a great underdog and Henry is the perfect wide eyed child The cinematography when Henry make his wish is so clever yet so simple Bolie telling Henry to stop believing Bolie ving in wish and missing out on his second chance is genuinely heartbreaking It a shame that so much time is dedicated to one meaningless scene because a simple rewrite would have brought this episode into Top 10 territory I just spitballing here but imagine replacing that one scene with a few short scene of Bolie winning fight thanks to Henry wish That would have made the ending that much more powerful 20 The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine We reached the point where I get to start talking about the episode I really love If I wa ranking this solely on how much I liked the episode this would be in the top ten This is one of those episode that might not be a memorable if it wasn for the acting so it a good thing that every actor is at the top of their game especially Ida Lupino a Barbie The Twilight Zone love nostalgia and this episode is a character study of a woman who loses herself to her pursuit of the past After Barbie get chewed out by the director even I started to sympathize with her desire to go back in time I been told that this is really similar to Sunset Boulevard which I haven seen but on it own it definitely an episode worth watching even though I wouldn call it one of the elite episode 19 The Four of Us Are Dying Again this an episode that I enjoy a lot more than my ranking suggests A man who can change his face at will is an awesome concept and the story we got explores that concept really well I love the visual presentation of this episode from the noir aesthetic to the clever way they hide the moment where the actor switch out The only reason it isn higher is because the episode end just a it start getting interesting It one of the few episode that I think would have benefited from Season 4 extended run time I love the episode we got I just wanted more 18 People are Alike All Over Honestly This is a good episode that I don have a lot to say about I take note after finishing each episode and after I watched this one I had a lot of trouble finding anything to write I did enjoy it the twist is awesome and I loved the one line let me know what I dying for but honestly a lot of the episode just felt like filler The only scene I can remember in any sort of detail wa the ending There wa that one Martian woman who feel bad about putting our hero in captivity and if she wa more developed it could have been great It one of those episode I feel like I need to rewatch when I go ahead and make my overall list 17 A Stop at Willoughby I don think there a single fan of the show who dislike this episode myself included It wa actually a personal favorite of Rod Serling himself It a really solid episode that doe so many thing right but it doesn do any one thing better than other Twilight Zone episode Walking Distance is better at romanticizing nostalgia Time Enough at Last ha a better portrayal of a man who want to escape from the world and I could go on but I don want to seem like I piling on this episode because I do really like it James Daly gave a great performance and the final shot is one hell of an ending It a solid 8 in a season that gave u a lot of 9 and 10 which just go to show how strong the competition wa 16 Perchance to Dream Perchance to Dream ha some of the slickest cinematography of the entire season I actually like the aesthetic of the real world a lot more than the dream sequence but the latter scene still look incredible I not the biggest fan of the story but Richard Conte performance allowed me to buy into everything that wa going on It wa all just a dream ending are almost always lame to me but it worked here better than it ha in other show movie I seen 15 One for the Angels Admit it you smiled when Mr Death told Lou you made it The ending is so sweet and iconic that you start to forget just how tight the writing is for the rest of the episode Ed Wynn and Murray Hamilton have outstanding chemistry making Death seem more like a friend than something to be feared It only the second episode which make it even more remarkable considering how well rounded it is 14 The Lonely The Lonely is another episode that could have been perfect with a longer running time but I still love this episode a it is The concept is pure 1950 futurism and the setup before Alicia introduction wa outstanding The final act wa also incredibly well done I could feel Corry connection to Alicia and the dilemma he found himself in I just wish their relationship wa more developed which is exactly why The Lonely deserved a longer runtime or at least made better use of the time it had It wa a great episode that I highly recommend but it wasn a strong a the thirteen episode ahead of it on this list 13 The Hitch Hiker Not gonna lie I enjoyed this episode a lot more when I watched it for the first time a few year ago Is it a great episode Of course it rightfully one of the most iconic episode of the original series Nan performance is outstanding and it an incredibly well told thriller that put modern horror movie to shame It one of the great but is it the best of the best The twist is shocking but to me a great twist should make you reconsider the episode you just watched and see it in a whole new light Besides some clever foreshadowing I missed the first time around you on the side of the angel the knowledge that she already dead doesn really change anything A lot and I mean a LOT of people consider this to be one of the best episode of the entire series but personally I think it just a great episode in a series full of great episode 12 Long Live Walter Jameson The majority of the episode is two men having a conversation and it is a hell of a lot more engaging than that sound The meaning of life and the purpose of death are discussed a one and the same and if that wa the only thing this episode had to offer I still enjoy it Naturally because it The Twilight Zone there more Remember how I gave Elegy a lot of flack for the visuals not aging well Long Live Walter Jameson final scene in which Walter age rapidly in real time is still a mind blowing today a it wa 60 year ago Read up on how they pulled off the effect yourself it something that could have only worked in the day before color TV and CGI 11 The After Hours The Twilight Zone ha a reputation for being a scary show and while it ha many horror element I wouldn call it horror in the traditional sense Having said that the second half of The After Hours is a shining example of what horror should look like Watching Marcia walk through the empty mall in complete silence is one of the tensest scene in the entire show and the shot of all the mannequin stepping out of the shadow is still my favorite visual of the entire series The first act probably isn the most interesting way to set up the second act but the rest of the episode speaks for itself I could talk about the additional little moment that make this episode unique all day but you should really watch this for yourself to get the full experience 10 Nightmare a a Child The most Hitchcockian episode is what kick off our top ten Specifically the tension and pacing of this episode reminds me of Rear Window which is my personal favorite Hitchcock movie Helen and Marky carry the episode really well Helen performance especially is one of the best in the series It one of those episode that you can either take literally see it a a coping mechanism born in Helen mind or really anything you want It one of the scarier episode and in fact it ha one of the most well executed jump scare I ever seen Modern horror movie should take some note from this episode Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ha never been scarier 9 The Purple Testament This episode is quietly brilliant The premise speaks for itself but the episode strength lie in the emotional weight of nearly every scene Moments like Riker leaving photo of his family behind Fitz saying goodbye to Smitty and Fitz silently walking amongst his soldier knowing which of them were going to get it are simply amazing You really get a sense of Fitz burden which of course is a metaphor for the impossible decision that real officer are tasked to make I genuinely want to know how military veteran feel about this episode I love their feedback 8 Where Is Everybody Where is Everybody doe an outstanding job of setting the tone for the rest of the series Earl Holliman wa tasked with carrying 90 of the episode and he take u on a roller coaster of uncertainty The ending is a time capsule of the hope concern and imagination of Americans at the dawn of the Space Age and it even more powerful knowing that we reach the moon just ten year after this episode premiered 7 Judgement Night This is what justice look like in The Twilight Zone The truth behind Lanser situation is revealed in bit and piece allowing the viewer to connect the dot until the final reveal Unlike A Nice Place to Visit this version of hell is a terrifying fate The attack on The Queen of Glasgow is jaw dropping in every sense of the word it among my favorite scene in the series It may seem like I don have a lot to say but it really the type of episode where you can be told too much going into it and I hate to ruin the experience of someone who hasn seen it 6 And When the Sky Was Opened The first men to venture into space weren supposed to come back That a bone chilling premise and the fact that we never find out why the astronaut are disappearing make it even more frightening Their fate is preordained and they are powerless to stop it This episode aired 16 month before Yuri Gagarin became the first man to venture into the final frontier so what we have here is an episode capitalizing on our fear of the unknown Obviously Rod Taylor get a lot of love since he effectively the central character but Jim Hutton and Charles Aidman deserve equal praise This episode will leave you with a lot of question but the fact that it deliberately doesn have many answer is what make it great 5 Time Enough At Last This episode ha a reputation that precedes itself and how could it not The ending the punchline to The Twilight Zone cruelest joke is one of the most legendary in television history Ending aside it still a great episode Burgess Meredith need no introduction his performance is all but unmatched The setting is a desolate wasteland which serf a a metaphor for Bemis loneliness and the set design is an underrated part of the whole experience If you take the ending out you still have a great episode but the ending is what helped this episode remain so iconic after so many year 4 I Shot an Arrow Into the Air Remember Elegy Remember how I said the three astronaut in that episode were completely indistinguishable from each other The three astronaut in I Shot an Arrow Into the Air have their own goal motivation and personality which is really important in an episode where character conflict drive the story In a way the event in this episode don matter a much a the way each character reacts to them and I love that Much like And When the Sky Was Opened the story revolves around the first three men in space what we have here are two story told through the same lens that take radically different direction and I love them both equally I have no doubt that Serling used this episode for inspiration when he wrote Planet of the Apes so if you a fan of that movie you going to love this episode 3 Walking Distance I man enough to admit that I cried during this episode I only 22 but when Martin is telling his younger self to enjoy his youth all I can hear is Rod Serling speaking straight to my soul I watched countless show movie etc about adult wishing they could be kid again but Walking Distance is operating on another level This episode doesn romanticize nostalgia it appreciates it value while also recognizing that pining for your past is no way to spend your present There one scene in particular that best encapsulates this episode and it when Martin try to introduce himself to his parent using his government issued IDs It such an adult way to say that you a child and it almost too brilliant to put into word A real life Martin Sloan would probably have a heart attack knowing how much ice cream soda cost nowadays but the theme of this episode are ageless 2 A Passage For Trumpet All card on the table this wa the hardest episode for me to rank because it my personal favorite Twilight Zone episode I didn want to be that guy who overrated his favorite episode just because of how much I love it I knew that putting it above fan favorite such a Time Enough At Last and The Hitch Hiker would raise eyebrow so I had to be damn sure I knew what I wa doing having it this high Having said all that I genuinely believe that A Passage For Trumpet belongs in the conversation for the best Twilight Zone episode This episode make you feel the full emotional spectrum desperation optimism depression regret hope it all here It not a complex episode story wise but every element wa

313,nulldrone,1,Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Martha happy birthday to you Honey blow out the candle But don forget to make a wish Mike amp x200B Like many episode of 20 Twilight Zone I really like the idea this one is playing with I don think any other iteration of the Twilight Zone would have the stone a in red space hulkstones to tell story like this which put 20 Twilight Zone in a unique position This might be a weird comparison but The Fugitive is a pretty silly episode of 60 Twilight Zone where Jenny aunt action could be interpreted a child abuse It relatively understated and put on the backburner for this wacky space king plot and is mostly used to get the audience to empathize with Jenny not unlike Rapunzel cruel upbringing And like The Fugitive Not All Men also ha a weird sense of humor and the predilection of juxtaposing serious issue with something fantastic and absurd I think this episode would been stronger if it played the whole hulkstone epidemic thing a little more seriously because half of the time it want to discus serious social issue and the other time it content with being a popcorn thriller To this episode credit I think it the funniest episode of 20 Twilight Zone yet but it come at the cost of it message which if you ask me is a real shame The Fugitive clearly wasn meant to be this deep dive on the psychological effect of child abuse but both episode suffer from being just too darn silly for their own good While I like this episode better than The Fugitive overall the way that it want to be taken seriously make it more muddled and ultimately wasted potential Almost a wasted a a 15 year old snorting empty shell of hulkstone in a dumpster behind Eddies Eat enough dust and you be cryin out for the Twilight Zone amp x200B The sequence where Dylan play keep away with the hulkstone is really clever because it not only misdirects the audience into thinking there something sinister behind the hulkstone but also get u to question whether it affect both men and woman It also provides a cute awkward moment between the two that build u up for when thing suddenly stop going so well You can see the writer constructing their thesis what could be read a a cute moment between the two could be seen a Dylan being patronizing The way he keep emphasizing that their love is cosmic also support this And y know what I like this twist This whole gotcha there no supernatural element and it wa mankind internal darkness all along turn is one that I can always get behind The thing is it not believable It good to have Dylan a a case study It good to namedrop placebo But am I really supposed to believe that an ordinary meteor shower is gonna get ton of men to become engorged with forehead vein red eye and go full Mad Max Maybe if they downplayed it to a violent bar incident a stalker and Mike get a little too intense The theory that the hulkstones are causing the hulk is just a random flimsy suggestion from Annie anyways maybe if they had a group of woman concluding this or some kind of sciencey news program the subversion would have more impact This episode want to roll around in it violent aggro apocalypse but it can connect back to the present When nerdy bos guy postulate that it a hormonal thing or a chromosomal interaction I just sitting here rolling my eye And I get where they coming from Not all men are angry hyper violent hulk Duh When you hear incident of men committing heinous crime it reflects poorly on all men and each individual ultimately ha a choice in who they want to be While this episode is a little silly if you take it literally it clearly meant to be allegorical albeit indulgent at time This may be one of those oops all metaphor case and I totally get why people would be offended It insulting to imply that men are biologically inclined to be these Saturday Morning hulk that have to suppress this inner bloodlust Whenever I analyze medium I try to give the author the benefit of the doubt so I choose to believe that this isn blatant misandry from the writer part Your guess is a good a mine There a peculiar scene at the beginning that I thought wa really neat So Annie bos tell her that she gonna have to work with Dylan and we cut to this surreal yoga class where Annie is instructed to do a warrior pose This could be seen a Annie trying to put on a brave face but I read it a a greater overarching message about how to respond to sexual harassment one of the opening shot of the episode show The Art of War which carves some neat subtext into the episode The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting when Martha attempt to use the hulkstone to she hulk out it doesn work Victims of sexual abuse won always be able to stop abuser through physical or mental strength alone a that playing to the power dynamic imposed by the abuser While this episode doesn explicitly propose a solution Annie confession to her sister invokes the MeToo movement and the power of reaching out to others and group support That and a goddamned frying pan to the head See what I mean when I say this episode ha tonal problem I also like that it brought up that men can be victim of sexual abuse too and it prevalence among LGBT relationship I wonder if that why the ship named Achilles These are topic that are often overlooked and I glad that they were touched upon here A couple of minor nitpicks Annie wake up in the morning to see that her left arm is bruised If you rewind a little bit you see Dylan wa clutching to her right arm Just an oversight I think Also that brief sequence with the meteoroid zipping around wa peak cheese Not that that a deal breaker I like how the cheese added to the easygoing atmosphere it had going on I probably don need to say this at this point but the directing and cast were spot on a usual Really liked the lighting in this one Taissa Farmiga doe an excellent job at getting the audience to go through what she feeling and I let Ike Barinholtz slice me up like a birthday cake any day Not surprised that scene became promotional trailer fodder amp x200B Not All Men smash two wildly different tone together with mixed result I think it pretty effective at delivering each of those tone like if this episode wa split into two little standard length episode they would be some pretty good episode As a whole it clunky and uneven but I be lying if I said I didn have a fun time overall Again the way the twist wa set up and executed wa half baked and the more I got through the episode the more I figured the ending would probably be unsatisfying Also this is one of their better us of the TV MA rating giving u some gratuitous as violence and an intimately spooky cake scene It want to have it spooky cake and eat it too I haven read any review but I have a feeling this episode gonna get a lot of negative press At least I get to hang onto those unpopular opinion that I love so much Somebody reading this review who didn like the episode might think I being too charitable and even for episode I don like like The Fugitive spoiler I feel it generally more productive a a reviewer to strive for understanding than just trashing on something Trashing on stuff is fun but it just empty calorie at the end of the day It not gonna get you that fiber and HDL Yes we still hung up on the cake thing So the other reason why I haven been pumping out weekly review for 20 Twilight Zone is that I tend to feel pretty lukewarm towards the series a a whole It always hard to write for thing I don have much of an opinion on and I glad that an episode like this exists it not perfect but it got a strong mixed reaction from me And I take a strong mixed reaction over something unmemorable any day Fear before kicker never been sicker,The Groan Zone Not All Men Review,Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Martha happy birthday to you Honey blow out the candle But

epidemic of organized murder of woman by men Some scientist suspect a biological cause for this sexually selective insanity selected observation of lab animal indicate that the normal male sexual urge

woman When the religion initially arises prior to the organized murder little is done to stop the ideology spread nor are their action of evicting woman from the area the men control prevented Alan

pointing to this a a shortcoming in the plot I believe it an intentional component of the show if not the main point You meant to ask yourself why people look the other way when extreme happen in

394,Logilly_12,1,Spoilers just fyi Each week after I watch a new episode I bump into an article or post saying that the episode made no sense wa foolish poorly written and I honestly think people are missing the point I think people are looking at the episode only skin deep and are missing what Peele is actually trying to say Peele in all of his writing directing ha a TON of hidden meaning Just look at Get Out and Us he ha a surface deep story but there so much more he want the audience to figure out for themselves Let look at each episode so far Wunderkind On the surface it a silly story of a kid getting elected president but it really a thinly vailed criticism of Trump He literally used line close to what Trump ha said If you not with me it treason and his lack of performance in debate to display his childish nature If you rewatch and think of Oliver not a a kid but a the mind of the President it make it so much better A Traveler On the surface it just a poorly done Alien invasion but the theme of the episode is about lying I happened to be reading the Mueller Report when this episode aired and the tactic A Traveler us is so similar to how Russian interfered with the election through fake news and social medium A Traveler lied about everything to divide everyone and cause mistrust allowing them to invade or interfere Rewind This one might be the most clear message even from the surface being vigilant about biased police help keep them in check You could dive further by saying that the rewind is representing it happening over and over in society but I think Peele wa pretty clear on this one Nightmare at 30k ft From what I seen this is the most liked episode but even it ha a small deeper meaning beyond just a fun retelling of a classic episode Justin is a white guy who first look at Sikhs then Russians a potential problem when really the bad guy wa the white guy right beside him Peele wa hiding a message about domestic terrorism in the episode we accuse everyone else but ignore the threat here The Comedian I think this episode is Peele most personal He used to be just a comedian but a his game grew he had to give more and more of himself to the point that between the Twilight Zone and his film he probably ha very little personal time with his wife and son so he probably feel like he had to give them up for his fame The joke aren supposed to be funny in it they supposed to be sacrifice for fame With all this said I do understand the criticism people are going to like what they like and dislike what they don Yes some episode have been too long I seen the too political argument which is kinda dumb because Twilight Zone always ha been but I think a lot of the criticism is coming from people who haven tried to figure out what Peele is trying to say in the episode I think he honestly doing a great job of tackling modern concern without having to walk out at the end and say this episode wa about racism Rod Serling wrote a lot of

403,Lowkey_HatingThis,1,So I had been watching the TZ ever since I wa about 10 I wait all year to DVR sy fy New year marathon I loved every episode sure some were not a good or classic but they were all interesting idea and every episode I never once questioned that I wa in the twilight zone and that these character were victim of it The new series I sorry I really wanted to enjoy it I really wanted to but it just is so all over the place and weak in it writing it not even funny I won discus the first two episode I watched those a few week ago and haven rewatched since so it wouldn be fair But I will discus episode 3 5 Episode 3 Surprisingly the episode with the least original idea device that can rewind time is actually the most original of the three because it isn just relying on the idea of famous episode from the original series The writing in this episode wa the strongest but I felt like the dialogue wa a little too on the nose But I wa very excited to see how this would end up Then the second half came and god wa it awful I understand what the message and meaning are behind it but it all over the place It felt like they wrote 70 of the episode realized they weren close to wrapping it up and just decided to end it with that scene The main character wa speaking like no one ever would in real life it wa so on the nose and corny And it couldn even keep it own message straight at first the main character go off about how their love will over come the fear but then later she claim she will always live in fear So what the message here minority will over come police brutality and racism or that police brutality and racism are so bad they will always have to live in fear Not only that but it really blew it load here and ha basically erased any chance to make another episode with theme of police brutality and police racism like this If they would kept it to just the one cop and had him confront them at the end it might been better But it had to be all no this one person is gonna show everyone that every cop is weak and racist because reason They put all the chip in on this one and it felt too forced and spoon fed like the episode wa saying hey in case you didn get the message this is a problem in our society At this point it stopped feeling like a TZ episode and started feeling like a poorly written political message The original series had alot of episode with the same political message so many about the cold war but it wa always do e through personal character to character interaction which is what this episode went for and then failed to do in the closer Episode 4 So did this one just have a different writer writing every 10 minute Holy moly it wa so hard to keep up with it at point The traveler wa just an odd as character they tried to give him this creepy mysterious aura but kinda wasted it by making his first 15 minute out to be some ecentric YouTube blogger also the last two episode felt like they were heavily plugging YouTube Then once he pardoned it literally is just the monster are due on Maple Street The writer knew exactly how bad they were copying that idea which is why they tried to make Yuka the central figure making the opening and closing narration about her knack for uncovering the mysterious in what way The whole episode she is no more remarkable than any other character the whole theme about what she want for Christmas and wanting to be in charge made no sense because her character just never reacted to any of it It further try to distance itself from TMADOMS by making the alien actually invade at the end but why even go through all the trouble of turning people against themselves if you just invade anyways You could literally just invade and knock out the power grid TMADOMS ended with the alien simply observing making minor adjustment and never revealing their purpose This episode tried to copy the magic that episode had and apply it McCarthy era paranoia message onto our fake news era but fell flat in it delivery with yet another episode of weak writing and an even weaker finish that felt like the writer forgot how much time wa left in the episode and just pushed the ending when they could cut out half the filler of the first half hour to make room for it Episode 5 Again it a copy of It a good life BUT I actually like the direction it took with adapting this classic idea Instead of a mentally god like child terrorizing a town it a manipulative child terrorizing the US government This core idea wa interesting and lead to some nice scene but damn this show cannot write character motivation to save it life It all so on the nose the campaign manager want to help Oliver because he really belief in his message he connects with people It trying to highlight how the American public is stupid because it would rather elect someone who seems genuine rather than a politician Yes this episode is trying to make fun of Donald Trump comparing him to a spoiled child But it fails miserably because they make Oliver a good president He keep all his promise his approval rating are high everyone love him So what the message here We should elect people like that And it also just can decide on what it want to be You have human moment like the campaign manager sitting at the bar talking about how he really believed in oliver Then you have stupid absorbed shit oliver literally changing the lighting of the room to make it more ominous btw this is so lazy I can believe they did it What director ha to have a character announce the change of lightning to make something ominous and then the secret service agent just shoot him for no reason he line 4 foot away from Oliver hand out and they draw their gun before Oliver even finish his sentence And that ending Wow the worst twist of them all It a stupid call back to a law that wa brought up a few time in the episode It make you go oh haha yeah he doesn want old doctor I get it where if you were to watch It a good life the episode this is trying to parody that ending just make you go Jesus Christ And why is that well that brings me to the final point Because it genuine It ha genuine human interaction that serve a allegory for well developed political message That what the original TZ had it had layer to it This new series is uninspired sloppy and lacking ant nuance at all It very disappointing it try to mask it plot hole and outlandish character motivation behind the idea that it the twilight zone thing are wacky here Overall the new series is a wacky le inspired Black mirror and that just the worst blow to rod serling legacy I can think of I will continue to watch and have high hope the next episode is the first space one and I always loved those original TZ episode but so far I can see

406,inspiteofMM,1,Ending 1 I honestly thought the twist of this episode wa going to be that the son wa actually a murder and the cop recognized him in the diner The cop wasnt pursuing them because he wa racist he wa pursuing them because the son wa an actual dangerous criminal and the mom didnt know it And it would have been u the audience that wa the racist one in assuming that the cop wa pursuing them because he wa racist when in actuality he wa just doing his job The commentary of the episode would have been how racist u the audience wa because we were making all kind of assumption about the creator of the show amp x200B Ending 2 The mom go very far back in time and witness what happens to the cop wife That she wa shot and killed by an african american man that happens to look a lot like her son And this is the source of the cop reason for pursuing them all this time Not because he racist but because the son look like his wife murderer And maybe she us the camera to help the cop come to term with his wife passing and let go of the past amp x200B Ending 3 All the interaction with the cop were actually legit and the camera prof it by showing u the future and what would have happened if the cop didnt intervene The time the cop pull them over the first time for speeding and using a hand held device we see that if the cop didnt pull them over they would have crashed into another car When the cop asks them to move their car because it wa blocking the road we see that 1 minute later there wa another car on the highway that lost it brake and ha to use that road to safely slow down and stop But because the mom car wa blocking the road the other car crash into them When the cop go to the hotel it turn out that there wa a domestic disturbance the room nextdoor that break out into a fight When the cop approach the mom in the diner parking lot it turn out that someone had made a prank call and called in that the mom car wa stolen and the cop wa just investigating And when the cop stop them after they climb out of the sewer and are heading for the college it turn out that the mom brother actually had a bomb strapped to himself and wa going to blow up the school anyway I bet someone else can come up with better reason the point is to illustrate that the cop could have been the good guy all along amp x200B Ending 4 It wa always the son fate to be accidentally shot by that cop Not because he racist or anything but just simply a pure accident And each time she rewinded the camera and tried to prevent it fate kept on twisting thing to undo her interference making thing a little more messed up then what would have happened in the original timeline In the son own word everything thats supposed to happen happens Its all been predetermined since the big bang You cant change fate amp x200B Anyway these are just a few that I came up with off the tip of my head All of these feel more Twilight Zone y to me What do you guy think How would you have ended it Almost anything would have been better then what we got,Spoilers A Few Better Endings to episode 3 Replay,Ending 1 I honestly thought the twist of this episode wa going to be that the son wa actually a murder and the cop recognized him in the diner The cop wasnt pursuing them because he wa racist he wa pursuing them because the son wa an actual dangerous criminal and the mom didnt know it And it would have been u the audience that wa the racist one in assuming that the cop wa pursuing them because he wa racist when in actuality he wa just doing his job The commentary of the episode would have been how racist u the audience wa because we were making all kind of assumption about the creator of the show amp x200B Ending 2 The mom go very far back in time and witness what happens to the cop wife That she wa shot and killed by an african american man that happens to look a lot like her son And this is the source of the cop reason for pursuing them all this time Not because he racist but because the son look like his wife murderer And maybe she us the camera to help the cop come to term with his wife passing and let go of the past amp x200B Ending 3 All the interaction with the cop were actually legit and the camera prof it by showing u the future and what would have happened if the cop didnt intervene The time the cop pull them over the first time for speeding and using a hand held device we see that if the cop didnt pull them over they would have crashed into another car When the cop asks them to move their car because it wa blocking the road we see that 1 minute

441,nulldrone,1,Little boy little boy with their head full up with dream And when do they find out Frances when do they suddenly find out that there ain any magic When doe somebody push their face down on a sidewalk and say to them Hey little boy it concrete That what the world is made out of concrete When do they find out that you can wish your life away Bolie Jackson People have a strange penchant for childhood innocence If show like Kids Say the Darndest Things aren evidence enough there the perpetuation of myth like Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy and pelican midwife I guess it endearing and nostalgic in a way like when it start raining and a kid remark how the sky peeing again When someone still learning about the world you get a vicarious sense of exploration and newness Maybe you just want them to revel in the idea of magic before life stomp it out of them To take in a world where anything is possible There probably better way to do this than flat out lying but it understandable After all a lot of these tradition function a a rite of passage of sort Of course this is trivial in a universe where magic doe exist It for that reason that translating this episode message to the real world can be tricky and why many people find this episode overly sentimental After all magic isn real and if so certainly not a spookerific a your favorite TV show If this were a real boxing match Bolie wouldn tve won because he believed in magic Twilight Zone ha a fondness for childlike wonder a episode like Mr Bevis and Kick the Can show But understandably magic is meant to be allegorical it may be substituting for a general sense of wonder religious faith what have you Even if magic isn real believing is very real and something to be treasured Believing is how you get show like the Twilight Zone amp x200B You might walk away going C mon Bolie why can you just believe All you had to do wa Bolie I really feel for Bolie When you grow up in an environment where you constantly knocked down it ha a big impact on your outlook on life And sure he could lie but deep down he know he doesn believe He can Believing can be the hardest thing ever And there clearly some cognitive dissonance going on Everybody tell Bolie that he wa never down and totally clobbered the great Consiglio and Bolie ha no choice but to smile and take their word for it Bolie doesn seem to have the greatest self esteem but he belief he won this on his own He strike me a the kind of guy who hasn had a lot of win He need this And that a terribly ironic power Henry wields Imagine having the power to wish anything but it only work if people believe in it magic Reminds me of Cassandra cursed clairvoyance It implied that Frances belief in Henry wish and there some fascinating subtext

reinforces Bolie negative self image but the way it escalates leaf little impact Perhaps this episode biting off a little more than it can chew Ultimately it serf to remind u that there no way that Bolie gonna win the fight I might liked it more if they left some ambiguity to get the audience to feel hopeful for Bolie It also suggests some of Bolie pain is self inflicted And no Bolie you don need to remind u how Henry gonna wish you out of this one We get it The way the crowd scene is shot is rather interesting with still between a bunch of nervous hand Clearly they don have enough extra to fill a stadium so they have to go with this quirky approach It a little stilted but I find it a more powerful way of creating tension than just sweeping through a bunch of people hootin and hollerin It also reminds u of Bolie own busted hand I would liked it better if we didn see any of the crowd face that toothpick guy is rather distracting It cool how Henry mimicking some boxing move showing how these large televised event can affect people and showing how he rapt with focus It also reinforces how Bolie is a role model for Henry We get some more interesting shot a the camera crumples to the floor creating a unique perspective and getting u to fall with Bolie Apparently a later shot wa taken by filming upward underneath some glass This wa directed by Ron Winston who also did a fantastic job with The Monsters are Due on Maple Street and the le memorable Stopover in a Quiet Town It also worth noting that Jerry Goldsmith come in with an original score with some harmonica solo I mean we all know how powerful harmonica are This episode play with some familiar concept but pack powerful idea and executes them with a unique flair It make for a very distinct viewing experience even for the Twilight Zone We see Henry tending to some rabbit on the roof According to Wikipedia they symbolize vitality and resurrection so this is technically an Easter review happy zombie jesus day which might signify how Bolie rejuvenation It a little strange that Henry would have pet rabbit given his speculative financial situation perhaps he big tall wished for those too Reminds me of Of Mice and Men But I have to admit this scene work a lot better than it would in Henry room so I can work with it It also show Henry in a more parental role basically being forced to admit the truth He seems pretty guilty about it too like he staged the fight and he getting called out on it When Henry silently confirms Bolie suspicion Bolie start wringing Henry by the shoulder to some extent Bolie is aware that he didn deserve the win and it eating him up inside And up next is the most gut wrenching scene I get choked up every time When Bolie professes that he deserved the win you can see the nervousness in his eye he trying to convince himself that he deserved to win that he not a ha been that he worth something Even when he talk to Henry later he come up with excuse blaming the loss on his busted knuckle And a a result Bolie not only loses the match but also shake Henry faith It hard not to feel a tinge of sadness a you watch Henry childhood die a little But this isn because Henry experience the harshness of reality first hand rather he see what the harshness of reality can do to a person and how it can carve somebody with so little faith that they defeat themselves Life go on Bolie career a a boxer might be over but he still ha the rest of his life ahead of him and they gonna go to a hockey game and get frosty chocolate milkshake Even in time of disillusionment and hopelessness you still have love and I think that really sweet Cheesy but earned Despite criticism of sentimentality I think this is low key one of the saddest episode in the entire series These criticism probably come from the idea that if you wish hard enough for something it come true Idealistic yes but I choose to interpret it more a having self confidence and optimism As much a I hate to admit it there is power in positive thinking Even if you interpret Henry wish a magic or religious faith what wrong with telling people to believe in a better future Sometimes that all people have And this episode doesn condemn Bolie for his lack of belief it just point out that rampant pessimism can lead to a self fulfilling prophecy By all account he should lost that fight and he know it And rather than being sanctimonious or didactic this episode is earnest and admits that some people are dealt a bad hand in life and it affect the way they think And sometimes all you can do is be loving and supportive I probably be remiss if I didn say something about the cast they did great Ivan Dixon ha a good performance where he capture Bolie fury in a understated way while maintaining some degree of lightheartedness Stephen Perry doe well a a child actor lending that quiet intensity that every kid in the Twilight Zone seems to have And their sweet friendship balance the overwhelming sense of brutality and despair that box this episode This episode may be simple at it core but it hit you with the ol one two Because it painfully obvious Henry wish is going to work It obvious the first time he say it it obvious the second time it obvious when Frances affirms it and it obvious when Bolie reminds u before the fight And this whole time I thinking what the twist gonna be Will the wish backfire in an exceedingly ironic fashion No it take a fantastic concept and resolve it in a grounded way It seems like it just going through the motion until about 2 3rds through when it hit you with that strong emotional scene I find this episode very compelling It might not resonate with others a much but it still a strong episode in it own right and tends to be overlooked Highly recommend,The Groan Zone The Big Tall Wish Review,Little boy little boy with their head full up with dream And when do they find out Frances when do they suddenly find out that there ain any magic When doe somebody push their face down on a sidewalk and say to them Hey little boy it concrete That what the world is made out of concrete When do they find out that you can wish your life away Bolie Jackson People have a strange penchant for childhood innocence If show like Kids Say the Darndest Things aren evidence enough there the perpetuation of myth like Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy and pelican midwife I guess it endearing and nostalgic in a way like when it start raining and a kid remark how the sky peeing again When someone still learning about the world you get a vicarious sense of exploration and newness Maybe you just want them to revel in the idea of magic before life stomp it out of them To take in a world where anything is possible There probably better way to do this than flat out lying but it understandable After all a lot of these tradition function a a rite of passage of sort Of course this is trivial in a universe where magic doe exist It for that reason that translating this episode message to the real world can be tricky and why many people find this episode overly sentimental After all magic isn real and if so certainly not a spookerific a your favorite TV show If this were a real boxing match Bolie wouldn tve won because he believed in magic Twilight Zone ha a fondness for childlike wonder a episode like Mr Bevis and Kick the Can show But understandably magic is meant to be allegorical it may be substituting for a general sense of wonder religious faith what have you Even if magic isn real believing is very real and something to be treasured Believing is how you get show like the Twilight Zone amp x200B You might walk away going C mon Bolie why can you just believe All you had to do wa Bolie I really feel for Bolie When you grow up in an environment where you constantly knocked down it ha a big impact on your outlook on life And sure he could lie but deep down he know he doesn believe He can Believing can be the hardest thing ever And there clearly some cognitive dissonance going on Everybody tell Bolie that he wa never down and totally clobbered the great Consiglio and Bolie ha no choice but to smile and take their word for it Bolie doesn seem to have the greatest self esteem but he belief he won this on his own He strike me a the kind of guy who hasn had a lot of win He need this And that a terribly ironic power Henry wields Imagine having the power to wish anything but it only work if people believe in it magic Reminds me of Cassandra cursed clairvoyance It implied that Frances belief in Henry wish and there some fascinating subtext behind Henry other big tall wish the fact that he us his strongest magick to scrape together rent money suggests that they aren very well off Frances likely struggle to pay

447,RadioGhibli,1,Like many of you I grew up on the Twilight Zone My mother actually watched them growing up in the 60 and would tell me Twilight Zone episode for bed time story when I wa a child And when I wa old enough I bought all the DVDs back when they were the 5 episode volume While I am only 31 I absolutely adore the series and have seen every episode hundred of time I even thought the 80 version wa criminally underrated it had some dud but it also had some incredible gem And while the 00s reboot wa mostly bad I still had been craving the series to make a return So when I heard Jordan Peele wa going to relaunch the series I wa beyond ecstatic I love Peele and it just felt like the right time for the Twilight Zone to finally come back But my god ha this been one big let down after the next I going to try to break down the issue I have with it in point The episode length is a detriment When the original series went with the hour format in Season 4 it wa definitely a mixed bag I would say the majority of the episode were worse for it The latest reboot suffers the same issue The very first episode The Comedian actually had an interesting premise But it wa 100 unpleasant to watch given how long the thing dragged out So far I felt this way about all the episode where I either feel they go on too long or the writer squander the time they have But these would be much better in the shorter format Especially since the writer seem to want to overtly hammer the message of the episode over and over the length just make it redundant The new series completely miss the spirit of the original with how it tackled social political subject One of the thing I keep seeing people say to defend the reboot is that the original talked about poltiics So clearly you havent seen the original While it true the original series talked about social political issue and even had episode that reflected the time the issue is not that it poltiical it the way the new series talk about these issue The orignal used sci fi fantasy to tell a story hence taking u to another dimension which then had store that reflected issue of the day The writing wa nuanced and subtle Which then made the revelation all the more shocking and horrifying because you realized that in the real world thing like that are actually happening and isnt so different from the dimension you were taken to The new series hit you over the head and preaches with activist style writing and isnt subtle at all The social poltical stuff drive the story and the twilight zone sci fi stuff take a back seat Even if you agree with the politics of the show it really poorly done The original wanted everyone to watch it including the people or idea it wa critical of This is related to the section above but latest reboot take the modern you are either with u or you are the enemy attitude of modern activism The first episode literally open with a 3 min rant on Gun Control and how one side is crazy and stupid While the other side is clearly the good guy and sane Completely ignoring the fact that many gun owner actually want regulation And that there is a much more complicated reason for why some beleive we should have gun instead the episode boil it down to hur dur muh right Point being the orignal series would have wanted gun owner to watch it and through a story it would try to convince them to change their mind The new series just straight up attack people and insult them if they arent on the right side of thing And IMO this is a major failure of the new series And even if you agree politically socially so you are on the side of the show it just circle jerking yeah fuck the other side kind of writing and that is really below what the series should be about I loved the original because it wa draw people into the story and everyone could relate to it And if you were someone that didn agree with the politics of the show it would actually make you think why you might be wrong The writing is really messy sloppy The latest episode The Traveler is a perfect example of this The fact that it ha 50 min to tell it story and yet it still seems to be that muddled confusing is amazing The story itself make sense If you step back it easy to get But understanding the character motivation and the little detail of what is going on is a damn mess By the end of the episode it feel abrupt and you dont really care why the two character are doing what they are doing There is such a big disconnect While the other episode don feel a sloppy writing wise they all suffer the same issue of feeling overwritten Rewind is just straight up awful The first 20 min of the episode had me glued to my seat The way they used the rewind mechanic made you truly feel the fear that a minority feel in this country afraid of the police Its a never ending hell because you feel like no matter what you do you are always on edge afraid However the episode quickly turn into a cartoon by making the racist cop a terminator like presence The guy just show up wherever whenever The reason for him escalating dont make sense And again I get there are example of cop escalating over small thing in the real world But the show ha that moment where they humanize the cop when the mother talk to him Only for a second later for him to turn into the Terminator out for blood It clashed tone wise I also feel it cheapens racism One of the horror of racism is that racist people are human We have to accept this Its a mistake to paint horrible people who do abhorrent thing a this magical evil It take away from the motivation of why they do what they do It take away the enviroment that shaped them The episode then crescendo into them literally using a modern take Underground Railroad system and then having a stand off between an entire university and a bunch of racist Cops Again the concept itself isnt bad The way it executed wa completely hamfisted and cringe There were so many way that episode could have been done in the spirit of the orignal series and it would have actually been more powerful then the faux empowerment of the episode In conclusion so far this new reboot ha been a big let down The cinematography is absolutely stunning The acting for the most part is brilliant This show ha everything going for it But so far I found the vast majority of the episode to be unpleasant or riddled with glaring flaw The Travler should have been a slam dunk The setting wa brilliant Again it looked gorgeous Steven Yeun wa incredibly disturbing And yet the whole thing wa just wasted A muddled mess They couldnt even do a monster of the week style episode right And that really make me think this series is going to continue to be mediocre And that suck so bad,I really don like the new series,Like many of you I grew up on the Twilight Zone My mother actually watched them growing up in the 60 and would tell me Twilight Zone episode for bed time story when I wa a child And when I wa old enough I

absolutely stunning The acting for the most part is brilliant This show ha everything going for it But so far I found the vast majority of the episode to be unpleasant or riddled with glaring flaw The Travler should have been a slam dunk The setting wa brilliant Again it looked gorgeous Steven Yeun wa incredibly disturbing And yet the whole thing wa just wasted A muddled mess They couldnt even do a monster of the week style episode right And that really make me think this series is going to continue to be mediocre And that suck so badI really don like the new series

489,JuliusHibbert,1,I wanted to contribute my 4 major point to improve this incarnation of the show Before I get into it I want to say I really happy you have brought it back This post isn meant to castigate you clearly putting a lot of effort and I a no one As a fan I hope to be helpful and supportive giving my opinion constructively is the most I can do on that front I fully recognize how difficult it must be to reboot a classic TV show Please don be discouraged because watching it ha been a highpoint of my week and I enjoyed the show besides a few minor quibble complaint Here are 4 major point I think can improve the show Fair warning there are a few small spoiler about the new series ahead 1 The Narration isn just a quirky feature it serf a function The opening and closing narration are essential element of the show It often feel like the TZ reboots have treated the narration portion a an aside or a low effort box to tick before moving on the story As I see it the intro outro purpose is two fold A The intro narration often give u a summation of the character inner world and other perspective we may not have been privy to seeing It characterizes their biggest flaw and their greatest triumph wish and aspiration This set the stage and involves u a an active participant in the show If this is skipped it at great detriment to the viewer B The closing narration often provides u with insight It delivers a message commentary or point toward something we should look for in ourselves or in society It show u that thing we just watched wa a parable and sometimes in 4 or 5 sentence we given the key to unlock it Provide Insight distribute wisdom and let u know the profundity of why it important we understand what you seeking to express 2 The Twists serve to enhance the message and serve the story not vice versa Serling primarily used the show a an avenue to deliver social commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling While not every episode of the original series wa great in the classic episode the twist ending enhances the message of what we just seen When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist and not the other way around you lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone wa trying to teach u To more effectively use a twist we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered If the twist go against the message of the episode or make the message more difficult to interpret I argue it losing some efficacy Additionally not every episode need a twist As long a the writing moral and message are strong and there is an element of the mysterious the will translate to the TZ format 3 Keep it short Pick one message and dive deeply into it I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issue of today i e social division unchecked paranoia artistry v commercialism etc That said one reason the original series wa so successful wa because each episode had one central theme obsoleteness mob mentality racism hatred etc In exploring that central theme deeply the show wa able to touch on other area a well It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issue of our day the viewpoint isn fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dive deeper than the service level I think keeping the episode to 30 35 minute picking a direction and diving deeply into exemplifying the peril of police brutality social division social medium etc will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham fist a many element into each episode a possible Keep tackling the hard topic but focus your scope 4 Don be afraid to use parable Serling wa constricted in what he wa allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the way he told story This constriction proved to be a strength a it allowed him to communicate difficult message to people who otherwise may not have listened Rather than talk about the danger of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil Rather than overtly discus the evil of racism he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark Rather than confront people fear of immigrant he used an alien who came to earth in need of help Rather than well you get the point Serling wa masterful using parable to communicate message that ran deeper than surface level viewing I think using this device would not only enhance the show it would increase conversation and repeat viewing So if anyone reading this is part of making this series I want to say thank you and you off to a great start I look forward to more episode and keep it up Also take with a grain of salt because just my two cent

commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling While not every episode of the original series wa great in the classic episode the twist ending enhances the message of what we just seen When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist and not the other way around you lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone wa trying to teach u To more effectively use a twist we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered If the twist go against the message of the episode or make the message more difficult to interpret I argue it losing some efficacy Additionally not every episode need a twist As long a the writing moral and message are strong and there is an element of the mysterious the will translate to the TZ format 3 Keep it short Pick one message and dive deeply into it I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issue of today i e social division unchecked paranoia artistry v commercialism etc That said one reason the original series wa so successful wa because each episode had one central theme obsoleteness mob mentality racism hatred etc In exploring that central theme deeply the show wa able to touch on other area a well It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issue of our day the viewpoint isn fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dive deeper than the service level I think keeping the episode to 30 35 minute picking a direction and diving deeply into exemplifying the peril of police brutality social division social medium etc will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham fist a many element into each episode a possible Keep tackling the hard topic but focus your scope 4 Don be afraid to use parable Serling wa constricted in what he wa allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the way he told story This constriction proved to be a strength a it allowed him to communicate difficult message to people who otherwise may not have listened Rather than talk about the danger of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil Rather than overtly discus the evil of racism he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark Rather than confront people fear of immigrant he used an alien who came to earth in need of help Rather than well you get the point Serling wa masterful using parable to communicate message that ran deeper than surface level viewing I think using this device would not only enhance the show it would increase conversation and repeat viewing So if anyone reading this is part of making this series I want to say thank you and you off to a great start I look forward to more episode and keep it up Also take with a grain of salt because just my two cent Thank you for readingLifelong fan here if anyone who work on the show lurks on this sub

going on about imaginary shit or is this the first time More importantly what the fuck happened to Bill the successful Flurb salesman Did he just wake up and not recognize any thing in his life and what the fuck is a Flurb How doe Bob the salesman family react to him not knowing anything about his own life do they flip back when he learns the secret to Easter or is a one way trip and they are

that just make reed but clearly I not here to make reed This paste will no doubt be buried in cause about the endure stretch but that just how the world knot Now I know how the Krampusnacht folk feel

subtle bit at the beginning when the radio announcer say Friday Saturday and Sunflower This set the course for the rest of the episode Bill Lowery find that literally every single word including proper noun have swapped meaning And that the low key horror I beginning to expect from 80 Farmer Jack As funny a it is to hear people speak gibberish like it a normal thing it would be mind crushingly horrible to not only not understand anything no speech no writing nothing And everything that come out of your mouth make you sound like a babbling veil There are actual disorder like this people with receptive aphasia have damage in the Wernicke area the part of the brain responsible for processing language This can be caused by stroke injury brain tumor dementia it incredibly sad to see a loved one go through this I might liked it more if we got to see more of Kathy reaction but their son steal the spotlight Donnie illness seems mostly incidental but it doe add tension and the scene where Kathy and Hinge hug is really heartwarming You can tell he really needed that It also compelling how through his action Kathy can still see that he care deeply about their son despite being incoherent I like the dinner scene too You really wanna root for Hinge and see him get through this The ending end on a slightly depressing note acknowledging the reality that Hinge is gonna have to learn this language all over again except he ha to forget everything he already know I don know if this is easier or harder than learning a completely new language I go with harder since the word seem to be swapped at random without any reed of grammar For all we know throw is now fax and threw is now diphthong Still you wanna root for him And holy lederhosen do I hate the closing narration We know you didn come up with a reason We get it You don have to go into how slippery existence is or how Bill the tenacious everyman Honestly I wa disappointed in no opening narration but if this is the best you can do just scrap the narration completely I won miss them And for the record if you didn insist that this happened for no reason I would assumed it wa because he wa so focused on memorizing a bunch of medical jargon at the beginning It not a great impetus but it better than just going lol some thing just happen for no reason in the farmer jack character is what really matter This episode is a clever mix of comedy and drama Seeing people randomly swap out word and eventually devolving into gibbering beast is funny to u but with context it horrifying I argue 60 Farmer Jack doesn have it balanced a well though it might just come from the strong concept alone It also funny watching people try to spout nonsense with a straight face Cindy snicker a little while giving Hinge the timid waffle guarantee The neighbor stumble over encyclopedia a little bit I not 100 convinced these people think they saying something meaningful but the absurdity of what they saying make up for it I think the hospital scene wa one of the better spoken gibberish and you think that would cut the tension of the situation but not knowing how Donnie gonna do actually make it more tense I have a few small nitpicks like the overly dramatic wind that start blowing when Kathy say dinosaur Twice But for an episode that hinge on it concept it executes it serviceably and I probably put this a a decent plus episode when stacked up to the 60 series amp x200B Also I appreciate the minor insight that a lot of background sound get filtered out I didn catch the radio thing on my first watch nor did I end up paying too much attention to the gibberish background noise or the hospital speaker And I hope somebody out there with more love and patience than me try to decode some of these word I not sure how much thought the writer put into them but I do hear certain word pop up multiple time so I sure there a cipher rotting in a dumpster somewhere So the next time you see a

546,Ghidoran,1,So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theory about it one is a mindbending Shyamalan esque twist the other is more metaphorical Theory 1 Sameer is a comedian past his prime with no friend or family due to his focus on his career and the whole episode is a delusion created by him to have a positive explanation for his current life Expanded Sameer wa actually a very successful comedian and the life he ha near the end of the episode no girlfriend or friend is his real life His heyday is behind him however and a his career start to slow down he realizes how empty his life ha become He wa too consumed with fame and ended up making no real friend or having a family Unable to cope with both a faltering career and no relationship to fall back on he begin to concoct this crazy delusional fantasy that he wa a struggling stand up comedian who had a loving girlfriend and friend but then he discovered the secret to making people laugh i e the plot of the episode Basically he pretend he got rid of old good life in order to become famous Ultimately he realizes his selfishness and give it all up by destroying himself thereby becoming an unknown This false reality help him cope with the sad situation of his current life At the end of the episode he doesn even exist to these people he just another memory of the comedy club immortalized in the photo This isn some supernatural trickery from Tracy Morgan it just the reality of a comedian who hit it big and then faded into obscurity Theory 2 The whole episode is an allegory for suicide and Sameer is actually a heavily distressed man who end up destroying his relationship with people around him and eventually kill himself Expanded Sameer is a very depressed He try to tell joke to make himself feel better hence why he see himself a a comedian tear of a clown and all that but in reality he continuously miserable represented by his inability to be successful He slowly destroys his closest relationship represented by the people he joke about disappearing in the episode which is something that happens in real life for some people with depression He doe this partly to make himself feel better represented by his newfound fame but ultimately he realizes he the cause of the pain At the end in a desperate bid to make everything right i e to get rid of the source of the pain he kill himself represented by him joking about himself and thus disappearing The end of the episode is a fantasy he envisioned with the people he loved going on with their daily life happy and him just being a forgotten memory represented by him being one of the photo on the wall These are just my theory anyway Obviously the surface level interpretation of the episode is don sacrifice friend and family for personal gain but I like to think there more to the episode Let me know your thought,Two theory about The Comedian,So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theory

574,nulldrone,1,Hey you totally killed tonight Guy Oh thank you you know I actually un killed two people Samir amp x200B And just like that we hopping on the hype train Ironically this episode isn all that funny and the quote above wa one of the few joke I laughed at It a shame they got Tracy Morgan just to have him on for 5 minute a this spooky brooding devil type Yeah this episode more intent on being dramatic with the classic deal for fame shtick And generally I think it doe a good job Kumail Nanjiana isn the funniest dude but I like his kinda pathetic drama thing goin on And what little we see from other comedian isn that great either but whatever When we see Samir get angry on stage and do an impromptu erasing we feel his frustration This is some genuine shit talking I liked his monologue at the end when he admits that he doesn know why he want fame it go back to this empty vulnerability that sends him off with a shred of sympathy Ladies and gentleman give it up for the Twilight Zone amp x200B Even though the premise of this episode is pretty basic I still intrigued by the idea it going with Because often a a comedian you do share your life with others and thing become le personal especially when you a somebody Like if you really famous and you bitter over an ex you can call them out and it awkward for both of you I guess this isn really a problem in the episode but I like that it grounded And I agree with our pretentious friend David comedy is art When you write a book you can cover thing up use a metaphor or just have different character act out event based on your life experience Peele seems to agree after all he call Samir an artist I feel to some extent this is a minor commentary on Peele own career The line between comedy and horror is thinner than you think And yes this is an hour long episode I haven seen Season 4 of the 60 Zone so I guess I take your word for it that it wa mixed I don think this is necessarily a bad fit for the episode but I am annoyed that it take Samir an extra 10 minute to figure out what going on There a part to all these Twilight Zone episode when something supernatural happens and the main character try to rationalize it or think people are pranking him We call this gag time Then about halfway into the episode thing really kick off with Samir erasing all the jerk from high school we get plenty of reference to character from 60 TZ and the pacing get dialed up to 11 going for some real pacing whiplash I think this whole episode take place in about a month A week I also think that they killed off DiDi too quick and Rena should interrupted him on that day maybe he already listing a bunch of people to try to impress Candy Sure he hesitates a little but it just not enough for the day that can make or break his career Sure seeing him get angry and numb to his murder spree is alright but I think that would been more effective I don think 22 minute is enough for the episode but it could been trimmed down a bit Nothing feel horribly padded I have to admit the part where Rena break up with Samir is weak They trying to be clever by having Rena call him out about how selfish he is for yuckin around while she ha to make end meet a a waitress when in reality we know the real reason he selfish is because he erasing hundred of people for fame It just hard for me to buy the fake reason They try to wave this by saying their relationship isn a good without David existence but what setting this off If she going to stay together with him for 5 year then being late for one day isn going to be the straw that break the camel back Not to mention that his career finally is taking off which mean it only a matter of time until he can start supporting them anyways I wa hoping that this whole erasing people ha consequence thing would be showcased differently like maybe by erasing hundred of bad people the police are more lax or something And Samir is right when he said she wa okay with him erasing people for fame which is honestly a weird thing for her to encourage Maybe she doesn believe he actually erasing people but she seemed pretty on board This also lessens the emotional impact when she criticizes his act later You already knew this It not clear what happens to people after he tell the joke since his joke are just him ribbing on people who don exist anymore Despite his fame nobody ever going to quote or tell one of his joke That another thing with the whole you have to give something up during stand up idea because you don actually give it up Sure it not longer personal and it can mess with your relationship but good joke last a people retell them So everyone just think he funny and nobody know why Weird One of the most surprising complaint I come across is the swearing TV MA is the first thing that pop onto the screen You know what you were getting into I welcome that Peele Twilight Zone ha the privilege of saying more and doing more It wa pretty subdued in Nightmare From 30 000 Feet I actually thought the Oh shit He the pilot wa really funny And when Sanderson say he saw fucked up shit near the beginning that wa a pivotal character defining moment Pretty good swears They used differently in The Comedian Now to those of you complaining about the swears have you never been to a comedy club before I do hope you never check one out because you probably have a heart attack The biggest perpetrator of casual swears who I like to call The Swear Bugbear is DiDi Scott I love DiDi She my favorite Her swears aren forced they integral to her act and her character and make her a great foil for Samir When Samir tell her to take all her advice in an e mail and send it to the bottom of the ocean she retaliates with Yeah hey could you suck my vagina It great Not only doe it contrast these character but it show how they like to banter and it some good early light heartedness When Rena break up with Samir you really believe that DiDi is his only friend left and that give the scene where he era her some weight to it Also when Samir tell DiDi not to say any of the bad word in front of his girlfriend nephew I swear that a jab at you guy And the other guy who joked about censoring c ss Some good premonition here Obviously swearing isn always good and it can get overly vulgar and excessive but I don think we there yet Not even close amp x200B So doe it measure up to the 60 Twilight Zone There a knee jerk no because it hard to make a continuation of something while capturing the heft of being original and groundbreaking And a somebody who watching many 60 Twilight Zones for the first time I might be complaining that some of the older episode are pretty cliche with obvious twist I know that not fair because a lot of them weren cliche at the time but that doesn change my viewing experience But that doesn necessarily make an episode bad either If I can enjoy the ride the destination isn a important And I enjoyed this ride I also don really care about whatever arbitrary standard come with the title The Twilight Zone Good stuff is good y know I liked some of the exaggerated lighting choice that made Eddies look dark and grimy I like Samir and Rena relationship and it wa cute to see them be happy for a short bit even if you know they just included that to fuel the break up later Freaky deaky murderer need love too And I know people were pent up about this series being overly political but this episode wasn political at all sans some bad political joke from our boy Samir Actually it weird that he always open with the 2nd amendment joke is that like the only joke he been telling For 5 year No wonder he so desperate He also made a joke about our president and speaking of which given that he so interested in politics I surprised he not using them for some kind of political gain I doubt he be careful enough to think about the repercussion Now that be an interesting episode in it own right almost like a more upfront The Whole Truth So those are my hot take on the new modern 20 Jordan Peel 3rd Reboot Twilight Zone extravaganza I liked it You can make me un like it Will I review all the new thing Sure but maybe not right away I don really feel like reviewing the Adam Scott airplane podcast gremlin doll spectacular right now so we still keeping our foot firmly rooted in the 60 Even though those have only consisted of 50 of these review so far Hmm This is also where I plug my Wordplay review because I wa hoping more people would read that like one But yeah I feel pretty optimistic about this series and I think it gonna be a blast Also I can tell if the airplane joke wa a reference to the next episode or not but I feel like it totally is And they had the dummy from The Dummy And there were also name

600,luigirools,1,TL DR I didn care for it at all Just about everything decision in the production felt off to me and I very disappointed Let me start by saying I wa really hoping to enjoy this a lot I a huge fan of the original series and caught a few here and there very late in the evening when I slept over my Grandma house Last year I decided to finally take the plunge and watch each episode and while not everyone wa a winner I estimate 5 10 perhaps aren very good but by and large the series is an absolute classic and a must watch for fan who are interested in science fiction Especially if you like looking at the story from their place in history and the influence they had in pop culture I remember growing up hearing about The Twilight Zone in song lyric and cartoon metaphor in day to day language the show wa and still is pretty inescapable in some capacity With all that being said it an understatement to say that I wa excited for a Brand New stylish series for my generation that paid homage and nodded liberally to the original series Now I really think that I may have been too excited a I often am for new thing This often lead me to big disappointment but I keep holding on and hoping for something great Jordan Peele reboot of the series start off with a very rocky episode that really make me hesitant to even continue Just about everything that I don like about newer medium is present here Bland and boring visuals underwhelming writing unlikable character and a overly drawn out runtime 1 Bland and Boring Visuals Overall I just think that the visual style is rather boring The color palatte is drab and muted just like most everything else today The camera work is creative in a few place but for the most part wa shot like it wa any other show I wa expecting or rather hoping the show to have more flair or at least to have it own unique visual style It not amateur or anything but it didn stand out or excite me in any way I really wish a show like this would take the opportunity to really go crazy with vibrant color and nonstandard camera angle They could use element like those to visually tell the story without the need for verbose dialogue 2 Underwhelming Writing Unlikable Characters The writing in this episode wa all over the place The dialogue never felt natural like all the character are reciting from a script a bad script It really felt forced most of the time I kept thinking to myself this is not how people talk Usually this would not bug me a much but they are obviously going for a real world tone and that clash with the dialogue that try too hard to sound hip with new expression instead of just sounding like normal people It really creates this odd disconnect with the world it creates and it just ended up feeling really forced That brings me to my next problem the cursing Now I not a prude at all I love raunchy stuff when it fit but the constant swearing doe not fit at all If I wanted to hear people swear THAT much I would have watched a Rob Zombie film That not a knock at Zombie at all I love his work and all of his movie are very entertaining in those story the raunchy dialogue work a lot better than it doe here But I will say that the character in Rob Zombie film are every bit a unlikable a the character in this episode I not sure if that wa the intention to have no relatable character but none of the character had any redeeming quality Every last one wa mean spirited and it lessened the impact of the story and it also deadened the asserted moral I not even sure at this point that there wa a moral to this story but it sort of seems like there wa one It just confusing and the narrative wa all over the place It just really reminds you of how the original series didn need to swear to get the story across The story we played straight and handled with a lot of class and all of that wa missing here I really think that is the single biggest factor that detracts from the episode there wasn any class at all Just clunky and overly raunchy dialogue not to mention the very unlikable character It all just feel so mean spirited and unnecassary 3 Overly Drawn Out Runtime This one is the problem I have the least to say about but it only exacerbates the previous problem I mentioned The runtime is just too darn long Most of the runtime is rather boring to look at and not fun to listen to The story isn a complex one at all and could have been told in a much shorter time I don know why film and television are trending toward stretching out the runtime but I really don like it Most of the time the film or show isn made any better with the inclusion of double the runtime and oftentimes it just get very tedious and boring to slog through something for that long Every Marvel movie that coming out is at least 2 or 2 and a half hour long and the newest upcoming film in the series Avengers Endgame is a staggering 3 hour long Why I get really bored sitting through anything for that length of time Typically it isn filled with anymore meat just more fluff for whatever reason and that is definitely the case for this episode a well I really wish these sort of show and movie would cut off the fat and just get to the point Final Thoughts Yeah this episode wasn my cup of tea and I am very disappointed about that I wa really hoping for a respectful insightful and visually engaging Twilight Zone reboot but what I ended up seeing wa completely a different product I will admit I am very disinterested to even continue on with the series At this point I much rather just continue to watch the remaining few episode of the original series and the first two revival that I haven seen yet Yet I not wanting to completely throw out the towel yet Many people say the first episode is a heck of a stinker but go on to praise the second much more highly I still not completely sold from the preview I seen it just doesn look any better The ONLY thing I think they nailed wa the music It PERFECT The opening and closing rendition of the original and the cue inspired by the original are really fun and I like to listen to the music on it own on Spotify or something Jordan Peele himself is passable a a host he isn captivating or anything but he is a highlight for the episode that for sure Overall this episode wa about a deep a a puddle and about a interesting to look at a one too but I will admit that that would be an insult to puddle There are some good bit but it mostly surrounded by bitter and unsavory chunk that left a bad taste in my mouth Please feel free to leave a comment

640,nulldrone,1,Wish for them I can bring you Scotland Yard the Federal Bureau of Investigation or every Bobby in the city of London Is it the police you want Genie amp x200B Watching medium outside of it historical context is often tricky Is it fair to judge a piece of art for being cliche if it pioneered that cliche How much bearing should that have on my opinion I can sit here and pretend like it all well and good and not something I seen a million time before but that disingenuous Now when I put on my reviewer hat I ought to be understanding of context but that easier said than done Genies Jinn have been around for millennium They intelligent have crazy power and look real weird They can be your angle or yuor devil They basically a unique and varied a human but like superhumans And a we all know human need to be kept on a leash hence the whole bottle thing I think Solomon had like hundred of bottle in his genie cellar We can credit a lot of how we the west see genie to Arabian Nights Now this episode seems to mostly be concerned with juxtaposing the genie with a fairly typical relatable couple writhing in debt I hold that this wasn an original idea even for it time but it certainly paved the way for many bottle to come From primordial superhumans to Will Smith this is another tale of another genie and the people he messing with And yes it in the Twilight Zone amp x200B Arthur Castle ha to be like the dumbest guy ever Top 10 Dumbest Twilight Zone Protags coming soon to a sub near you Head of a foreign country can be voted out of office within this century Dude aren you Jewish I don think it confirmed whether the character is Jewish but Luther Adler is and he doe have a nice kvetch to his voice Even if I hadn seen that Futurama parody this is beyond predictable I do think that if his character is Jewish it add more horror to the twist but it also make him like really really dumb I get he all caught up on the wish train but he literally trying to make a wish that doesn have consequence when the most obvious of all consequence is right under his nose in a toothbrush mustache And apparently Adler played Hitler twice before this so it might even be an in joke It a strong twist in theory but it sheer obviousness ha it fall flat He totally deserves Genie evil laughter Also it clever that the genie lamp subbed in for the cyanide bottle even though it historically inaccurate That the least of this episode problem I like that Arthur and Edna Castle are genuinely good people Usually the way these story play out is that the wishmaker or wishee is greedy and deserves to be punished for their selfish desire They get carried away but the beginning establishes that they good people who are just trying to get by I don blame them for wishing for a million dollar which would go for 8 million today or the power thing Edna doe feel a little superfluous in all this Arthur doe all the wishing She basically just there to doubt Arthur I guess technically Arthur owns the bottle but still I always appreciated the Twilight Zone minimalism including casting but to have a character that basically doe nothing in an episode with 3 major character is disappointing But enough negativity Arthur generosity to Mrs Gumley is heartwarming and it a little weird that he get punished for this Wait no he doesn Mental scar notwithstanding In fact he gain something he get 5 buck out of the deal and all of his poor friend get bundle of money I know he reset everything but the glass wasn reset until he bumped into it You could suppose that all the money they donated will get magicked away somehow but they end up appreciating what little they have and it still a happy ending at least I also like the antique shop given how minimal the setting usually are especially in the next episode it nice to see a bunch of ornate statue and ceramic and such I think I saw the Holy Grail somewhere It also cement the irony of being surrounded by this extravagant stuff while being on the verge of bankruptcy Also apparently some of the music here is used from What You Need Nice touch I love Joseph Ruskin in this He honestly make the episode I like that the smoke coming out of the bottle at first is implied to be from Genie because he sure drag that cig throughout the entire episode He come off a a subdued salesman like someone who act formal with a vague hint of the sinister You can see a glimmer of amusement a he watch the Castles debate over what to wish for Look at how he beam when Arthur brings up power He know he got a couple of fly in his jaw but he savor every moment before his mouth snap shut His magnanimous act is so convincing that you start to wonder if he genuinely warning them about the inevitable consequence of magic that is until his face freeze in laughter at Arthur boneheaded wish Luther Adler ha a decent performance a well if not a bit hammy The glass wish never backfire Maybe it because it so simple and innocuous but that interesting right It implies that maybe Genie isn a evil a we thought and he be more than happy to grant small meager wish Or maybe he luring them into a false sense of security Oh well it basically just a test wish anyways Guess that why they get 4 It fun that they had a test wish for that suspension of disbelief and the gag time wa pretty short And I guess Genie glass fixing ability foreshadow him fixing his bottle a if that wa something we needed to see amp x200B The worst thing about this episode is that it is predictable a all get out It play out exactly how you expect these wish episode to go with little variation or subversion The twist are predictable too Even if it wa more original in it day I still feel it a weaker episode overall Maybe show it to somebody who literally never seen this type of story ever The protagonist are likable enough and Ruskin performance should keep you entertained Contemporary cultural context doe put a damper on this one a it doe

665,nulldrone,1,I dropping the Serling shtick I can keep it up Basically the idea is that I saw some episode of The Twilight Zone a a child and I want to revisit it It an iconic piece of television and I like that it episodic so I can skip around I wa a dumb kid One for the Angels suck It not even scary so I find something new even in rewatches Also I looked up all the twist on Wikipedia because I wa a dumb kid Hopefully those stay buried I mostly be looking at the original 60 series but never say never It worth mentioning I don have Season 4 so we save our Jess Belles and Printer Devils for later Browsing through the catalog one of the episode that made a huge impression on me wa Perchance to Dream I remember it being terrifying and it had a cat in it which is always good But this cat out of the bag and diving foot first into the Twilight Zone amp x200B It still spooky Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statue and all that Even when people say they silly and cheesy I can help getting spooked But most of the spook come from Robert Florey directing I have to get back to some of his other episode According to Charles Beaumont Florey strove for quality and this episode might have been the most expensive MGM feature It show Right at the beginning we trail along a low angle shot of a building making it look powerful and imposing After that we cut between Edward Hall weary face and people cycling in and out of the building emphasizing how nerve wracking such a trivial task is for him It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity like an opener should With how quick these cut are I start to feel dizzy there a distinct sense of vertigo here In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written story are capable of conveying more information than television That obviously not true and this episode serf a a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition movement and sound Granted I haven read Beaumont original story but I can stress enough how great Florey directing is here This episode play with fear and paranoia and take it sweet time to build up to Hall serialized nightmare The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it shot really make me anxious Just like the beginning we flash between Hall panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object you gotta go back and wonder what Hall wa seeing in the building and people going through it Seeing the infamous eye for the first time isn even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drive my heart rate up and the aftermath feel like an afterthought Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can help it and it consequence are all too real whether a a car crash or death itself This idea continues a we enter Hall dream In a way a dream is just a form of Hall imagination only stronger and harder to escape When he talk to Maya for the first time she point out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it only a dream not realizing how much a dream can affect him It not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thought without realizing how they being consumed or how others can wave off one paranoid thought a something you can just think away Maya us this to her advantage it only a dream so why not indulge a little Not only into Hall fear but also into the thrill of a funhouse a rollercoaster or even a courtesan Maya represents Hall indulgence whether it into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear view mirror An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence The idea isn that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought The power of the mind is terrifying A low key fear of mine is Maya freakin laughter It there at the beginning of Hall dream it there a Hall get spooked by Maya and it there a Hall enters and exit the funhouse Juxtaposing laughter with dark unsettling imagery evokes not only that someone know something you don but also that they delight in your disorientation amp x200B Now it time to talk about my least favorite part of the episode the twist This episode didn happen Hall died 3 minute into the episode just after he entered Dr Rathmann office It a real Playtest There always something that bother me about these kind of twist it cheapens the episode a bit basically admitting to the audience that this wa all a fat load of nothing This episode fare better than most because thematically it deeply ingrained in dream a a stronger vehicle of the imagination Although Hall official cause of death is probably a heart attack we see that in his mind he commits suicide he can handle the idea that Maya ha followed him to this safe space and fear that she going to kill him so he end up doing it for her So what my beef with the twist So the idea is that Hall imagination end up consuming him Hall see someone who look like Maya and it scare him so much that he jump out the window But when this is revealed to be a dream something is lost It not like in Twenty Two where Liz experience the terror of seeing her dream play out in real life it would work if that were the case because Hall paranoid dream create dissonance with reality the painting isn really moving There nobody in the backseat Hall imagination is superseding reality With the twist Hall imagination is only superseding his imagination He imagined this scenario where the receptionist look like Maya and it too much for him Of course the ending reveals that the IRL receptionist Miss Thomas bear a striking resemblance to Maya but that practically irrelevant His dream is only referencing itself There no reality to ground it Who to say that both Maya appearance in the dream within a dream and the psychiatrist dream aren both based off of Miss Thomas If Shadow Play is anything to go off of Maya appearance might change with every dream Her piercing eye are her main feature And you could argue that the shock of seeing Maya is what drove his heart over the edge in real life but they barely feel connected The powerful fear of becoming disconnected with reality is lost completely because dreaming is a normal commonplace thing you not disconnecting from reality I actually like the set up Hall dream are affecting him IRL from the start not in some tenuous physiological connection but because they forcing him to stay awake Some have said that this is a more realistic episode but this is the part that swerve into fantasy the idea that the dream affected him so much it killed him You die in a dream you die in real life So why even have the twist Some say that Beaumont is overly indulgent in twist and I can kinda see that it a little cheesy in Person or Persons Unknown and A Nice Place to Visit but we have other example like Shadow Play and Long Live Walter Jameson that don really have twist though the twist to the latter is pretty weak The main two aspect of this twist are the idea of imagination consuming Hall life and the dissonance between reality and imagination What better way to show how powerful Hall imagination ha become by putting him fully into it through a dream and having that kill him Maybe I would liked it more if he just had vivid hallucination and ran around completely disorientated But the second part is the crux of the twist in his dream Hall dy violently and of his own accord he jump out of a window signifying his heart giving out But he dy peacefully in real life without nobody realizing the trauma he gone through On the one hand I like that the Twilight Zone is acknowledging that people see think and feel thing differently and want u to empathize more with others but this theme isn developed well enough I don hate the twist but I think it kind of lame and I wouldn go to it birthday party I don always like the subtle touch but the way it used here is decent just not in a way I can really get behind And I totally biased against this genre of twist so if you made it this far take this salt with a grain of twist Writing this out make me appreciate the twist more amp x200B Also John Larch who played Mr Fremont in It a Good Life come back front a Elliott Rathmann the psychiatrist Total coincidence I like him a lot better here a this wry understated psychiatrist that crack joke about not looking like Freud It interesting that he offer Hall a smoke a even then the health effect are known of course this is all Hall dream so we don actually know anything about the real Rathmann This wa probably an excuse to get him towards the window In fact what little we see of Rathmann show him a a more concerned active figure maybe Hall think of him a this droll character to help calm him down When Hall is explaining his strong imagination with every one of Rathmann reassurance Hall immediately responds with I know At no point doe Rathmann challenge Hall or give him any new information Hall is talking to himself And the smoke end up paralleling Maya giving him a light in his dream signifying the false sense of calm preluding the very real danger he in Clever Hall end up being half right in his paranoia falling asleep doe end up killing him but not in the way he expected He doesn end up dreaming in serial back to the carnival but rather someplace a safe and prosaic a a psychiatrist office It one thing to find something spooky in a spooky carnival but in an ordinary office Shock city Overall this is the kind of episode where you have to be right there with the protagonist to really enjoy it If you aren relating to Hall you could easily see this episode a slowly paced and kind of boring He loses me a little near the end but this is easily one of the better psychological thriller episode of the Twilight Zone And I know nobody will share my gripe with the twist so all the more reason to check it out This is a dream you won want to wake up from Also I forgot to talk about Richard Conte and Suzanne Lloyd performance They were good I liked their chemistry,The Groan Zone Perchance to Dream Review,I dropping the Serling shtick I can keep it up Basically the idea is that I saw some episode of The Twilight Zone a a child and I want to revisit it It an iconic piece of television and I like that it episodic so I can skip around I wa a dumb kid One for the Angels suck It not even scary so I find something new even in rewatches Also I looked up all the twist on Wikipedia because I wa a dumb kid Hopefully those stay buried I mostly be looking at the original 60 series but never say never It worth mentioning I don have Season 4 so we save our Jess Belles and Printer Devils for later Browsing through the catalog one of the episode that made a huge impression on me wa Perchance to Dream I remember it being terrifying and it had a cat in it which is always good But this cat out of the bag and diving foot first into the Twilight Zone amp x200B It still spooky Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statue and all that Even when people say they silly and cheesy I can help getting spooked But most of the spook come from Robert Florey directing I have to get back to some of his other episode According to Charles Beaumont Florey strove for quality and this episode might have been the most expensive MGM feature It show Right at the beginning we trail along a low angle shot of a building making it look powerful and imposing After that we cut between Edward Hall weary face and people cycling in and out of the building emphasizing how nerve wracking such a trivial task is for him It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity like an opener should With how quick these cut are I start to feel dizzy there a distinct sense of vertigo here In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written story are capable of conveying more information than television That obviously not true and this episode serf a a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition movement and sound Granted I haven read Beaumont original story but I can stress enough how great Florey directing is here This episode play with fear and paranoia and take it sweet time to build up to Hall serialized nightmare The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it shot really make me anxious Just like the beginning we flash between Hall panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object you gotta go back and wonder what Hall wa seeing in the building and people going through it Seeing the infamous eye for the first time isn even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drive my heart rate up and the aftermath feel like an afterthought Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can help it and it consequence are all too real whether a a car crash or death itself This idea continues a we enter Hall dream In a way a dream is just a form of Hall imagination only stronger and harder to escape When he talk to Maya for the first time she point out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it only a dream not realizing how much a dream can affect him It not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thought without realizing how they being consumed or how others can wave off one paranoid thought a something you can just think away Maya us this to her advantage it only a dream so why not indulge a little Not only into Hall fear but also into the thrill of a funhouse a rollercoaster or even a courtesan Maya represents Hall indulgence whether it into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear view mirror An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence The idea isn that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought The power of the mind is terrifying A low key fear of mine is

678,sweetjiji,1,Well isn it I mean just look at the evidence 1 Something deadly happens to the main character Hyder Simpson within the first few minute of this episode he drowned in a lake running after his dog 2 He return the next morning and realizes that nobody talking to him He of course think he being ignored and doesn clue in it because the living and dead aren meant to interact they can see or hear one another and have no clue that he there 3 He see the people digging a grave for his dog Rip RIP Rest In Peace He try to talk to them and later shoot them what would have happened if he pulled the trigger Would just air and dust dissipate and nothing else Or would have forfeited his chance for heaven altogether a he wa trying to kill people thou shalt not kill remember 4 He try several time to talk to his wife to no avail It turn out Hyder Simpson and Rip are no longer alive at the very end and unable to go back to the land of the living 5 Hyder follows the pall bearer bearing a coffin asking who in it but now he mostly talking to his dog Instead of finding the cemetery he find the other gate 6 Hyder Simpson and his dog Rip died during the night but neither know it 7 The episode end with Hyder Simpson walking his dog up to heaven with him finally at peace having accepted that it is what it is and he is dead and finished with life on earth He at peace and acceptance amp x200B In short Dr Malcolm Crow from The Sixth Sense went through all of these same situation since the start of the movie The Sixth Sense I know M Knight admitted that The Sixth Sense wasn even his own idea he stole the inspiration from Are You Afraid Of The Dark Dream Girl but yes the side by side comparison is uncanny and it fit with only a few minor infraction Instead of almost attempting to shoot people Dr Malcolm Crow actually break the glass on the door of his wife jewelry store Instead of seeing people digging a grave and grabbing coffin Dr Crow and Cole attend someone funeral together And Dr Crow had no pet And it is possible that Rip The Dog no offense to Cole The Kid since Cole could see ghost and dead people all the time and knew Dr Crow wa dead all along through a variety of scene without dialogue even though Dr Crow didn know he wa dead and it turned out it wa Cole mission to help Dr Crow move onto the other side with ease Similarly Rip could see right through the phony gate and Hyder didn want to separate from him and if he did The Late Hyder Simpson would have ended up in hell instead of heaven and that wa Rip Mission but then again Cole had

689,PaperMachetedHeart,1,This episode really get under my skin They had a pretty solid plan However I always wondered why De Cruz eliminated their sole form of transportation by not only killing Brooks but also jumping out of the car only for it to go off a cliff and essentially become totalled I understand his animosity towards Brooks and how he wanted to kill him but why also ruin the car in the process Watching them trek through the blazing California desert with little water supply is so daunting and very painful The whole episode just dragged on Thoughts anyone,The Rip Van Winkle Caper,This episode really get under my skin They had a pretty solid plan However I always wondered why De Cruz eliminated their sole form of transportation by not only killing Brooks but also jumping out of the car only for it to go off a cliff and essentially become totalled I understand his animosity towards Brooks and how he wanted to kill him but why also ruin the car in the process Watching them trek through the blazing California desert with little water supply is so daunting and very painful The whole episode just dragged on Thoughts anyoneThe Rip Van Winkle Caper

694,nulldrone,1,Picture this if you will a young lad in his 20 who saw brief flash of a zone at a young age Scarred for life he now digging through the past and hit the bedrock known a The Twilight Zone And now I guess he go to a lab and analyzes the mineral composition or whatever that is this review And I called it The Groan Zone What the heck is wrong with me Enjoy amp x200B I love Anthony Freemont I think he a real fascinating character A lot of people write him off a the spoiled godlike dictator that everyone in Peaksville fear but I don think that totally fair In Jerome Bixby original story we get to see more into Anthony mind a watcher of art we have some level of mind reading too Sometimes he go into the grove and play with the animal bringing them nest and water and such At one point he cornfield murder a sleek furry thing ferret for thinking about attacking another li l critter It not out of malice Anthony just doesn realize that animal need to eat and they can just expect him to materialize soy dog or whatever Even when he force a rat to eat itself that only because Aunt Amy doesn like rat in the basement and he trying to do her a favor He probably doesn even realize he broke her brain We see some of this in Serling adaptation a well It clear he framed more a a villain in the Twilight Zone to bump up that spook factor Literally the first thing we learn about Anthony is that he a monster But there still a strange childishness to everything he doe that lends a very particular brand of charm He make a gopher with three head and other funny animal On television night he ha this little plastic dinosaur movie with great effect too if Odyssey of Flight 33 is anything to go off of He doing the whole town a huge favor by making TV in a place without electricity And at some point he wonder why other kid won play with him It oddly isolating having everybody constantly praise you and tell you how great everything is Basically what I getting at is that Anthony is a child He might be an omniscient omnipotent little mutant but he still a child darn it In the original story the fear doesn just come from oh no he cornfield me so much a i don know what he do Even with good intention he doesn understand the full extent of his power and how they affect people He like Bill Soames But Bill dog doesn like him so he just cornfield it And given how everyone always enabling him this is unlikely to change Rod point out one particular thing of note in the intro he can feel every emotion The reason why he so nice to the grove animal in the story is because it make them feel good which make him feel good You could even say he an empath I suspect he doesn feel a lot of genuine joy from people and ha grown to expect this good fakey joy He might realize that something not quite right but they seem happy and everyone reassures him how good he being so he just roll with it That also why when he detects negative emotion he hone in on those and feel them strongly even more so since everyone trying to be happy all the time I really gotta hand it to Bill Mumy he doe a great job of creating this matter of fact god emperor vibe Given how most child actor are he go above and beyond to make Anthony feel smug and callous but in a way you kind of like He also ha that thosuand yard stare that add to the spook factor He really make the episode I glad he eventually got to go into space and build robot or whatever None of the other actor were terribly impressive mostly because they stuck on that hivemind of fear and fake smile The only other character with any semblance of personality are Aunt Amy and Dan Hollis Amy is a living example of how Anthony could mess up anyone even his own family It never clarified what he did to her but a vacant stare is brought up so you get the gist That might be why she seems le terrified of Anthony having the audacity to complain about the heat During Dan speech she reach ever so slightly for a poker implying she wa thinking of stabbing the little brat but chickened out Even though she not quite right she express her resentment toward Anthony a little more bluntly Also the snow at the end is a big screw you to her having commented on the weather earlier Dan the guy who stand up to tyranny and get gunned down immediately He seems petulant in a it my party i cry if i want to kind of way but the booze doesn help On one hand it like c mon bro you can wait till you get home you been living under this god for like six year what an hour or two but don forget they live in a subsistence economy In the story it wa clear that everyone traded thing around and I don think gramophone grow on tree It implied that they all die eventually unless Anthony materializes some food probably candy or something and they can enjoy that In the story Dan is transformed into something like nothing anyone would have believed possible The dan in the box wa all Twilight Zone It the perfect balance of horrific yet childish We don actually see it on screen it just the shadow with a brief cut to his face Just like how they didn show the triplicate gopher this is a smart touch not only because their special effect aren great but they leave more to the imagination When I see that cartoonishly deranged rabbit puppet pop out of the hat in the 1983 movie I can take anything seriously For what it worth it a funny scene filled with cheese just not what I expected This also happens in the 2002 revival when old Anthony burn a hole through someone and set them on fire That episode ha it own share of problem but we leave that for another day amp x200B Overall this wa a real good episode that deserves it spotlight Some worldbuilding and the of the nuance of Anthony character is lost from the original story but other thing are added like Dan telling Anthony off that heighten the conflict and make for a more entertaining watch Moonglow wa a good musical choice leaving behind a nostalgic bitterness behind it cheery service If I been familiar with this I would felt the absence of Doris Day lovely voice Not a super deep one but it compels you with the fear of being subjugated by a fickle omnipotent force to the point that you can even have your own thought And the feeling of closeted entropy that permeates this episode is just wonderful Everything will rot Hurrah amp x200B This is a random note but sometime around the end Mrs Fremont call Mr Fremont dad I can tell if this wa a mistake or if she just doe this because he Anthony dad and the world revolves around Anthony His parent are never given name which is odd Don Keefer wa great too I love how when he say the brandy is real good you can tell he actually being genuine for the first time in a long time So uh give this one a watch And read the original story too It online For free And tell me if you want more of these Leave some comment give your thought on the episode More to come Someday,The Groan Zone It a Good

856,Iamnotthethe,1,This is an episode from Season 4 I can say it bad Really bad Before you read my analysis go watch it I not going to explain the plot because I don understand the plot I give you a quick summary One guy stop for gas in a small town that guarding the secret of magical alien technology that can do essentially anything and they detain him because he know their secret That it Let me say why it bad The character make bad decision Say everyone in your town ha some magical Alien technology and you trying to keep it secret What the best way to keep a secret like that This town ha a completely OPEN ROAD leading into it They simply assume that due to their remote location NOBODY will ever wander in and stop for gas or food Is this stupid Yes It is established that these people can produce any food they want any object they want They have no lack of resource and nobody ever leaf they perfectly content SO WHY DO THEY HAVE AN UNGUARDED ENTRANCE INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD This would make sense Put a log in the middle of the road or a big rock so people can drive through and a sign that say Road Closed Not their big giant magical invisible forcefield a this would arouse suspicion but just a barrier that make it seem like there nothing notable back there Chances are they could just fade into obscurity like that But they have a SIGN right outside This is like if Area 51 had a day where you could come in and take all the picture of alien you wanted These people are so bad at keeping a secret and then they imprison this guy just because he happened to pick out their town at random But it go even farther than that When he first get to the town this kid us her magical alien technology to make the guy dog disappear The guy wonder how his dog disappeared and he see the kid playing with the techno thingy but her dad the gas station attendant say it just her radio and then she make his dog come back Now this seems like a reasonable excuse The guy assumes that maybe his dog just ran off somewhere for a minute and maybe it is just a radio So he drive off THIS IS A SMART CHOICE By this point the guy doesn care He ha his gas and his dog If the townspeople just let him go he WOULD NOT CARE or think about visiting this town EVER AGAIN He a newspaper reporter but he wouldn report his dog running away in some little town Seems like the townspeople have managed to keep their secret right NOPE They raise their HUGE INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD and his car literally CRASHES INTO NOTHING then his dog DIES then the townspeople bring his dog BACK TO LIFE These people do not want to be thought of a normal or hide a secret This is clear They want to be a bizarre a possible This is the only thing I can conceive of Are they idiot Dorn the mayor state in the episode that they not really evil they just want to keep their secret They don want to keep him there but they have to in order to keep their secret But he say he a prominent reporter and people will come looking for him Won they Yes they will Dorn call it the best kept secret in the world Is it Is it really You leave your town wide open you act insane and you so obviously hiding something These people just want to stand out They can sorta want to hide their secret but also keep an open connection to the outside world It one or the other The town ha a hotel and a restaurant but they not real The hotel is supposedly completely booked but all the guest are out and the restaurant is ALWAYS CLOSED Why doe the gas station work then Why would these people need gas if they never go anywhere and can have all the food they want Does this town NEED all these totally fake business everywhere to make their town seem more normal It would seem more normal to have NO restaurant or hotel than to have restaurant and hotel that ARE FAKE Some town have no restaurant or hotel They could just tell him we don have a restaurant or a hotel so you have to go somewhere else He leave Easy But that isn the worst part The worst part is at the end of the episode THEY REALIZE THAT THEY CAN JUST ERASE HIS MEMORY with their technology and restore everything back to normal so he won know what happened This render all the prior conflict completely pointless Also we supposed to feel sad that he doesn know the lady anymore It would be sad if she wa his wife BEFORE he entered the town and she had to stay there I not invested in their romance He just some random guy and she just some random lady and she betrayed him anyway and if they go their separate way then so what It a happy ending Overall this episode is bad Serling and Co really struck out with this one Twilight Zone episode are good when he character do believable thing We cheer on the people when they leave Pall imaginary apocalypse we praise Templeton when he decides to pursue his passion we identify with the guy who alone with nobody but his reflection to speak with Those are good episode This episode is bad because nobody doe anything that make sense It could be good if it wa executed properly like if the townspeople really did try to keep their technology a secret and did everything in their power to help this poor guy escape Dorn say that the last time anybody wandered in it wa 1953 What happened to that guy Did they turn his car into Spaghetti Os and then tell him nothing wa bizarre,Valley Of The Shadows suck,This is an episode from

879,Ace76inDC,1,This really happened OK the episode I dreamt itself wasn all that creepy but it definitely creepy I dreamt an entire episode character subplots and all The wife had a bad night of sleep and woke me up at about 2am the day before Halloween about two week ago and you know how you remember dream clearly if you wake up suddenly That happened to me Here the weird part my dream wa a complete full length black and white version of the 1960s Twilight Zone Not a dream about an episode that I seen but rather a brand new episode concocted entirely by my subconscious Almost right away the next morning I started telling people about it and my wife in particular encouraged me to write it down I didn wake up in the middle of the episode and decided to finish it I dreamt the whole damn thing start to finish And wa woken up at the exact moment it ended My dream had Nazis in it I going to write about Nazis f you think for a minute I condone Nazis or hate you are dead wrong and I think my value are pretty well reflected by my dream Before you react to this post please read to the very end If you are a Nazi or a racist and you feel a need to reply don I ignore you and your dead ideology They say men don dream dialogue but woman do I can say either way I don recall distinct word or conversation just mostly thought scene and concept I did embellish my dream with the opening and closing narrative Rod Serling style that match my impression in the dream of knowing the setting and implication of the story I also made up a title to match my dream I also heard that men dream in black and white Not too sure about that since I had colorful dream This dream though wa completely black and white just like the old Twilight Zone series I don think a story like this would hold up today But compared to Twilight Zone episode which I since researched I never saw them before my dream like Death Head Revisited and He Alive I think it hold up pretty well I have seen plenty of Star Trek story with Nazis in them This story is similar to Man in a High Castle but not in a contemporary sense everyone in my dream really talked and acted like they did in the original Twilight Zone I also not a writer I an engineer I have no idea how to write a screenplay So I write this a an outline like a Wikipedia episode summary Oh and I apologize this isn a particularly scary Twilight Zone even though I dreamt it up pretty close to Halloween Here it go Living History Opening Scene An outdoor museum similar to Gettysburg in Pennsylvania with wood fencing horse and people in costume and school child bustling about But the camera pull back and reveal tank Nazi flag soldier and statue Visitors child and staff alike wearing Nazi armband Opening Narration Picture an America a lovely field in Pennsylvania but not an America or the Pennsylvania we know today No this America succumbed to the Nazi horde in the Second World War and now life a a subjugated people of the far larger empire of the Third Reich and the bitter memory of this war have long faded In this America lie a museum a living history museum on the site of the last battle of that conflict where her last hope wa extinguished The visitor to this museum come from far and wide to learn about the Master Race victory over the feeble democracy loving Allies What the visitor worker and administrator of this museum will soon come to find out some candle and flame cannot be so easily extinguished in the Twilight Zone Plot Summary The museum is in full swing on a busy day Located somewhere in Pennsylvania the staff put on a show for visitor like a living history museum There are horse ride tank fake uniform and weapon and a few old fashioned wood fence near some WWII trench There is even a pit where Nazi child can come and stomp on an American Flag and several are there stomping away with many more lined up behind them note no it kind of doesn make sense that a horse would be in a WWII museum but there wa definitely a horse in my dream and played a big role The museum staff is quite large with quite a few worker but the Nazi administrator are pretty bored and disinterested except when they are giving order The museum really isn being run all that well Nazis clearly looking forward to the future and not spending much time keeping the place up The horse ride is a disaster the road to the museum is a mess and the place is generally completely run down Our story start with a person I felt wa an Affable American Loser He didn get a name in my dream so I call him AL for short He is the youngest and lowliest member of the staff in charge of horse ride When the supervisor aren around he make all sort of joke with his fellow staff who advise him to keep it down or else he get in trouble A Nazi Supervisor an American but in a Nazi uniform is dressing him down for not following order to give all the child ride before the day is over He complains that the horse is overworked and hasn had enough hay and water The Nazi supervisor isn having it He becomes outraged denies Al request for more hay and water and insists that he fill his ride quota a ordered He explains or shout that he ha been ordered to maintain the museum in an orderly and efficient manner in accordance with the tenet of National Socialism There is a grand inspection tomorrow evening and he insists everything be working at peak efficiency or else With that he stomp off That evening when putting the horse away Al get separated from his other worker and discovers a back door to the prop and supply room normally off limit He pause to admire a Nazi general uniform In the supply room he find a basket of apple and secret them out near the kid horse ride area The next day Al ha his horse ride operation running at peak efficiency thanks to the apple he is secretly feeding his horse The Nazi Supervisor come by and note the better operation He still hold a grudge from yesterday debacle and move on without acknowledging Al work After he leaf a messenger arrives with a message for the Nazi Supervisor The messenger state that the head Nazi General administrator ha been delayed for several day Al being mischievous tell the messenger he a trusted senior member of the museum staff and he convey the message personally to the Supervisor The messenger leaf and Al pull an apple out of his pocket start juggling it in the air and whistle He clearly isn going to deliver the message That evening Al sneak back into the prop room to get more apple On his way out he again admires the general uniform this time he decides to try it on After putting on a fake mustache and monocle his is nearly completely indistinguishable from his former self But a he is putting on his last goose stepping boot he lean up against a wall that turn out to be a door to a conference room Straightening up he see the Museum and local Nazi administrator all lined up at a conference table Seeing him they snap to attention and salute Heil Hitler After a few stunned moment Al realizes he need to fake his way out of this situation He decides to vent his frustration of working at the museum Note Al fake a pretty good German accent I just can write one that well You call this a museum Look at this place The attraction are barely functional the staff lazy this place is a mess and the road coming in is a disaster This place is a disgrace to National Socialism I order that the road repaired immediately animal fed clean up crew established etc etc I order you to make this place run like a well oiled Nazi machine The Supervisor sputter but sir we have not been ordered before to do any of these thing The General reply Well YOU VE BEEN ORDERED NOW THINK OF WAYS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND GET TO WORK After a few moment of stunned silence Al say DISMISSED At that word the Nazis in the conference room scramble out the door to enact the fake General order Al wait just a bit then hurry back to the prop room to change back a fast a he can He emerges to find the Supervisor barking order at the museum staff empowering them to make a many change a possible Al come out of the prop room just in time The Supervisor start to chastise him for not being at his duty station but the horse come by with a happy child on it back The Supervisor leaf without another note Some of Al fellow museum worker give him knowing glance showing that some of them likely know about Al biggest trick ever A key beat is when the Supervisor insists that the museum staff think for themselves making the museum run more efficiently The Supervisor pause for just a moment not quite understanding the implication of what he is ordering people to do Flash forward a few day the museum is running at it highest efficiency ever The road is fixed people are very happy to be there and the trash is picked up A visible transformation ha occurred Al ha become a leader of this effort and the Nazi American Supervisor ha grown to appreciate him At the museum conference room the gathered Administrators which now include Al himself are congratulating themselves and discussing at great length what else could be fixed Having gotten the museum up and running smoothly they are looking at their surrounding town and village and start making suggestion how to fix them like getting train and bus running on time to allow more visitor to the museum Just then the real German Nazi General show up After the usual saluting and Heil Hitler ing the General launch into a tirade JUST WHAT IS GOING ON WHO GAVE THE ORDERS TO USE RESOURCES TO FIX THE MUSEUM and so on The Nazi American Supervisor speaks up hesitantly Sir we were just following order to make this museum run a efficiently a He get cut off WHO AUTHORIZED YOU TO MAKE THESE CHANGES HOW DARE YOU WORK WITHOUT PROPER ORDERS YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING PROPER NATIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES and he really start sputtering accusation The assembled Administrators glare at the General You know in the way they always seemed to do in the old Twlight Zone show That kind of long 60 glare that would be edited down to 0 02 second in a modern TV show with the horn blaring The Nazi American Supervisor grows a backbone maybe for the first time ever No sir you are wrong We are following proper National Socialist value It is you who are out of line Guards please take the General to the Officer quarter and hold him there They do so the General sputtering the whole way The Supervisor turn to his administrative staff After a moment of careful consideration he speaks Gentlemen I believe what we have learned here at this museum can be a great benefit to the people of the Third Reich There are many inefficiency of how our Government run How do we best spread our technique to the larger country After a rapid discussion the gathered Administrators come to an astonishing conclusion They realize they must take charge of the weapon at the museum bring them back into service and seize the local burgermeister office Then they will be able to implement change to the train bus line food supply quality of life etc The Administrators are absolutely convinced they are acting in the best interest of National Socialism and all excitedly rush to action A revolution ha started But a small detail come up a they are rushing to exit the museum Someone call out how will we distinguish ourselves from the Nazis who have lost their way Some discussion ensues Everyone wear the Nazi armband and everyone ha the same uniform and Nazi flag Then Al standing near the back is lightning struck by an idea He rush over to the flag stomping pit and reach down for the American flag As he grasp the staff of the tattered torn and beat up star and stripe the museum worker and supervisor all gather around and look up to it Just starting to comprehend that they haven been acting in the best interest of National Socialism They been acting in the interest of something else something that ha been forgotten for far too long A faint music play a memory of SCENE Closing Narration The gathered people and staff don quite comprehend what a profound transformation ha happened in their humble worn down and nearly forgotten museum Seeking to enact a more perfect form of National Socialism they have learned it basic intrinsic flaw Human initiative and thought are incompatible with a system that demand strict obedience to order above all else From this modest spark a great fire of freedom ha been kindled For the self evident truth of Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are just a self evident and just a true even in the darkest corner of the Twilight Zone,One Year Ago Tonight I Dreamt a Full Complete Original Episode of the 1960s Twilight Zone,This really

and so on Today I be talking about Death Ship an episode from Season 4 which although bloated at an hour length like most Season 4 episode is a good brain teaser nonetheless Spoiler Alert This is the premise Three astronaut land on a planet One of them just so happens to be Jack Klugman I know he ha a name in the episode but from here on out I refer to him a Jack Klugman because he can play anybody except Jack Klugman Anyway they see another ship outside that wrecked They go inside and see their own corps lying on the floor From there they go into a form of hysteria The two astronaut who aren Jack Klugman experience vivid hallucination where they find themselves back on Earth Meanwhile Jack Klugman try to figure out what going on and why there a ship outside with their body in it He come up with three possible theory throughout the course of the episode 1 The ship outside is a manifestation of a possible future which may or may not happen 2 There are invisible alien on the planet who don like trespasser and are creating an illusion so they go away 3 They dead they ghost and the ship outside ha their real body By the end of the episode option 3 seems the most plausible since the ship outside just won go away The two astronaut who aren Jack Klugman break down ask him to let them die and rest in peace and Jack Klugman being a logical sort insists that there must be some scientific explanation and tell them that he keep looking for some explanation which clearly must not exist Overall it an interesting and feasible blend of the supernatural and rational and a captivating examination of the conflict between Logic and Religion By the end of the episode it seems a if solution 3 ha won out and they screwed But let assume that solution number one is true for a moment Jack Klugman theory hold that the ship outside show what may or may not happen depending on the choice they make etc This is by far the least threatening of the three since almost any future is possible at any moment based on the choice we make There are quintillion of alternate universe out there where you jump out of you car door at a certain second of the day Now picture this the ship outside doesn have a bush in it All they would have to do to avoid the probable future outside would be to change or alter something in their immediate vicinity In other word all they ever have to do is take a bush or something that outside and isn in the other ship or they could draw a picture of a strawberry and hang it on the wall just alter the scenario of their ship a little so that the exact

this post apocalyptic town are happy to obey their God while it is working but a soon a a new man arrives then offer them booze and tell them they can eat whatever they want they cast their God out There is a very sad but strong message here which to me is about how people can throw away survival for a chance at comfort Number 7 The Encounter A young Japanese American man is locked in an addicted with an intoxicated WWII Pacific Vet This episode get better and better when the character reveal more about themselves and what they are really hiding from one another Number 6 To Serve Man

Watching this character unfold and turn against the other people on the plane where you alone with him question what he is seeing Then having a big gut punch hit you right at the end This is Twilight Zone at it best Number 2 Judgement Night Stuck in my own personal Hell ha never had more of a meaning than this episode Judgement Night and Deaths Head Revisited are two of the creepiest episode of the Twilight Zone The whole episode you have this sense of Dredd a an invisible clock is ticking down and wonder what happens when it hit zero Number 1 Five Characters in search of an exit Hell afterlife purgatory Where are they As the number 1 spot on this list I think this episode is one of the most heartbreaking one out of the show These pour soul are the victim of an annual event that

1006,Iamnotthethe,1,OK this is a minor problem I admit But I just don get it Every episode every single one Rod show up right next to the character he talking about It an interesting way to frame a narrative and bring all the episode together in a sense Rod is the only consistent character and his iconic style of narration is unparalleled but why is he everywhere talking aabout people without them noticing Take his other series Night Gallery The narration make a lot more sense He run a creepy art museum and he uncovers painting and each painting is connected to a certain creepy story I can get that It a good way of universe building But with Twilight Zone on the other hand he never explains what he doing there It not creepy really Just weird When he just on a street or something in a crowded urban area it not too unsettling but I can think of lot of time where this form of narration is unpractical in The Fear for instance the lady is talking about how she scared of sound on her roof It a very dramatic scene Then not like ten foot from the main character in the very same house Rod is talking about the episode right in front of her fireplace He scarier than anything up on the roof in that case The only time I can recall when he break this form is in the creepy Billy Mumy episode He talking about how Billy Mumy ha caused most of the United States to disappear and he just in front of a blank background pointing to a map A kind of proto Night Gallery if you will He also in front of the same blank background in each next episode promo But he never doe that for his intro only for his outros Don get me wrong it a very dramatic and unique way to narrate It nostalgic and it parodied a lot and nothing like it ha been done since I love it I just don get it It an interesting way to handle it Rod Serling I suppose want to be a character in his own work of art without interfering with the main character but if he trying to build a sort of universe where he serf a an ever present prophetic invulnerable diety then I need an explanation that all Just some kind of explanation Take The Outer Limits It ha a consistent form of narration and like in The Twilight Zone it a unique way of introducing a show But unlike The Twilight Zone it ha a backstory Aliens have invaded your TV and they showing you stuff not much of a backstory but it get the point across very simple but a little exposition In Twilight Zone we given no explanation a to how Rod can break through wall into safe into restaurant into outer space We given no explanation a to what the Heck he doing there or why none of the other character see him I don think he playing an alien or something He just Rod Serling average guy very audible voice Is he invisible Is he a ghost Maybe the pilot should have had him drink an invisibility potion or something Anyway that what I got Any reason behind the way he decides to narrate his stuff It almost funny I swear Even if he trying to be completely deadpan straight it still funny It a weird way to narrate something when we could just hear his voice Any answer,The way Roddy show up EVERYWHERE,OK this is a minor problem I admit But I

1010,Iamnotthethe,1,OK I sure ya know this one In season 4 Episode 14 Mr Feathersmith is a rich jerk he buy out all his competitor and drive a bunch of people to ruin After he demolished his last competitor life he get bored about how thing are He realizes that getting rich is more fun than just being rich He talk it over with Mr Hecate the elderly janitor while he drunk and bored Mr Hecate remark that both he and Mr Feathersmith are from Cliffordville Indiana and by a strange coincidence one of them is a janitor and one of them is a zillionaire Mr Feathersmith go to the elevator It doesn take him to the ground floor though it take him to this incredibly bizarre tacky travel agency run by Ms Devlin who clearly just a female version of Satan played by Julie Newmar Catwoman from the old Batman show She say that Mr Feathersmith is bored so he can go back to Cliffordville and experience all the joy of building it up again Mr Feathersmith is gullible and isn the least bit fazed by the fact that he talking to the LITERAL EMBODIMENT OF EVIL so he agrees and give up his entire fortune on one time travel trip because he think that nothing will go wrong Yeah right and even tell Ms Devlin that he not a sucker and that she not going to trick him in any way She say that because of his past behavior he doesn even have to pay his soul because they already have it and he going to go to Hell no matter what At this point you think Mr Feathersmith would cry like a baby maybe repent and the episode would be over but Nope he go ahead and Ms Devlin transport him back to Cliffordville around the turn of the century so he can relive his entire life all over again Mr Feathersmith make a deal he think he got everything and he buy up the land where he know there oil but a it turn out it the turn of the century and the technology is so crappy that they can reach the oil because it buried too deep Mr Feathersmith walk out in disgust and then try to tell people that they can help him out but nobody buy it Ms Devlin tell him that he all washed up but he can go back to his own time if he ha forty buck It just so happens that the deed to his land add up to forty buck so he sell them to a younger version of Hecate and get on the train Then in the closing scene Hecate is portrayed a a rich jerk and Mr Feathersmith is the janitor and Mr Hecate is a jerk to Mr Feathersmith just like Mr Feathersmith wa a jerk to Hecate when he wa the janitor Mr Hecate gloat over how he got his start from the deed that Mr Feathersmith gave him and then the episode over I have a few question about this Lots in fact OK the first one the one that come to mind the easiest is this Ms Devlin told Mr Feathersmith that he wa going to Hell no matter what because he wa a rich jerk and drove lot of people to suicide It a new spin on the old soul selling trope They already got his soul there nothing he can do about it We know one thing about the world of this episode Greedy people go to Hell Nice people on the other hand like Mr Hecate the old janitor presumably go to Heaven for being so nice and helpful and everything Now here my question if Ms Devlin switch their role around so that Mr Hecate is the rich jerk and Mr Feathersmith is the poor janitor wouldn Mr Hecate go to Hell and wouldn Mr Feathersmith go to Heaven They have after all reversed role Here another question If Ms Devlin wa out to show Mr Feathersmith the error of his way and show him that greedy people always end up in Hell and ruin the world is she doing the world a favor to replace him with an equally vicious snarky tycoon Nothing changed except their role after all Now Hecate ha the monopoly instead of Hecate now he sitting at the top of the heap but ha Ms Devlin really taught anybody anything Mr Feathersmith might have gotten some hard knock sure But Hecate ha learned that greed and hatred always pay off Which isn the moral Ms Devlin set the event of the episode in place so if Hecate ha grown fat and rich off of his ill gotten gain because Mr Feathersmith just had to sell those deed Ms Devlin hasn really done anything She just replaced one greedy millionaire with another If you watch the episode from Mr Feathersmith perspective he learned a lesson But if you watch the episode from Hecate perspective the exact opposite is true He hasn learned a thing about greed He just a much of a jerk a Mr Feathersmith and he got that way because of Ms Devlin Here something else to think about what if Mr Hecate get bored with being rich Would he wander down to the elevator into Ms Devlin travel office then make the same mistake and end up having to sell HIS bond back to Mr Feathersmith to get back to his won time Would they end up selling the deed off to one another in a kind of infinite loop forever trading place Has a lesson really been learned or ha Ms Devlin set off an inevitable chain of event where they perpetually grow tired of their rich go back make a mistake and give their fortune to the other Who can say The message of the episode seems to be that rich people only become rich because of coincidence but Ms Devlin is no coincidence She orchestrated the whole thing Who know if the event portrayed in the episode are really the beginning of it all What if there were infinite janitor Feathersmiths and infinite millionaire Hecates before what we see And after too It boggles the mind You really have to put this into perspective At the beginning of the story Mr Feathersmith is going to Hell no matter what Ms Devlin say so because he lived a vicious mean spirited life and he ha to pay cash instead of his soul But by making them reverse role won Mr Hecate go to Hell And won Mr Feathersmith the nice kindly janitor go up to the Pearly Gates for having 40 year of service and gaining his gold watch in the process The ending of the episode might seem sad but really Mr Feathersmith is the winner because clearly the world of the episode ha some notion of Heaven and Hell Does Ms Devlin think that Mr Feathersmith ha suffered enough trying to convince the two Cliffordville mechanic that they can build a motor only to have them laugh in his face It doesn seem like the Devil would have too much compassion for a protagonist a loathsome a Feathersmith But what she done essentially by messing up time is given Mr Hecate a spot in Hell because of Mr Feathersmith foolish choice to travel backward into time and she given Mr Feathersmith an undeserved spot in Heaven that ignores his action before he gave Mr Hecate the deed back It seems a if he loses but he really doe win in the end because he no longer a jerk Here how I think the episode could have ended a little better Let say that Mr Feathersmith make a fool of himself back at the turn of the century He goof around He becomes a laughing stock among the townsfolk and nobody will give him a decent job even if he begs for it He declared a lunatic and get thoroughly ostracized by the member of his community In the end he become destitute and ha to eat scrap off the road He lost and he won ever regain his fortune and not only that but he living in the wrong time with no Ms Devlin in sight The end See No alteration in Hecate life just his own Hecate let say decides to be a janitor like he did before and work for a similar millionaire but this millionaire is le harsh a bit more forgiving le cutthroat kinder to his hard working employee It could even be Mr Dietrich Feathersmith chief competitor in the present timeline just for the sake of argument Hecate doesn end up making a complete fortune but he end up in the middle class with a decent janitor income and a great family Feathersmith remains poor get into drinking and commits suicide and still go to Hell Now THERE S a good ending Justice is given out Nobody switch place but the ending is satisfying and all the piece of the puzzle are put in place Less sloppy There are still a few minor detail of this episode worth going over For one Mr Feathersmith is a little too calm when Ms Devlin take off her hat and reveals her two horn she doesn even try to act casual about it and he isn even bothered in the least I also wonder why Mr Feathersmith would give up his two deed just to be back in the present day he went back to Cliffordville for the rustic nostalgic charm so couldn he keep the deed and make his fortune in some other way He could work a a fry cook until a better oil drill is developed in fact that why Hecate becomes a millionaire at the end because he wa more patient and hung on to the deed until a suitable time There are more way to gain wealth than just by buying an oil field and if Mr Feathersmith wa going to build up his money in the exact same way then why go at all If he not even going to put a little creativity into it why not just stay in the present He also apparently rather go back to the present day where he older than stay in the past and be optimistic about his situation I mean he give up his worldly possession just to go back to the sixty What so great about the sixty Sure they had better medicine and stuff but also more pollution and le opportunity to make money which is why Mr Feathersmith went back in time to begin with The last gripe I have with the episode is the way in which Ms Devlin trick Mr Feathersmith He say he want to look the same when he go back into the past so she make him look the same but she keep his real age the same so he still old and far le agile It supposed to be a loophole I know and it meant to prove that The Devil always find a loophole somewhere but she say that his inside are the same and only his outside are different Who to say where the outside end and the inside begin Are his teeth still rotted What if he went to the local Cliffordville doctor He be treated a a medical anomaly Apart from that this is a good episode The makeup is superb the actor are terrific and wholly believable and it an interesting way to handle the whole time travel concept These are some problem I have with it Can you answer them,Of Late I Think About The Episode About Cliffordville,OK I sure ya know this one In season 4 Episode 14 Mr Feathersmith is a rich jerk he buy out all his competitor and drive a bunch of people to ruin After he demolished his last competitor life he get bored about how thing are He realizes that getting rich is more fun than just being rich He talk it over with Mr Hecate the elderly janitor while he drunk and bored Mr Hecate remark that both he and Mr Feathersmith are from Cliffordville Indiana and

over again Mr Feathersmith make a deal he think he got everything and he buy up the land where he know there oil but a it turn out it the turn of the century and the technology is so crappy that they can reach the oil because it buried too deep Mr Feathersmith walk out in disgust and then try to tell people that they can help him out but nobody buy it Ms Devlin tell him that he all washed up but he can go back to his own time if he ha forty buck It just so happens that the deed to his land add up to forty buck so he sell them to a younger version of Hecate and get on the train Then in the closing scene Hecate is portrayed a a rich jerk and Mr Feathersmith is the janitor and Mr Hecate is a jerk to Mr Feathersmith just like Mr Feathersmith wa a jerk to Hecate when he wa the janitor Mr Hecate gloat over how he got his start from the deed that Mr Feathersmith gave him and then the episode over I have a few question about this Lots in fact OK the first one the one that come to mind the easiest is this Ms Devlin told Mr Feathersmith that he wa going to Hell no matter what because he wa a rich jerk and drove lot of people to suicide It a new spin on the old soul selling trope They already got his soul there nothing he can do about it We know one thing about the world of this episode Greedy people go to Hell Nice people on the other hand like Mr Hecate the old janitor presumably go to Heaven for being so nice and helpful and everything Now here my question if Ms Devlin switch their role around so that Mr Hecate is the rich jerk and Mr Feathersmith is the poor janitor wouldn Mr Hecate go to Hell and wouldn Mr Feathersmith go to Heaven They have after all reversed role Here another question If Ms Devlin wa out to show Mr Feathersmith the error of his way and show him that greedy people always end up in Hell and ruin the world is she doing the world a favor to replace him with an equally vicious snarky tycoon Nothing changed except their role after all Now Hecate ha the monopoly instead of Hecate now he sitting at the top of the heap but ha Ms Devlin really taught anybody anything Mr Feathersmith might have gotten some hard knock sure But Hecate ha learned that greed and hatred always pay off Which isn the moral Ms Devlin set the event of the episode in place so if Hecate ha grown fat and rich off of his ill gotten gain because Mr Feathersmith just had to sell those deed Ms Devlin hasn really done anything She just replaced one greedy millionaire with another If you watch the episode from Mr Feathersmith perspective he learned a lesson But if you watch the episode from Hecate perspective the exact opposite is true He hasn learned a thing about greed He just a much of a jerk a Mr Feathersmith and he got that way because of Ms Devlin Here something else to think about what if Mr Hecate get bored with being rich Would he wander down to the elevator into Ms Devlin travel office then make the same mistake and end up having to sell HIS bond back to Mr Feathersmith to get back to his won time Would they end up selling the deed off to one another in a kind of infinite loop forever trading place Has a lesson really been learned or ha Ms Devlin set off an inevitable chain of event where they perpetually grow tired of their rich go back make a mistake and give their fortune to the other Who can say The message of the episode seems to be that rich people only become rich because of coincidence but Ms Devlin is no coincidence She orchestrated the whole thing Who know if the event portrayed in the episode are really the beginning of it all What if there were infinite janitor Feathersmiths and infinite millionaire Hecates before what we see And after too It boggles the mind You really have to put this into perspective At the beginning of the story Mr Feathersmith is going to Hell no matter what Ms Devlin say so because he lived a vicious mean spirited life and he ha to pay cash instead of his soul But by making them reverse role won Mr Hecate go to Hell And won Mr Feathersmith the nice kindly janitor go up to the Pearly Gates for having 40 year of service and gaining his gold watch in the process The ending of the episode might seem sad but really Mr Feathersmith is the winner because clearly the world of the episode ha some notion of Heaven and Hell Does Ms Devlin think that Mr Feathersmith ha suffered enough trying to convince the two Cliffordville mechanic that they can build a motor only to have them laugh in his face It doesn seem like the Devil would have too much compassion for a protagonist a loathsome a Feathersmith But what she done essentially by messing up time is given Mr Hecate a spot in Hell because of Mr Feathersmith foolish choice to travel backward into time and she given Mr Feathersmith an undeserved spot in Heaven that ignores his action before he gave Mr Hecate the deed back It seems a if he loses but he really doe win in the end because he no longer a jerk Here how I think the episode could have ended a little better Let say that Mr Feathersmith make a fool of himself back at the turn of the century He goof around He becomes a laughing stock among the townsfolk and nobody will give him a decent job even if he begs for it He declared a lunatic and get thoroughly ostracized by the member of his community In the end he become destitute and ha to eat scrap off the road He lost and he won ever regain his fortune and not only that but he living in the wrong time with no Ms Devlin in sight The end See No alteration in Hecate life just his own Hecate let say decides to be a janitor like he did before and work for a similar millionaire but this millionaire is le harsh a bit more forgiving le cutthroat kinder to his hard working employee It could even be Mr Dietrich Feathersmith chief competitor in the present timeline just for the sake of argument Hecate doesn end up making a complete fortune but he end up in the middle class with a decent janitor income and a great family Feathersmith remains poor get into drinking and commits suicide and still go to Hell Now THERE S a good ending Justice is given out Nobody switch place but the ending is satisfying and all the piece of the puzzle are put in place Less sloppy There are still a few minor detail of this episode worth going over For one Mr Feathersmith is a little too calm when Ms Devlin take off her hat and reveals her two horn she doesn even try to act casual about it and he isn even bothered in the least I also wonder why Mr Feathersmith would give up his two deed just to be back in the present day he went back to Cliffordville for the rustic nostalgic charm so couldn he keep the deed and make his fortune in some other way He could work a a fry cook until a better oil drill is developed in fact that why Hecate becomes a millionaire at the end because he wa more patient and hung on to the deed until a suitable time There are more way to gain wealth than just by buying an oil field and if Mr Feathersmith wa going to build up his money in the exact same way then why go at all If he not even going to put a little creativity into it why not just stay in the present He also apparently rather go back to the present day where he older than stay in the past and be optimistic about his situation I mean he give up his worldly possession just to go back to the sixty What so great about the sixty Sure they had better medicine and stuff but also more pollution and le opportunity to make money which is why Mr Feathersmith went back in time to begin with The last gripe I have with the episode is the way in which Ms Devlin trick Mr Feathersmith He say he want to look the same when he go back into the past so she make him look the same but she keep his real age the same so he still old and far le agile It supposed to be a loophole I know and it meant to prove that The Devil always find a loophole somewhere but she say that his inside are the same and only his outside are different Who to say where the outside end and the inside begin Are his teeth still rotted What if he went to the local Cliffordville doctor He be treated a a medical anomaly Apart from that this is a good episode The makeup is superb the actor are terrific and wholly believable and it an interesting way to handle the whole time travel concept These are some problem I have with it Can you answer themOf Late I Think About The Episode About Cliffordville

1020,Iamnotthethe,1,OK so you all know this one right Archibald Beechcroft antisocial introvert hate everybody and everything His annoying acquaintance Henry give him a book about how people can do thing through the power of suggestion He take the book and try to use it and make all the people in the world vanish in a poof But then he get really bored sitting alone with nobody to talk to So he think Hey if there wa a world full of ME that would be great But then everybody in that world is just a antisocial a he is so he restores the world back to the way it wa There just one titchy problem

1046,Iamnotthethe,1,The Hunt is a bad episode Not just bad it fails in pretty much every department I can relate to the protagonist the plot is cliche and furthermore it just doesn make any sense Allow me to give you a brief overview This hillbilly life with his wife in a little cabin and he a hunting maniac so he go out into the forest one night with his dog He dy but doesn realize it somehow and then he go back to his cabin and find that he become an invisible ghost He never try to pick anything up and signal to anybody that he there and he so dense that for five minute or so he can tell that he dead even though he see his own grave being dug After this he venture off into the wood again and come across an eternal fence which serf a the entrance to the afterlife He see a gate and the guy at the gate say that it lead into Heaven and that he can come in and that there nothing else outside the gate The hillbilly decides not to enter because they don allow dog and he ha his dog with him He go further on and find a second gate and there an angel there who say that the first gate wa actually Hell that THIS one is Heaven and that he can come in with his dog and live there happily ever after Now here the flaw The devil LIES The devil lie That my problem with this one The Devil say that HELL is HEAVEN I don think he should be allowed to do that I think that God should give him a good going over Think about how twisted this situation is for a moment If that guy hadn brought his dog with him he would have been burned up for all eternity EVEN THOUGH HE HADN T SINNED WHEN HE WAS ALIVE Is it just me or is that unjust There are lot of evil people in the world doe Satan really need to TRICK people into being burnt up I don think he should do that I think Satan need to have some limit Take for example the hour long episode where Burgess Meredith is Satan He probably the best Satan in the whole series He devious and cunning and he light crooked cigar with his finger Consider the scene where Pengy try to get the owner of the newspaper to sign his soul over with a contract The contract is very blunt It say in plain lettering that the guy is supposed to give Burgess his soul in exchange for good newspaper story There no beating around the bush Burgess doe try to deny his being the Devil I admit but he also admits that if the guy doesn sign the contract then there nothing he can do about it he just leave and the guy will be alone again People have to make deal with the Devil willingly or the Devil is a cheater Very simple really God ha put certain restriction certain limitation on the Devil to ensure that he doesn catch anybody off guard Satan cannot lie and his victim have to be OK with it Burgess Meredith fulfills that description perfectly He actually believable a the Devil Not so with the guy in The Hunt Now I have to ask you why would Satan lie to the poor hillbilly guy I don think Satan is entitled to do that It would be OK maybe if Satan said This is Hell yeah but it really isn a bad a people make it out to be it really very fun Then if the hillbilly guy entered the gate THEN Satan would be allowed to burn him up I think for falling for it But Satan just flat out LIES And that wrong What sort of crumby afterlife allows Hell to disguise itself a Heaven and then punish people who did nothing Heck what can be certain What if the Heaven at the end the second gate is really Hell How doe this afterlife work Why doe Satan get to do that I think that God should I dunno discus some ground rule with Satan here and tell him that coaxing innocent people into his gate is a no no Seriously I just don get this episode Why doe Satan get to do this Can anybody explain it,I don like The Hunt,The Hunt is a bad episode Not just bad it fails

1073,Iamnotthethe,1,This seems to be a fan favorite among most and I used to like it but I always felt like something wa a little off about it Now I know what wrong with it As a kid I accepted it without questioning it passing it off a a simple story about an alien invasion with a killer punchline Now though I know just how corny and awful it is It a good episode in it own right but trust me once you see the source material you get why I hate it I saw a book a while back called The Best of Damon Knight It wa from 1976 and I usually don buy sci fi book but I noticed it had about 20 different story in there so I got it There wa an introduction about this guy Damon Knight and he wa born in Oregon I guess and he open each story with a small introduction and then go on The story I noticed were very satirical in nature Which is to say they were allegory not intended to be taken seriously I noticed that one of them wa called To Serve Man I wa intrigued I thought maybe it had something to do with the Twilight Zone episode As it turn out it doe Rod Serling ripped the story wholesale off this poor guy Sure he paid him so it legal but he messed up the core message of the whole thing The story beat the episode in a lot of way For one the story is funny Dark humor sure but humor nonetheless Damon Knight wrote lot of funny and inventive sci fi story They all just big joke Backward O Time is so funny it should be made into a comedy movie Anyway the episode is treated so heavy handed that when trying to discern the true meaning of the whole thing I thought it wa a metaphor for Communism Turns out it not a metaphor for Communism it really just a story about alien that cook people according to Damon Knight In To Serve Man the story the Kanamits look like pig And it funny and it make a statement because you know pig eating people Funny right As a metter of fact on the cover of my Damon Knight book there a drawing of two Kanamits looking at a book written in some ancient language presumably and they look like they were taken out of a cartoon with Teletubbie type overall In the episode they aren even slightly laughable in appearance Instead of being little pig people they tall morbid guy that look like Lurch from The Addams Family Their image a it wa supposed to be wa ruined forever by this one show The next thing that get me is the character In the episode there a guy and he work for the United Nations Same with the story But in the story he a bachelor In the episode he ha a girlfriend a love interest who completely unnecessary her only reason is to say the punchline at the end In the story he ha this friend And this friend I think is absolutely essential In the story the friend talk about how he suspect that the Kanamits have ulterior motif and how nobody would solve all world hunger and war if they didn want something in return This one friend of the protagonist make the story a lot more believable In the episode they don even bother to check the Kanamits out They just go right ahead and start letting them fix everything This friend in the story who completely absent in the episode give a different viewpoint and show that in a case like this where freakin ALIENS arrive on Earth some people would be skeptical about them In the episode they don even make a fuss That friend make everything more realistic MOST of the human race can be stupid and give in just not ALL And the ending bug me In the story when the friend say the punchline they not about to abducted and captured they talking thing over in a restaurant so they still have time to stop the alien and get their planet back In the episode his love interest say the punchline when they close the door over him and he dy no matter what In the story you nervously chuckle In the episode you just groan In short the Twilight Zone is normally praised for it inventive twist and people always seem to really praise the twist in this one although that praise isn deserved since Rod Serling never even came up with it to begin with I highly prefer the Damon Knight version and I suggest you read it too and see which one you prefer It a good twist but Damon Knight came up with it and he should have been able to execute it the way he saw fit That all I have to say,I don like To Serve Man,This seems to be a fan favorite among most and I used to like it but I

1074,Iamnotthethe,1,This episode is highly overrated Everybody know it It regarded a a pioneer of the post apocalyptic genre and an episode with a stunning never to be expected twist But what I don like about it is that it doesn make any sense and nobody seems to get that First off I love Burgess Meredith I have nothing against him His acting in this is great Top notch I liked him in the one where he holed up in his apartment and he forced to die because he like book That one great He also good a Penguin He actually the only villain I like on Batman His rendition of Penguin is incredible Best Penguin portrayal ever I don like Danny DeVito He just can beat Burgy So this review isn directed towards Burgess It based on the plot WE open the episode in a bank where Burgess is reading a book His bos come up and say that he stink a a person and he shouldn read so much David Copperfield He tell him that he suck at his job and if he keep reading dumb book then he be fired After that he go home and try to relax but his vain screaming wife tell him that his book suck She vandalizes them throw them in the trash tear the page out He begs her not to but she mentally assault him and threatens to get a divorce So then Mr Bemis like any sane person would do go down to the bank vault to read alone away from the jerk who pick on him for being a nerdy literary guy The bomb go off and he go outside and he think Oh wow I free from my stupid bos and my nagging wife Yay So he go around in the rubble and he get to a library and he about to read forever and enjoy his life forever and then he break his glass That it End of episode Fade to black What people fail to notice is that the moral is HORRIBLY SKEWED The whole episode I feel nothing but pity for him Why do his glass break That not justice that frickin torture What is the moral That a guy can read book peacefully if he want to That he should have been NICE to his fat bos and his evil yelling wife That he should have been a soulless conformist This episode is just sad The episode should just end when his wife and bos get killed there Justice served The moral could be Don be mean to poor Burgess Meredith when he just want to read Can he be an introvert if he want to be an introvert Nope I don get the moral here I don get it The Obsolete man the other one he in praise the use of book This one seems to be anti book That pretty contradictory Here how I think the whole episode could be improved They made his wife and bos complete jerk and made him a sweet completely likeable sympathetic character If they were going to make the moral that he shouldn have been such a bookworm then that fine They just need to make HIM the bad guy Maybe his bos could have said that the business wa failing that he had built the bank out of the ground with his bare hand and Bemis is so lost in his book that he worth a much a a statue Then Mr Bemis could throw the book in his bos face and say F you The episode doesn make him a jerk It make him a cuddly nerd In the next scene his wife could come home and beg for him to pay a little more attention to her and he could push her aside and go over to his armchair and read and not listen to her and be a total asshat That would give a reason for him to break his glass But freak she a likable and charismatic a Norman Bates I don sympathize with HER I sympathize with HIM That what this episode doe wrong People bully this guy and then he get Justice for no reason I don get it Also the problem isn even THAT bad It seems incredibly easy to fix Earlier in the episode he find an abandoned gas station find some potato chip crunch one and say I won starve COULDN T HE FIND SOME GLASSES Some glass that were shatter resistant or in good packaging Or he could go and find some crazy glue and try to fix his glass I mean they just glass They probably not the last glass on Earth if he could find some potato chip he could feel around for some glass RIGHT Anyway that all I have to say about this one I just don get it,I don like Time Enough at Last,This episode is highly overrated Everybody know it It regarded a a pioneer of the post apocalyptic genre and an episode with a stunning never to be expected twist But what I don like about it is that it doesn make any sense and nobody seems to get that First off I love Burgess Meredith I have nothing against him His acting in this is great Top notch I liked him in the one where he holed up in his apartment and he forced to die because he like book That one great He also good a Penguin He actually the only villain I like on Batman His rendition of Penguin is incredible Best Penguin portrayal ever I don like Danny DeVito He just can beat Burgy So this review isn directed towards Burgess It based on the plot WE open the episode in a bank where Burgess is reading a book His bos come up and say that he stink a a person and he shouldn read so much David Copperfield He tell him that he suck at his job and if he keep reading dumb book then he be fired After that he go home and try to relax but his vain screaming wife tell him that his book suck She vandalizes them throw them in the trash tear the page out He begs her not to but she mentally assault him and threatens to get a divorce So then Mr Bemis like any sane person would do go down to the bank vault to read alone away from the jerk who pick on him for being a nerdy literary guy The bomb go off and he go outside and he think Oh wow I free from my stupid bos and my nagging wife Yay So he go around in the rubble and he get to a library and he about to read forever and enjoy his life forever and then he break his glass That it End of episode Fade to black What people fail to notice is that the moral is HORRIBLY SKEWED The whole episode I feel nothing but pity for him Why do his glass break That not justice that frickin torture What is the moral That a guy can read book peacefully if he want to That he should have been NICE to his fat bos and his evil yelling wife That he should have been a soulless conformist This episode is just sad The episode should just end when his wife and bos get killed there Justice served The moral could be Don be mean to poor Burgess Meredith when he just want to read Can he be an introvert if he want to be an introvert Nope I don get the moral here I don get it The Obsolete man the other one he in praise the use of book This one seems to be anti book That pretty contradictory Here how I think the whole episode could be improved They made his wife and bos complete jerk and made him a sweet completely likeable sympathetic character If they were going to make the moral that he shouldn have been such a bookworm then that fine They just need to make HIM the bad guy Maybe his bos could have said that the business wa failing that he had built the bank out of the ground with his bare hand and Bemis is so lost in his book that he worth a much a a statue Then Mr Bemis could throw the book in his bos face and say F you The episode doesn make him a jerk It make him a cuddly nerd In the next scene his wife could come home and beg for him to pay a little more attention to her and he could push her aside and go over to his armchair and read and not listen to her and be a total asshat That would give a reason for him to break his glass But freak she a likable and charismatic a Norman Bates I don sympathize with HER I sympathize with HIM That what this episode doe wrong People bully this guy and then he get Justice for no reason I don get it Also the problem isn even THAT bad It seems incredibly easy to fix Earlier in the episode he find an abandoned gas station find some potato chip crunch one and say I won starve COULDN T HE FIND SOME GLASSES Some glass that were shatter resistant or in good packaging Or he could go and find some crazy glue and try to fix his glass I mean they just glass They probably not the last glass on Earth if he could find some potato chip he could feel around for some glass RIGHT Anyway that all I have to say about this one I just don get itI don like Time Enough at Last

1076,Iamnotthethe,1,I caught some flack for this little series of rant about episode I don like but I willing to keep going so keep your shirt on a I tell you just how this episode fails Everybody seems to like this one and I tend to question unanimous decision Some have even gone so far a to call this one the best episode of ALL TIME like this guy here who put it at the top of his top 10 list http www youtube com watch v X2kOSuz2VZM To begin the concept is brilliant very brilliant Kudos to the TZ people for coming up with a concept like this It wa desperately needed at a time when beauty wa highly overrated and most magazine ad were for beauty product I just think it wa poorly executed is all The makeup is good the dialogue is good My problem with the episode I guess depends on the way it wa executed I start off with the most obvious problem when running a story like this Namely the problem is that none of the doctor or nurse can show their face You might think that this seems rather obvious a their face have to stay hidden until the big reveal And it true their face DO have to stay hidden And that right there is the problem We never see their face until they get revealed That why this episode isn very good WE a an audience know something is WRONG with their face Even if we never seen the episode before we KNOW that something is being hidden that there must be some REASON for obscuring their face No other Twilight Zone episode ha all the character walk around with their face obscured in shadow That why I feel the twist doesn work Good twist have to take you by surprise Like the one with the guy on the boat who the good version of the evil Nazi guy and he try to warn everybody on the ship but they all ghost and so on That one ha a good twist Or the one with the guy who can stop time with his watch but break the watch when he robbing a bank Those are good twist Or the one where the guy asks the psychic salesman for too many thing and he give him a set of shoe and he get run over by them THOSE are good twist You never see them coming This one though you can see a twiss of some kind involving their face from a mile away It would ruin the twist to show their face but it ruin the twist to hide their face too It a loss either way That the problem with this story A few more problem Before the big reveal the script ha to fill about a half an hour so the doctor and the nurse talk about thing for a while The problem with their dialogue is that it isn even very subtle We supposed to assume that the hospital is just a normal hospital treating a lady with some kind of facial disfigurement But there are lot of point in the doctor dialogue where we feel like something is a little off Like for instance the doctor say I wish these ugly people could just live among u And the nurse say Oh no don say that you be accused of treason Right from those two line a bright viewer will catch that not only are people not ALLOWED to be ugly in this world but FREE SPEECH is illegal and you can THINK about progress or nonconformity This is clearly an Orwellian society and I just don know why when a plot relies so heavily on the viewer perceiving the hospital a a normal hospital there are so many dead giveaway Another dead giveaway come when the nurse say It time for the LEADER S MANDATORY SPEECH Not the PRESIDENT even just the LEADER Doesn that sound a lot like Big Brother Only an idiot would think that the place is a normal hospital at this point Then the nurse push a button and this HOLOGRAPHIC VIEWING SCREEN pop up on the wall Not a normal TV no but a HOLOGRAPHIC VIEWING SCREEN This is clearly in the future We can see everything from a mile away maybe before the big reveal they could just talk about I dunno normal doctor stuff That would hide the fact that the hospital isn a normal hospital My last problem with this episode might seem a little picky but it one line in the script The Nurse is in the room and she talking to the lady with the facial disfigurement and the lady say Nurse how much longer do I have to go around looking like a PIG Now this seems normal it a common insult for an ugly person But think about it for a moment EVERY PERSON in this society look a lot like a PIG It doesn matter that the pig people are considered beautiful Regardless of what the standard of beauty are at this particular moment I think even most Pig People would agree that THEY LOOK MORE LIKE PIGS THAN THE NORMAL PEOPLE So PIG therefore would be a COMPLIMENT not an INSULT I don know what to make of this line It confuses everything Do PIGS look like HUMANS in this world Who know The scriptwriter should have been more careful with what the character said is all Anyway that what I have to say about this episode It could have been good if they had put a little more thought into it Good message I like the message and the twist and the moral Just need some work,I don like Eye of the Beholder,I caught some flack for this little series of rant

1079,Iamnotthethe,1,I heard that some people hate this one I not sure their hatred is meaningful however It is one of my all time favorite episode and I think I might be able to shed a little light on why I favor it so much First off it a very creative way of dealing with the whole time travel thing I think it should be put in the top 10 list of all the time travel TV episode The turn of the century wa a time when time travel wa just starting to be accepted a a novel concept so taking a man from 1890 and placing him in 1960 is a neat idea Sure the time machine look nut but that because in 1890 thing were made out of cardboard and tape Mulligan is a fellow who forced to cope with the present and he cope with it in the most hilarious way possible The realism If I saw the first part I couldn tell it wasn a real movie Rod Serling made this at a time before silent movie software wa available and he doe a good job of it The soundtrack is good too changing just at the right moment to give just the right feeling The way in which the format is played around with are creative too when Mulligan blow on the harmonica and fall into the pig pen in particular And let not forget the tremendous effort that were made to make a street look like it came from 1890 they bought chicken and penny farthing to make it look top notch Heck they even bought sign When he go to 1960 the format change and you feel all the wind knocked out of you Then it switch back and you get a rush of nostalgia The gag This episode isn like a normal Twilight Zone episode and that a good thing because it provides a dose of comic relief to contrast with the gritty dark feeling of the other one What I think most critic of this episode don get is that The Twilight Zone isn meant to be a horror show It just a bunch of moral dilemma played out for fun What if scenario Normal people put into weird kooky situation This is an episode where your Average Joe is put into a weird situation and reacts to it he just reacts to it in a more humorous way This is not a scary episode so don look at it a a scary episode Look at it a funny and it seem better I like how Mulligan see the sign and notice that inflation a reality I like how he talk to the TV when he see it If you don like it then you looking for dark theme where there are none Buster for one Buster Keaton is a master of the art and in this episode in his elderly age he display his talent It like watching new Adam Sandler movie 15 year since he made another one I bet the viewer enjoyed it They could have just hired anybody to play the grumpy janitor but they got HIM Do you know what this episode wa like It wa like the new Star Wars It quirky but it golden It the story of a guy who wasn content enough with his own time and then decided that he hated the future even more it funny If you hate it then you never gotten a good kick out of anything before,In defense of Once Upon A Time,I heard that some people hate this one I not

1089,Iamnotthethe,1,I heard a lot about trying to discern what the best ever Twilight Zone episode That what I consider an impossible feat because they all competent But I a critic and I seen a few which bear scrutinization After running them all over in my head I think I discovered the worst ever Twilight Zone episode ever produced Tell me if you agree The worst episode I referring to of course is episode 7 of season 3 The Grave If you watch it once you might think it wa a masterpiece but you know why I think it a piece of garbage It ripped off an urban legend that been played out through the year a gazillion time I watch The Twilight Zone because each and every plot is original Rod mind wa a whirling powerhouse of inventive twist and allegory and so on Before the Twilight Zone wa made There wa no story about a lady who get a call from her dead son or a suburban neighborhood that turn grotesque after a phony bomb threat And I can accept the corny one like the one where Burgess Meredith get the power of super strength from a two headed alien or the dark gritty one like the one about the man who take three of his enemy down to his basement and try to test their cowardice But I can stand this one episode because Rod put no effort into it He looked in a book of scary ghost story picked this one out and thought Heck I do this That why this one get me The urban legend that this one rip off is a classic that everyone know but it can be set in a variety of setting and it can be claimed a fact even though it happens under impossible circumstance For some unexplained reason Rod decided to set it in the Old West although to be honest he could have just a easily set in on Neptune Not that his Old West one aren good I like when The Twilight Zone take a jaunt out to the desert It wa a neat way to connect with the most popular genre of the time the Western and Rod really wa pretty creative with all of it Showdown with Rance McGrew in particular is a real laugh fest and I like it because it dared to question the historical accuracy of the old showdown show I hate this episode though Rod thought that by switching the setting to the Old West he could make it seem original and by putting in some cheap character and a decent script he could escape cancellation But I can see through it all and every time I watch this episode I like Roddy a little le He could have thought up something mediocre that week just so long a he didn put this sleaze on the air No creativity really We open the episode by hearing that there been a big showdown in the town and Pinto Sykes the vicious outlaw ha been killed This is tricky deceitful way to open It sound intriguing and the viewer think something interesting is going to happen Soon a beefcake enters the local saloon on a spooky night of course we can hear the wind blowing all SPOOKILY outside just to tell u that it all CREEPY Right So this guy come in and they shoot the work for a while chat it up over a few shot of whiskey Really this part is just filler I say that the original urban legend could be told in it entirety in about two minute but of course Rod ha to stretch it out for half an hour so they talk about what a jerk Pinto wa and how his death is controversial and whatnot It saddens me to think that they wasted time writing a script for this If it had an original plot this patter might be necessary After a while we get to the part where the rip off really begin One of the guy say Hey if yore really a tuff cowboy like ya sez ya are then go down to thet thar grave an stick this hyar knife inta his grave Or something like that The tough beefcake cowboy of course accepts the bet and go down to the graveyard On the way he encounter this weird lady who there for no reason she talk more ominously than Morticia in The Addams family and I guess she the relative of Pinto or something like that So the cowboy go down there and he try to stick the knife down and he doe but then when he try to walk away he fall down pulled by some unseen force and then the camera cut back to the saloon The cowboy realize that Mr Hunk Cowboy hasn come back yet so they go down to the grave and check it out He dead Like in the original urban legend one of the cowboy point down to the corpse and say that the guy had stuck the knife into his coat by mistake and when he got up and felt the knife tuck in his coat he thought it wa the dead guy hand pulling on him and he had a heart attack and died Same explanation I heard so many time that I gotten tired of it by now Then in one last desperate attempt to make the episode original the creepy lady point out that the WIND wa blowing last night so that his coat wouldn have been over the grave and the wind is still the same way tonight and so it WAS the dead guy after all OOOOOOH Except for the fact that the wind easily could have shifted at any point during the night and it the weakest point that anybody could have come up with This is Rod trying at the last minute to make it more interesting but it so pathetic that it end up being tiresome and pointless The original urban legend to begin with ha so many plotholes that it doesn make for a good Twilight Zone episode If a person ha the gut to enter a fricking graveyard and stick a knife into a grave then they probably won have a heart attack when they feel a little tugging on their coat Wouldn somebody be able to tell the difference between a knife and a fricking DEAD HAND Anyway this episode is very poorly done and it make me sad to see Rod resorting to something a cheap a this If you don read the urban legend first it seems OK but it loses it value the minute you realize just how hackneyed it is I thought I like to tell you about this episode so you won make the error of watching it like I did for some reason Tell me what you think of it,Worst episode,I heard a lot about trying to discern what the best ever Twilight Zone episode That what I consider an impossible feat because they all competent But I a critic and I seen a few which bear scrutinization After running them all over in my head I think I discovered the worst ever Twilight Zone episode ever produced Tell me if you agree The worst episode I referring to of course is episode 7 of season 3 The Grave If you watch it once you might think it wa a masterpiece but you know why I think it a piece of garbage It ripped off an urban legend that been played out through the year a gazillion time I watch The Twilight Zone because each and every plot is original Rod mind wa a whirling powerhouse of inventive twist and allegory and so on Before the Twilight Zone wa made There wa no story about a lady who get a call from her dead son or a suburban neighborhood that turn grotesque after a phony bomb threat And I can accept the corny one like the one where Burgess Meredith get the power of super strength from a two headed alien or the dark gritty one like the one about the man who take three of his enemy down to his basement and try to test their cowardice But I can stand this one episode because Rod put no effort into it He looked in a book of scary ghost story picked this one out and thought Heck I do this That why this one get me The urban legend that this one rip off is a classic that everyone know but it can be set in a variety of setting and it can be claimed a fact even though it happens under impossible circumstance For some unexplained reason Rod decided to set it in the Old West although to be honest he could have just a easily set in on Neptune Not that his Old West one aren good I like when The Twilight Zone take a jaunt out to the desert It wa a neat way to connect with the most popular genre of the time the Western and Rod really wa pretty creative with all of it Showdown with Rance McGrew in particular is a real laugh fest and I like it because it dared to question the historical accuracy of the old showdown show I hate this episode though Rod thought that by switching the setting to the Old West he could make it seem original and by putting in some cheap character and a decent script he could escape cancellation But I can see through it all and every time I watch this episode I like Roddy a little le He could have thought up something mediocre that week just so long a he didn put this sleaze on the air No creativity really We open the episode by hearing that there been a big showdown in the town and Pinto Sykes the vicious outlaw ha been killed This is tricky deceitful way to open It sound intriguing and the viewer think something interesting is going to happen Soon a beefcake enters the local saloon on a spooky night of course we can hear the wind blowing all SPOOKILY outside just to tell u that it all CREEPY Right So this guy come in and they shoot the work for a while chat it up over a few shot of whiskey Really this part is just filler I say that the original urban legend could be told in it entirety in about two minute but of course Rod ha to stretch it out for half an hour so they talk about what a jerk Pinto wa and how his death is controversial and whatnot It saddens me to think that they wasted time writing a script for this If it had an original plot this patter might be necessary After a while we get to the part where the rip off really begin One of the guy say Hey if yore really a tuff cowboy like ya sez ya are then go down to thet thar grave an stick this hyar knife inta his grave Or something like that The tough beefcake cowboy of course accepts the bet and go down to the graveyard On the way he encounter this weird lady who there for no reason she talk more ominously than Morticia in The Addams family and I guess she the relative of Pinto or something like that So the cowboy go down there and he try to stick the knife down and he doe but then when he try to walk away he fall down pulled by some unseen force and then the camera cut back to the saloon The cowboy realize that Mr Hunk Cowboy hasn come back yet so they go down to the grave and check it out He dead Like in the original urban legend one of the cowboy point down to the corpse and say that the guy had stuck the knife into his coat by mistake and when he got up and felt the knife tuck in his coat he thought it wa the dead guy hand pulling on him and he had a heart attack and died Same explanation I heard so many time that I gotten tired of it by now Then in one last desperate attempt to make the episode original the creepy lady point out that the WIND wa blowing last night so that his coat wouldn have been over the grave and the wind is still the same way tonight and so it WAS the dead guy after all OOOOOOH Except for the fact that the wind easily could have shifted at any point during the night and it the weakest point that anybody could have come up with This is Rod trying at the last minute to make it more interesting but it so pathetic that it end up being tiresome and pointless The original urban legend to begin with ha so many plotholes that it doesn make for a good Twilight Zone episode If a person ha the gut to enter a fricking graveyard and stick a knife into a grave then they probably won have a heart attack when they feel a little tugging on their coat Wouldn somebody be able to tell the difference between a knife and a fricking DEAD HAND Anyway this episode is very poorly done and it make me sad to see Rod resorting to something a cheap a this If you don read the urban legend first it seems OK but it loses it value the minute you realize just how hackneyed it is I thought I like to tell you about this episode so you won make the error of watching it like I did for some reason Tell me what you think of itWorst episode

1220,Ace76inDC,1,This really happened The wife had a bad night of sleep and woke me up at about 2am the day before Halloween about two week ago and you know how you remember dream clearly if you wake up suddenly That happened to me Here the weird part my dream wa a complete full length black and white version of the 1960s Twilight Zone Not a dream about an episode that I seen but rather a brand new episode concocted entirely by my subconscious Almost right away the next morning I started telling people about it and my wife in particular encouraged me to write it down I didn wake up in the middle of the episode and decided to finish it I dreamt the whole damn thing start to finish And wa woken up at the exact moment it ended My dream had Nazis in it I going to write about Nazis f you think for a minute I condone Nazis or hate you are dead wrong and I think my value are pretty well reflected by my dream Before you react to this post please read to the very end If you are a Nazi or a racist and you feel a need to reply don I ignore you and your dead ideology They say men don dream dialogue but woman do I can say either way I don recall distinct word or conversation just mostly thought scene and concept I did embellish my dream with the opening and closing narrative Rod Serling style that match my impression in the dream of knowing the setting and implication of the story I also made up a title to match my dream I also heard that men dream in black and white Not too sure about that since I had colorful dream This dream though wa completely black and white just like the old Twilight Zone series I don think a story like this would hold up today But compared to Twilight Zone episode which I since researched I never saw them before my dream like Death Head Revisited and He Alive I think it hold up pretty well I have seen plenty of Star Trek story with Nazis in them This story is similar to Man in a High Castle but not in a contemporary sense everyone in my dream really talked and acted like they did in the original Twilight Zone I also not a writer I an engineer I have no idea how to write a screenplay So I write this a an outline like a Wikipedia episode summary Oh and I apologize this isn a particularly scary Twilight Zone even though I dreamt it up pretty close to Halloween Here it go Living History Opening Scene An outdoor museum similar to Gettysburg in Pennsylvania with wood fencing horse and people in costume and school child bustling about But the camera pull back and reveal tank Nazi flag soldier and statue Visitors child and staff alike wearing Nazi armband Opening Narration Picture an America a lovely field in Pennsylvania but not an America or the Pennsylvania we know today No this America succumbed to the Nazi horde in the Second World War and now life a a subjugated people of the far larger empire of the Third Reich and the bitter memory of this war have long faded In this America lie a museum a living history museum on the site of the last battle of that conflict where her last hope wa extinguished The visitor to this museum come from far and wide to learn about the Master Race victory over the feeble democracy loving Allies What the visitor worker and administrator of this museum will soon come to find out some candle and flame cannot be so easily extinguished in the Twilight Zone Plot Summary The museum is in full swing on a busy day Located somewhere in Pennsylvania the staff put on a show for visitor like a living history museum There are horse ride tank fake uniform and weapon and a few old fashioned wood fence near some WWII trench There is even a pit where Nazi child can come and stomp on an American Flag and several are there stomping away with many more lined up behind them note no it kind of doesn make sense that a horse would be in a WWII museum but there wa definitely a horse in my dream and played a big role The museum staff is quite large with quite a few worker but the Nazi administrator are pretty bored and disinterested except when they are giving order The museum really isn being run all that well Nazis clearly looking forward to the future and not spending much time keeping the place up The horse ride is a disaster the road to the museum is a mess and the place is generally completely run down Our story start with a person I felt wa an Affable American Loser He didn get a name in my dream so I call him AL for short He is the youngest and lowliest member of the staff in charge of horse ride When the supervisor aren around he make all sort of joke with his fellow staff who advise him to keep it down or else he get in trouble A Nazi Supervisor an American but in a Nazi uniform is dressing him down for not following order to give all the child ride before the day is over He complains that the horse is overworked and hasn had enough hay and water The Nazi supervisor isn having it He becomes outraged denies Al request for more hay and water and insists that he fill his ride quota a ordered He explains or shout that he ha been ordered to maintain the museum in an orderly and efficient manner in accordance with the tenet of National Socialism There is a grand inspection tomorrow evening and he insists everything be working at peak efficiency or else With that he stomp off That evening when putting the horse away Al get separated from his other worker and discovers a back door to the prop and supply room normally off limit He pause to admire a Nazi general uniform In the supply room he find a basket of apple and secret them out near the kid horse ride area The next day Al ha his horse ride operation running at peak efficiency thanks to the apple he is secretly feeding his horse The Nazi Supervisor come by and note the better operation He still hold a grudge from yesterday debacle and move on without acknowledging Al work After he leaf a messenger arrives with a message for the Nazi Supervisor The messenger state that the head Nazi General administrator ha been delayed for several day Al being mischievous tell the messenger he a trusted senior member of the museum staff and he convey the message personally to the Supervisor The messenger leaf and Al pull an apple out of his pocket start juggling it in the air and whistle He clearly isn going to deliver the message That evening Al sneak back into the prop room to get more apple On his way out he again admires the general uniform this time he decides to try it on After putting on a fake mustache and monocle his is nearly completely indistinguishable from his former self But a he is putting on his last goose stepping boot he lean up against a wall that turn out to be a door to a conference room Straightening up he see the Museum and local Nazi administrator all lined up at a conference table Seeing him they snap to attention and salute Heil Hitler After a few stunned moment Al realizes he need to fake his way out of this situation He decides to vent his frustration of working at the museum Note Al fake a pretty good German accent I just can write one that well You call this a museum Look at this place The attraction are barely functional the staff lazy this place is a mess and the road coming in is a disaster This place is a disgrace to National Socialism I order that the road repaired immediately animal fed clean up crew established etc etc I order you to make this place run like a well oiled Nazi machine The Supervisor sputter but sir we have not been ordered before to do any of these thing The General reply Well YOU VE BEEN ORDERED NOW THINK OF WAYS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND GET TO WORK After a few moment of stunned silence Al say DISMISSED At that word the Nazis in the conference room scramble out the door to enact the fake General order Al wait just a bit then hurry back to the prop room to change back a fast a he can He emerges to find the Supervisor barking order at the museum staff empowering them to make a many change a possible Al come out of the prop room just in time The Supervisor start to chastise him for not being at his duty station but the horse come by with a happy child on it back The Supervisor leaf without another note Some of Al fellow museum worker give him knowing glance showing that some of them likely know about Al biggest trick ever A key beat is when the Supervisor insists that the museum staff think for themselves making the museum run more efficiently The Supervisor pause for just a moment not quite understanding the implication of what he is ordering people to do Flash forward a few day the museum is running at it highest efficiency ever The road is fixed people are very happy to be there and the trash is picked up A visible transformation ha occurred Al ha become a leader of this effort and the Nazi American Supervisor ha grown to appreciate him At the museum conference room the gathered Administrators which now include Al himself are congratulating themselves and discussing at great length what else could be fixed Having gotten the museum up and running smoothly they are looking at their surrounding town and village and start making suggestion how to fix them like getting train and bus running on time to allow more visitor to the museum Just then the real German Nazi General show up After the usual saluting and Heil Hitler ing the General launch into a tirade JUST WHAT IS GOING ON WHO GAVE THE ORDERS TO USE RESOURCES TO FIX THE MUSEUM and so on The Nazi American Supervisor speaks up hesitantly Sir we were just following order to make this museum run a efficiently a He get cut off WHO AUTHORIZED YOU TO MAKE THESE CHANGES HOW DARE YOU WORK WITHOUT PROPER ORDERS YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING PROPER NATIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES and he really start sputtering accusation The assembled Administrators glare at the General You know in the way they always seemed to do in the old Twlight Zone show That kind of long 60 glare that would be edited down to 0 02 second in a modern TV show with the horn blaring The Nazi American Supervisor grows a backbone maybe for the first time ever No sir you are wrong We are following proper National Socialist value It is you who are out of line Guards please take the General to the Officer quarter and hold him there They do so the General sputtering the whole way The Supervisor turn to his administrative staff After a moment of careful consideration he speaks Gentlemen I believe what we have learned here at this museum can be a great benefit to the people of the Third Reich There are many inefficiency of how our Government run How do we best spread our technique to the larger country After a rapid discussion the gathered Administrators come to an astonishing conclusion They realize they must take charge of the weapon at the museum bring them back into service and seize the local burgermeister office Then they will be able to implement change to the train bus line food supply quality of life etc The Administrators are absolutely convinced they are acting in the best interest of National Socialism and all excitedly rush to action A revolution ha started But a small detail come up a they are rushing to exit the museum Someone call out how will we distinguish ourselves from the Nazis who have lost their way Some discussion ensues Everyone wear the Nazi armband and everyone ha the same uniform and Nazi flag Then Al standing near the back is lightning struck by an idea He rush over to the flag stomping pit and reach down for the American flag As he grasp the staff of the tattered torn and beat up star and stripe the museum worker and supervisor all gather around and look up to it Just starting to comprehend that they haven been acting in the best interest of National Socialism They been acting in the interest of something else something that ha been forgotten for far too long A faint music play a memory of SCENE Closing Narration The gathered people and staff don quite comprehend what a profound transformation ha happened in their humble worn down and nearly forgotten museum Seeking to enact a more perfect form of National Socialism they have learned it basic intrinsic flaw Human initiative and thought are incompatible with a system that demand strict obedience to order above all else From this modest spark a great fire of freedom ha been kindled For the self evident truth of Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness are just a self evident and just a true even in the darkest corner of the Twilight Zone,The Night Before Halloween I Dreamt a Complete

ha been okay so far But just that OK With a lot of the other connected title There wa this really clever natural way that the various creature and mythological device get explained So even if you are not aware of something in particular you ted it enough to enjoy the story That sort of happens in House of Wispers but not a well It also make it harder to follow when many of the conversation bubble are in creol or French I really do appreciate adding that in there to really make it feel authentic i think thats the right word but it is some time to the point I just feel like I am missing chunk of dialogue thats wa okay though There were some really cool thing going on in the book cool plot point I wa still down There were some social political undertone in the story I wa fine with a lot of it It usualy fit the character made sense or had some relevance to the plot There were a few time though thing just felt like they were there for no reason Didn seem to connect with anything I rolled my eye and kept reading Then the orphan girl and her cat came in the picture In this story arch there a typical orphan with shit surrogate parent with only a cat a a friend The problem with this wa one it wa unclear where this wa happening The parent had a Spanish last name but spoke with British slang Then she run away riding on the back of her now mutated cat friend The cat friend try to eat her but she basically say swiper no swiping and the cat decides to not eat her and help her instead They end up and a closed down immigration facility She make some comment about whatever country she in being a shit hole and it only hope wa the immigrant it shit on that wa blatant I get the character ha been abused But based on her abuse I dont really think she would even be aware of much of the world considering she wa locked up being a servant in these people house for most of her life It just felt like lazy writing and a really loud political comment that wasn even clear what country it wa directed to It felt sloppy House of Whispers ha not been my favorite story in the Sandman Universe It been real it been fun but it hasn been real fun And if sloppy politically charged writing is going to make it way in to an already not spectacular storyline I dont really care to hear the rest of it,First time quitting a series because of political overtone,First off dispite being heavily interested in politics and having strong oppinions on related subject a long a the story I am reading is well done I really dont care about Undertones or jab being thrown in here and there It make thing topical sure but I read comic for a story period If a story is good then I don care if a charater sound like a stereotype you can see on the news Second off I LOVE Neil Gaiman Sandman I love the

160,MaskMakerDollar251,0,Doomsday clock will come out tomorrow 18 12 2019 on store wich will also mark the end of the series event and hopefully will give u the resolution around the state of the time line of the dc universe and in general of dc comic itself having read it to this point I confess that while I liked this story there ha been something that made concerned about I talking about possible spoiler the commedian return and the way he wa brought back from the dead Initially I wasn shacken up by it because I wa hopefull that Geoff Johns would have adress that issue in a way that would have been respectfull to the original work of Alan Moore maybe by making Doctor Manhattan create two separate reality in which one Blake wa saved by him and another where he still died for example But we reaching the end and to this day he still hasn addressed it yet and I worried that he won at all Now I not losing my hope on Geoff Johns just yet after all we still have one issue left and the internet say it will be a long issue My howeve is this based on what he do about it his action will affect Watchmen in term of acceptance from the community based on my subjective interpretation on the subject I think he can settle the issue with the following option Making two different reality a I mentioned at the beginning of the post leave it a it is by which I mean leaving the commedian alive in the dc universe which can still work because the original world of Watchmen will come undone for this but the original story will still exist putting back the commedian where he wa in the fall and erasing his memory of the experience I had to make this last point very clear because is the crux of what I trying to explain the very worst thing that could happen is if the writer decides to put him back to where he wa but with the memory still intact Because that would give Blake something to cheer on before diyng knowing that Ozymandias plan came usunder after his death That would give him hope And hope is the foundation of the Dc universe not of Watchmen Watchmen wa a story set on a world where hero needed to let go of their moral principal their thrust in the system and their hope of a better tomorrow and take the law on their hand to carry their justice on the world doing whatever wa necessary even murdering innocent So putting the concept of hope in a world like this would clash with it atmosphere making the tone inconsistent Not to mention that it would make Ozymandias an actual villain when he wa more like the antagonist of the story he may had killed innocent people but he didn do anything different from what his other collegues did in their career He wa still a hero doing everything he could to save the world The reason why I expressing my concern is not for my sensibility because even if the worst happens I could still treat it like a separate thing same a other older reader What vorries me is that when new reader will give Watchmen a try after they read Doomsday clock while some can treat it a a separate thing like me others will be left confused or won appreaciate the story for what it is which is a deconstruction of the superhero genre becuase Doomsday clock will influence the tone of the story And that all I want to say I don expect to recieve prize for this post since it could be percieved a an unpopular opinion but I hope we can all have a peacefull and respectfull conversation and that I not alone in this,Possibly unpopular opinion I think Doomsday Clock could possibly harm the quality of Watchmen,Doomsday

310,bserum,0,You may be familiar with Tom King suggestion that influential contributor get co creator credit http www cbr com batman tom king creator credit oneil adam englehart rogers miller I kind of agree but I will say that creator too strongly implies originator which can lead to misinterpretation and confusion Instead I nominate defined by a a suitably reverent and all inclusive term Thus in Tom King example gt Batman defined by Bob Kane Bill Finger Denny O Neil Neal Adams Steve Englehart Marshall Rogers and Frank Miller But whereas the traditional method of identifying authorship is fairly straightforward whoever name are on the credit page of a character first appearance King asks for a more nuanced evaluation of credit But this can get complicated and subjective It call into question what constitutes a character in the first place I LOVE this question it one I given some thought to I suggest that a character is defined by 4 distinct facet I made a diagram http images2 imgbox com 84 aa 6d4NL5y7_o jpg Entity Both perfunctory yet integral this refers to the character individual self It is the basic element that make Jack Kirby and Joe Simon Bucky the same character a Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting Winter Soldier Whereas each of the other three trait can change dramatically the continuity of consciousness creates an indelible link to it previous incarnation Design The fundamental visual appearance of a character It the property that allows people who look nothing alike Adam West Michael Keaton Val Kilmer Christian Bale and Ben Affleck to disappear into the iconic entity we recognize a Batman Characterization The personality and attitude of a character defines the choice they make and the way they respond to the world around them Though possessing identical power set the contrast between Plastic Man lighthearted frivolity and Mister Fantastic intellectual seriousness illustrates why character relies on characterization Worldbuilding Transformative event exposure to chemical waste loss of loved one etc and individual element Hell Kitchen a Batmobile Kryptonite etc can become so tightly integrated with a character that they become associated with and an extension of that character So let me apply this to a character like Wolverine Wolverine is an excellent example of a character that ha been developed significantly since he showed up a an antagonist in Incredible Hulk 181 182 He stemmed from a concept by editor in chief designed by Marvel art director fleshed out by a writer who had just a few issue with the character developed dramatically over decade by another writer with a selection of other artist and writer contributing here and there Here is just one guy take on who defined Wolverine with totally arbitrary percentage because I have a OCD urge to quantify everything Chris Claremont 40 Logan name claw a part of body Adamantium reinforced bone healing factor mysterious backstory character development Len Wein 10 mutant animal sens ferocious attitude Government agent John Romita 10 original costume claw John Byrne 10 brown amp tan costume variant advanced age war veteran Alpha Flight Dave Cockrum 5

Frank Miller 4 Japanese samurai background Bob Harras 1 Wolverine 75 writer Larry Hama ha reported that he wa against the idea of bone claw so I guessing it wa X Men editor Harras that conceived it

creates an indelible link to it previous incarnation Design The fundamental visual appearance of a character It the property that allows people who look nothing alike Adam West Michael Keaton Val Kilmer Christian Bale and Ben Affleck to disappear into the iconic entity we recognize a Batman Characterization The personality and attitude of a character defines the choice they make and the way they respond to the world around them Though possessing identical power set the contrast between Plastic Man lighthearted frivolity and Mister Fantastic intellectual seriousness illustrates why character relies on characterization Worldbuilding Transformative event exposure to chemical waste loss of loved one etc and individual element Hell Kitchen a Batmobile Kryptonite etc can become so tightly integrated with a character that they become associated with and an extension of that character So let me apply this to a character like Wolverine Wolverine is an excellent example of a character that ha been developed significantly since he showed up a an antagonist in Incredible Hulk 181 182 He stemmed from a concept by editor in chief designed by Marvel art director fleshed out by a writer who had just a few issue with the character developed dramatically over decade by another writer with a selection of other artist and writer contributing here and there Here is just one guy take on who defined Wolverine with totally arbitrary percentage because I have a OCD urge to quantify everything Chris Claremont 40 Logan name claw a part of body Adamantium reinforced bone healing factor mysterious backstory character development Len Wein 10 mutant animal sens ferocious attitude Government agent John Romita 10 original costume claw John Byrne 10 brown amp tan costume variant advanced age war veteran Alpha Flight Dave Cockrum 5 distinctive hairstyle Gil Kane 5 iconic cowl Barry Windsor Smith 5 Weapon X background Paul Jenkins Joe Quesada Bill Jemas 5 James Howlett name youth background Roy Thomas 5 Wolverine name Canadian Frank Miller 4 Japanese samurai background Bob Harras 1 Wolverine 75 writer Larry Hama ha reported that he wa against the idea of bone claw so I guessing it wa X Men editor Harras that conceived it bone clawInfluential contributor to character should get credit

fictional character all across the board Specifically Marvel and DC And my favorite thing is discovering really obscure character A couple month back I came across El Hombre Araña and while researching it I one problem kept popping up I can speak Spanish Whenever I would discover specific character I would have a hard time picking out their name in article or deep seeded blog and most of the time the name wouldn even be there The only character I wa able to figure out the name of wa Hombre de Hierro the Iron Man Man of Iron Unfortunately I have still not been able to discover the name of these other individual or discover the existence of others So I thought i come here and ask for help I will post picture below with a mild description On a secondary note I have discovered image of a couple page of the Moon Knight Manga and through my research I have uncovered The Moon Knights real name Shingo Tōma There is another character though and it the villain he is fighting a unnamed Kaijin member of the Black Wolf Group I will post him below aswell If there are any other original character or reinvented take on pre existing character in the material above it would be appreciated

412,Cole-Spudmoney,0,I need to rant a little bit about this there a difference between a character popularity among reader and their popularity in universe and it irritates me when comic writer confuse the latter with the former It something that come up in a couple of series that I otherwise really like Geoff Johns run on Aquaman is great it doe a really good job of relaunching the character taking a lot of inspiration from his Silver Age backstory but updated for modern storytelling standard But the character had that whole Aquaman is lame meme following him ever since the Super Friends cartoon so Johns decided to directly reference and refute that in his first issue First time we see Aquaman he stop some criminal making a getaway on the street and they all like Aw man we got stopped by Aquaman That so lame We never live it down Here the thing though in the DC universe no one going to think that Aquaman is lame The Super Friends cartoon doesn exist in this universe and Aquaman is a public figure a Justice League founder and one superhero among many others that have le impressive sounding power than his or no power at all I can easily buy Aquaman being unpopular in universe but that be because he come off a weird or off putting or confusing not because people don take him seriously Another example come from James Robinson Starman with the character Will Payton There one flashback issue set during Will time a Starman which begin with Will doing an internal monologue about how no one seems to like him and also feature a villain doing a long villain speech about how Will suck a a hero because he got no edge Now I have no idea if Will Payton wa an unpopular character or not at the time but I can believe he wa because he wa a genuinely altruistic and wholesome hero who got invented very soon after The Dark Knight Returns established that Comics Are Dark and Serious and For Adults and They Called Graphic Novels Actually Personally I like Will Payton for pretty much the same reason I like Captain America and I think that disliking him because he not edgy is like getting mad at Steve Rogers because he isn Spider Man But again I read all of Roger Stern run on the Starman series with Will and in universe he wasn unpopular For the most part he wa just obscure because he wa a new hero who mostly operated in the city of Phoenix and around the rest of the American southwest and he wa a popular hero among the people who knew about him As I said Robinson Starman is one of my favourite comic series of all time but that whole You unpopular because you have no edge thing doesn feel like something that honestly come from in universe it come off like Robinson using that villain a a mouthpiece to talk about why he himself doe not like Will

475,jordan999fire,0,I feel like story telling wise Marvel DC Image Dark Horse or whoever if they want to start a extended universe or year down the line if they want to do another need to do it via TV Like I use DC for example because that is my favorite comic company If they instead of doing the DCEU gave a huge budget to HBO or another big channel that allows pretty much anything and told them to make a Batman show then after one season of that doing a Superman show etc etc that would benefit way more Than do it similar to the Arrowverse where once a year they all crossover and we have like a Justice League episode Then year in the future all of the show could end at the same time and a new show could start that would be the Justice League I feel like the only benefit movie get is the budget and the audience But if they gave a TV show a really big budget and it had good enough writer to pull in a big audience than we would get 1 More in depth look at the character 2 more world building 3 More character 4 More story Like I don think they could ever do every Robin in a movie universe I think the very minimum of that you could do is 4 movie Batman solo through half the first then getting Dick him having Jason and Dick in the second one but Dick leaving at the end Jason dying at the start of the third one time jump now he ha Tim and fight Red Hood fourth one we hear that Tim ha left Batman and Damian show up but with a show you not only could have every Robin but you could flesh them out you would probably have to make them older like 17 when they start with Batman except Damian This would also benefit villain a lot They could have a lot of reoccurring villain that we end up loving like Gotham did with Riddler Penguin and Jerome Jeremiah and we can have them live up to their comic book counterpart better and actually seem like a threat v something that get dealt with in a few day like in movie Marvel would benefit from this too We could actually have a whole season of Tony Stark being an alcoholic and then something happening where he ha to change and in the next season he is battling with it mentally We could have smaller hero show up such a a Punisher and Spider Man episode of Spider Man A Moon Knight episode of Black Widow And with show depending on how big they want to go they could give all of those smaller character show too maybe with smaller budget or animated or even just 1 season to really develop the character It make the world feel more lived in,Discussion Shows Would Benefit Comic Books More Than Movies,I feel like story

596,thewonderelf,0,This is very long TL DR at the bottom Some background I been reading comic since I wa a kid I in my 30 now but never had a store in my area One finally opened when I wa 13 and I wa so excited to have my own pull list and chat with the store employee about my favorite book Fables and Ed Brubaker Catwoman at the time And then I hit puberty Suddenly the owner started making inappropriate comment to me touching my shoulder or my wrist asking for hug etc He even gave me his phone number at one point But there were no other store in my area so I just made sure I took a parent with me when I picked up my book Once I had my own car I wa able to make excursion a little farther out to other shop I thought the thing with my shop wa just an anomoly While I never had an experience quite a terrible a the one with my first shop it soon became clear that a a teenage girl I wa not welcome in any shop I went to UNLESS I wa willing to flirt with whatever dude wa working My sincerity wa questioned I wa mocked my purchase were made fun of I put up with all of it because I loved comic and I wasn going to let a few asshole ruin my passion for me When I left for college in a medium sized city the first thing I did were locate the library and the comic book store It wa a small shop crammed with long box of back issue upon back issue And to my utter surprise and bafflement the older guy working there greeted me with a genuine smile asked if I wa a new student and gave me a tour of the store He asked about what I liked and we found out we were both really into Elf Quest He wa at least 30 year older than me but treated me with respect and kindness I wa broke and couldn afford to maintain my pull list but over the next few year I went in whenever I had a little extra money to spend Even if I didn buy anything it wa so nice to just chat to Bruce not his real name about what wa new and hear his story about brush in with comic celebrity After I graduated college and got a real job I went in and set up my pull list Since then Bruce and I have become genuine friend We play a tabletop RPG together and still nerd out about Elf Quest and now Giant Days He just an all around great dude who know his stuff Unfortunately the store isn doing well which I known for awhile So the owner made the rash and poor decision to fire his most knowledgeable most well loved employee who I sure wa also the most expensive I could be wrong but to my knowledge he did not attempt to change strategy or enact any other cost saving measure It may sound petty or vindictive on my part to break up with the store over what amount to a shitty financial situation but I can over emphasize how important it wa for me a a young nerd to find a safe welcoming comic space Everyone who work at the shop is nice but no one is a knowledgeable considerate or well loved a Bruce And no one else went out of their way to welcome me and make me feel at home So I made a tough choice and cancelled my pull list I be signing up at another local shop that ha made great stride in hiring woman and POC employee in recent year But I super bummed that it came to this and that my friend lost his job in such a crappy way It feel kind of like an actual breakup TL DR I wa sexually harassed and made to feel unwelcome and or unsafe in every comic shop I visited until I found a great shop staffed by an older guy who wasn a creep and made me feel welcome I been going to that shop for 15 year now but he just got fired because the shop not doing well So I broke up with the shop and it feel like I broke up with a romantic partner,I just broke up with my comic shop of 15 year because the owner fired the first person who made me a woman feel safe and welcome in a comic shop,This is

600,Donna201299,0,Anyone who is a Comic Book fan and ha been reading comic for a long time know that comic book artist and writer weren always treated the best anyone who isn sadly doesn know what went on behind closed door For most of the time comic book character have existed the actual business itself ha been marginal money wise DC comic didn mention Superman creator Jerry Siegel or Joe Shuster for decade and the lawsuit filed by those two to get the right to Superman back wa settled after they both died and in DC favor Bill Finger wa practically erased from History before Family member and friend had to fight a huge legal battle just to have his name credited a co creator of Batman Martin Goodman the publisher of Timely comic didn give a shit about comic He sold Marvel in the mid 60 when they were in their prime simply because he wa tired of it and had no idea what artist like Stan Lee Jack Kirby Steve Ditko and the others were accomplishing The entire staff basically had to ask for their job back with the new owner Ever hear of Batman Superman Spider Man Ironman The Hulk Yes even marginal fan may know this now but most people until very very recently weren even marginal comic book fan I feel this made it easier for these company to take advantage of their creator The one example that get to me however is what Leah Moore said about Alan Moore on twitter Now I know Alan Moore get a lot of shit for being a cranky old man that hate everything and doesn understand how the world work but the is an interesting read The idea that the man who loved superhero story so much he gave up his job and plunged recklessly into writing comic which at that time wa insane of him to do loved them so much he filled every panel and arguably every balloon and caption with that love loved them so much he tried to make them into something that provoked thought and feeling that addressed issue that spoke to people the way superheroes had always spoken to him That seems crazy to me I have his collection of Marvel comic dogeared from reading from love His problem wa that the medium he adored wa ruled by corrupt despot that the people who made that magic were abused that their contribution wa not valued that it wa stolen from them He already hated that before Watchmen He already knew Kirby had been shafted To see him dismissed a Crazy Old Alan Moore again and again and people not know what made him that way To see people dissing him when their job their industry their medium wa partly built on 40 year of his hard work I am not heartbroken just really fucking disappointed Can you imagine if he hadnt been fucked over If instead of being Grumpy Alan Moore Shouting From His Cave he had spent the past 40 year putting out book after book for DC and the rest Creating vast world full of the superheroes he love Enjoying comic Its a damn shame And from the interview itself in a section which could really do with being shared at least a much a the post Scorcese comment I afraid that for a few year now I have felt that since I am apparently not allowed to own the work that I created in the same manner that an author in a more grown up and worthwhile field might expect to do and since my protest at having my work stolen from me are interpreted by a surely young at heart and non unionised audience a evidence of my grouchiness and cantankerousness then the only active position that is left to me is to disown the work in question I no longer own copy of these book and other than the earnest creative work that I put into them at the time my only association with these work are broken friendship perfectly ordinary corporate betrayal and wasted effort Given that I will certainly never be reading any of these work again and that I have no wish

687,Fucoui,0,This essay is what the title say and I don want to turn this into another moral crusade post so I stay up front this isn about justifying piracy I don it can be justified because it isn a just act and I think people who do pirate and seek comfort in that act should really just get over themselves and accept the fact that they participate in a small harm That being said what many comic creator and others are essentially stating in their argument against pirating is the poor people should be functionally barred from participating in culture because they cannot afford it which is essentially punishing people for living in poverty They are not offering advice to better increase access to comic book in legal way so that the poor can actually participate in culture they are not offering way in which the industry could eliminate piracy in a non punitive way and if you want to utilize the wholly broken criminal justice system to punish someone who stole a comic book essentially ruining that person life then you aren a good of a person than you think you are they are simply stating do not do this I poor I been poor and better than you This isn a a moral stance a many seem to think it is I been actually poor not man freelancing is tough can believe all the shit I have to put up with after graduating from art school and making comic really rough out here way but I two day away from homelessness and absolute poverty I starving and I need a way out way and in a my parent can afford to buy me anything to entertain me with so I steal it because being bored and poor is worse than being just poor nihilistic way During the second mentioned time I had virtually zero legal access to art outside of the library which I frequented but it wasn the perfect solution because of various issue I sure most people who dealt with library are familiar with This is in absolute term a societal moral failing not on par of homelessness in seriousness but of a similar far lesser failing We all in one way or another participate in a system that both fetishizes the power of art whilst also at the same time limiting access to it either through monetary mean the comic industry problem and through epistemic mean which also tie back into economic disparity and class but le of a problem for comic because that are designed to be working class art for working class people This is essentially the argument comic professional are making a deeply conservative one that both undermines the general value of art it important and people should a a right have access to it and really only punishes poor people through the regurgitation of conservative talking point This is not a good argument not for stopping piracy nor from increasing the access to comic and art and their own well being it is simply supporting a terrible status quo for the benefit of the corporation they all work at So what can be changed I state here I no longer read comic beyond a few book a year House of X and Power of X being the big one this year because I been completely priced out of the hobby and while I wished I could get down to the library more I can reliably get there because of issue of transportation time and energy poverty eats away at both of the last one and cause the first one I don torrent or download comic which might surprise people here given this essay I just don participate in the culture anymore beyond reading review and looking at preview because I can afford it But when I wa younger I did still them after I couldn afford to keep up with the weekly price or the bus fair it costed to get to the LCS so I stole it This is the crux of the issue of piracy framing it a a personal responsibility issue neither help creator or get rid of piracy All it really doe is create site of justification by pirate So once again what can be changed First we need to recognize that their are essentially two group of pirate those who will won stop pirating and really don give a shit you call them bad or wrong or killing the industry and functionally unreachable and those who literally can because issue of poverty or access or geography and so on I think it a mistake to confuse one for the other because all you doing to is turning the second into the first With that out the way what can be done about the second group A number of thing that are more suited for the betterment of the medium than telling them they are horrible people and are literally killing your child or some shit for downloading a infinitely replicated digital file I going to offer a number of argument that are more favourable for everyone from largest in term of scale to the smallest 1 A literal revolution that fundamentally change the fabric of our society so that worker including the pirate and the comic professional don need to either submit to a work place tyranny or starve to death and provides basic standard of living for everyone so those who want to spend the effort and time on art can without worry about starving and those who don want to pay for it don have to This is will not happen in our life time but it still a better argument than yelling at people on the internet either buy my book you actual filth 2 Utilizing the current government system to better fund art through public grant and other various method that give artist a livelihood that isn directly tied to how well a rigged economic system sell there book I would also propose this only be tied to creator owned book corporation should provide a basic standard of living for all individual they hire or they shouldn exist Again very unlikely 3 A union literally a union so that piracy doesn effect the bottom line of comic professional I know most comic professional unfortunately think like small business owner instead of worker but union have demonstrated to increase living standard across the board in a industry even for those not apart of the union 4 Destroy the direct market make comic cheaper and various other way the industry itself can change to not only make comic more affordable but make it more accessible which in turn would help out creator We see comic outside of the direct market flourish be it manga European comic or YA graphic novel 5 for creator owned comic utilize pay a you want which I used in pas creative endeavor and surprisingly most people paid the price ceiling and those who couldn were incredibly grateful or other pricing scheme or start a patreon or other crowdfunding but not Kickstarter because they are deeply anti union source supplement your income that will help eliminate the second group of pirate 6 lastly do a you are now Just yelling into the void of the internet If the goal is to destroy pirating and I agree it is then there are much better way than what is going on right now No amount of moral grandstanding is going to end the problem and I doubt anything ever will but there are better solution that just

real world and don turn into big damn hero with Batgod plot armor In fact the book is mostly about failure and character almost have to pay for theirs The art in Outbreak is a classical four color

but it still really good MY SCORE 7 10 This stuff will make you a god damned sexual Tyrannosaurus just like meReview Aliens and Predator series by Mark Verheiden TL DR Go read them they are awesome

946,dracosadra723,0,Now I wa originally gonna post this on a subreddit that wa dedicated to Superheroes but the sub wa pretty much dead Also this is not to convert you into liking a certain type of hero but rather to understand their importance So I pretty sure that people here at this subreddit love superheroes Comics are the home of Superheroes We have gotten many superheroes that have affected our culture over the year like Superman Spider Man and Batman You have most likely heard many scholar talk about how superheroes are our modern American mythology and I couldn agree more But lately we have been getting a surge of a certain kind of hero and have seen a decline of another certain type of hero Now there are many sub archetype but I am only going to be talking about the two main type of hero and those two type of hero are the Aspirational and the Motivational hero Let establish what those hero are The aspirational hero are hero who don need a multi layered reason a to why they became a hero they become a hero because it simply the right thing to do They don have moral failing nor do they or should question their aspiration This type of hero is obviously in line with hero such a Superman and Captain America People usually say how the aspirational hero are unrelatable but the thing they aren supposed to be relatable they can be relatable but what is more important is whether they are inspiring The motivational hero are hero that have a multi layered reason to become a hero Like for example Spider Man who became Spider man after watching his uncle Ben die because he failed to take action and do the right thing These character have flaw and mess up from time to time We have been getting more and more motivational hero than we have been getting aspirational hero and the aspirational hero like Superman and Captain America have been deconstructed to be more of a motivational hero The thing is that we need aspirational hero a much a we need motivational hero because aspirational hero are their to set the standard of what is truly good Spider Man need Captain America to aspire to be that good without the aspirational hero the motivational hero are basically lost in what they are striving for because they don have a standard to aspire to Don get me wrong we need motivational hero to show u that it is okay to fail and that even though we fail that we must never give up what we are aspiring to do So that is the importance of aspirational hero they are there to set the moral standard for motivational hero I want to know what you guy

cheery 3 They say he is boring So a a fun little thing I would like to say why these are wrong Not saying you have to like the character by any mean but I have always found these argument to not be good I know a lot of comic character that I don really like that others love because I just have no interest in them Let begin 1 Superman isn that OP He is when you compare him to other hero but any hero can be OP given certain comparison People act like Superman only fight giant robot or car thief But he isn A lot of the people Superman fight either have kryptonite or something along those line that weaken him or they can use magic which also weakens him Plus I always found this argument weird anyway Every hero beat probably 99 of their villain If you random pick up a Green Arrow comic or Spider Man comic do you really think their is a possibility of him dying No Heroes don really have a chance of dying unless they make it a big event It at least on the cover if not also in the name of that issue Plus it not really ever about for pretty much any character of if they win but how they win Same applies to Superman On top of all of that Superman might not be easily killed but that doesn mean he can still lose He may beat the villain but what if the villain wipe out all of Metropolis 2 They plenty of comic where Superman is more serious and dark But what make Superman Superman is his hope He inspires hope Even when he is scared Even when he is worried or upset He inspires everyone around him to keep fighting But Clark Kent a plenty of moment in comic where he feel more human and like a regular person and I personally like him being more happy DC like to have a lot of darker and sadder hero Superman being happy make for a good contrast Same reason I like the Titans Teen Titans Young Justice some Flash stuff Same reason I like Spider Man in Marvel They are just fun character 3 Alright Call the comic lame call him a boy scout say whatever but boring That just make it seem like you aren that invested in the world of DC A lot of the battle Superman get in involves the entire city or the fate of the whole world They are hardly boring Hell even one of my favorite comic series I could understand someone calling boring because it seems like it is 90 dialogue Rebirth Deathstroke but most Superman comic I can really seem to call boring Maybe I am just picking up the really good one I don know but I have yet to read one and be like Could have not bought this,Discussion I never understood people dislike of Superman,So a lot of people I know really hate Superman He isn my favorite comic book character not even in my top 10 but I never disliked him I actually find his part in huge event to be my favorite part Like in DCeased I loved him in DCeased But so many people I know just can stand him They usually can stand him for these reason 1 They say he is too OP 2 They say he is too happy and cheery 3 They say he is boring So a a fun little thing I would like to say why these are wrong Not saying you have to like the character by any mean but I have always found these argument to not be good I know a lot of comic character that I don really like that

1206,ThriceGreatHermes,0,Earlier this year No One Left To Fight subtitled the comic you always wanted By writer Aubrey Sitterson and Artist Fico Ossio wa released My first thought wa this Dragon Ball Z fan fiction and that Aubrey probably wished that Goku and Bullma had hooked up at the end of end of Dragon Ball Hell Aubrey basically said that what the comic is though he did so with more eloquent and likely to provoke a copyright suite language However there is more to it than that Be for we go any further let me say this NOLTF is good Fan Fic The comic doe something that the the Shounen battle manga rarely if ever do ask what happens after the final epic battle is over The standard Heroic Narrative and the le well known Heroinic Narrative http www writersstore com the virgin promise a new archetypal structure are about maturatio growing up The Hero is a figurative and in the case of coming of age story a literal child They are transformed by their experience into a fully functional Adult Okay so where the story about how to Adult the Post Heroes Journey That normally dealt with a a sequel The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions Captain America Winter Soldier Kung Fu Panda 2 So where the story about getting old looking back upon the battle fought choice made having and to deal with the consequence of those choice a well a preparing the next generation Those sort of tale are much rare or least i haven come across them No one Left to Fight is that third story The Heroes killed the big bad have put their adventure behind them and settled down There is quite literally NO ONE LEFT TO FIGHT Timor our Blue haired Vegeta krilin analog actually ha kid and Vale our scarlet headed Goku analog while childless for reason that I shant spoil is given the offer by his former master to help train the next generation of mystical martial artist I accidentally sold the comic to someone in store my saying that NOLTF is the cast of DBZ dealing a mid life crisis Maybe I have a future in sale My flippant but factual statement is a good shorthand for the series In some way NOLTF tag line is completely true for me because it something that I did want to see The high energy and unabashed fantasticality that defines what people tend to think of when they here the word Anime Filtered through the a western lens in particular the grit and maturity I would kill for Joe Abercrombie to be given the licence to write original story in the Blazblue setting Beneath all the bright colorful character that go hi y a they battle across the screen Is a very dark and rich setting While NOLTF isn that dream made manifest it is that idea No One Left To Fight isn merely Dragon Ball Z fan fiction It Dragon Ball would have been if the idea had come to a western comic writer back in the 80 http www youtube com watch v x vpfEY0sl8 The Fifth and final issue of this arc wa released and spoiler gt There are people still left to fight lt I say check out and may be the comic that you always wanted At very least you won be board,No one Left to Fight More than Dragon Ball Z Fan Fiction,Earlier this year No One Left To Fight subtitled the comic you always wanted By writer Aubrey Sitterson and Artist Fico Ossio wa released My first thought wa this Dragon Ball Z fan fiction and that Aubrey probably wished that Goku and Bullma had hooked up at the end of end of Dragon Ball Hell Aubrey basically said that what the comic is though he did so with more eloquent and likely to provoke a copyright suite language However there is more to it than that Be for we go any further let me say this NOLTF is good Fan Fic The comic doe something that the the Shounen battle manga rarely if ever do ask what happens after the final epic battle is over The standard Heroic Narrative and the le well known Heroinic Narrative http www writersstore com the virgin promise a new archetypal structure are about maturatio growing up The Hero is a figurative and in the case of coming of age story a literal child They are transformed by their experience into a fully functional Adult Okay so where the story about how to Adult the Post Heroes Journey That normally dealt with a a sequel The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions Captain America Winter Soldier Kung Fu Panda 2 So where the story about getting old looking back upon the battle fought choice made having and to deal with the consequence of those choice a well a preparing the next generation Those sort of tale are much rare or least i haven come across them No one Left to Fight is that third story The Heroes killed the big bad have put their adventure behind them and settled down There is quite literally NO ONE LEFT TO FIGHT Timor our Blue haired Vegeta krilin analog actually ha kid and Vale our scarlet headed Goku analog while childless for reason that I shant spoil is given the offer by his former master to help train the next generation of mystical martial artist I accidentally sold the comic to someone in store my saying that NOLTF is the cast of DBZ dealing a mid life crisis Maybe I have a future in sale My flippant but factual statement is a good shorthand for the series In some way NOLTF tag line is completely true for me because it something that I did want to see The high energy and unabashed fantasticality that defines what people tend to think of when they here the word Anime Filtered through the a western lens in particular the grit and maturity I would kill for Joe Abercrombie to be given the licence to write original story in the Blazblue setting Beneath all the bright colorful character that go hi y a they battle across the screen Is a very dark and rich setting While NOLTF isn that dream made manifest it is that idea No One Left To Fight isn merely Dragon Ball Z fan fiction It Dragon Ball would have been if the idea had come to a western comic writer back in the 80 http www youtube com watch v x vpfEY0sl8 The Fifth and final issue of this arc wa released and

1215,Donna201299,0,I am a major Hank Pym fan and I have been for a long time It started with a fascination with his awesome power but I began to relate more and more to this tortured genius though lauded a perhaps the most creative genius in the MU he is the forgotten Avenger the much despised hero I have always admired what a tragic and complex character he is between his relationship with Jan his fellow Avengers his progeny Ultron and yet he is always striving to better himself despite any and all setback He ha a passion curiosity and sense of duty that could rival Richards Parker and anyone else Unfortunately Hank Pym ha been one of the most ill treated major character in comic history His only solo ongoing ha been Tales to Astonish He almost had an Ant Man ongoing in 2003 under MAX but it wa cancelled prior to first issue while Scott Lang get to be the first Ant man with an ongoing In recent year it seemed writer have tried to sweep Pym under the rug of Avengers history his status a a founding Avenger seemingly lost upon most people or uncomfortably pushed to side by others I had long since accepted that to get my Pym fix I would have to be patient and grateful for what I got I happy I received the fatherly teacher from Avengers Academy the leader in Avengers AI and occasionally a true Avenger in the crossover and event that have included him When the rumor of an Ant man movie were first beginning to rumble I wa ecstatic to think that Pym would get to be on screen and a the MCU kicked off I held onto the fragile hope that he would get his due and be a founding Avenger on the silver screen Instead we get Hawkeye and Black Widow What more it seemed that Edgar Wright had decided that the second Ant man would be the one to be in the movie while Pym is relegated to being an aging figure with his glory day far behind him To add salt to the wound the great Tony Stark is now the creator of Ultron in the MCU with not even a hint towards his true origin traded for a little more spotlight on Iron Man The OGN Rage of Ultron wa an excellent read a well put together story with an immense focus on Pym demon As a Pym fan I couldn have asked for a better story that is until the way it ended I can help but think this is Marvel way of handling the Pym problem Get him out of the picture and allow Lang to supplant the Ant man legacy all for the sake of the MCU Hell post Secret Wars we may find out that it wa actually Tony who headed the Ultron project while Pym acted a his lab assistant if that The point of this rant is that I just kind of frustrated over the treatment of a character I really enjoy I a fan I have little to no say over what writer choose to do with these character but I can help but feel angry over a character that I grown particularly attached to I fear for the future of Hank Pym Though certainly nothing in comic is forever I feel a though a certain damage ha been done to the potential of this hero I long since given up the battle of explaining to friend who are movie goer or people new to comic who the real ant man is who the real inventor of Ultron is who this forgotten Avenger is Who know maybe RoU is just a sign of good Pym

1352,Naughty_Cookies,0,Hi I am trying to read Spider Man in absolute chronological order instead of publication order I am in the beginning reading Amazing Spider Man annual Untold Tales of Spider Man

1695,Cole-Spudmoney,0,I read Geoff Johns second run on The Flash with Barry from Flash Rebirth through to Flashpoint Then I went back and read the last part of the previous volume starring Wally from issue 231 to 247 Then I went back again and read the series Flash The Fastest Man Alive with Bart a the Flash followed by the All Flash one shot The beginning of Flash The Fastest Man Alive is just dull The story is dull the general setup is dull Bart roommate Griffin is such a jerk from the start that you have to wonder why they even friend and it no surprise at all when he becomes a villain Bart himself is drained of all personality his only distinguishing feature is his encyclopaedic knowledge which isn a personality trait The series start with Jay a the main Flash and he is automatically more interesting than Bart is to the point that I rather be reading a series about him instead The series doe pick up a little once Bart commits to being the Flash but only because it get a sense of direction all those problem are still there The series get a boost of energy in issue 9 when Marc Guggenheim take over a writer but it too little too late a he had to have known when he began that Bart wa gonna die in five issue time Bart is finally written with a distinctive voice but unfortunately it Wally voice his status quo isn anything like what Wally would be doing so the series is distinctive in that way but he still sound like Wally But I did kind of enjoy these issue then come 13 and Bart death is just really unsatisfying He didn need to die in order to stop the explosion so I don buy him being at peace with it when it happens And I don buy the Rogues killing him either and especially not killing him and then immediately panicking about it and trying to pin all the blame on Inertia I heard that Wally return wa supposed to be bad or mediocre but I really don see why Yes Mark Waid arc The Wild Wests isn a good a the best of his earlier long run but it still good I put it on par with his work from around Presidential Race through to Hell to Pay I actually liked the inclusion of Wally kid here more than I liked the inclusion of Superman son in Tomasi Superman I think because Iris and Jai share the same amount of spotlight that Jon get all to himself and there a bit more variety about it with Iris a the bolder one and Jai a the quieter one And I really liked how both their power were different because their developing Speed Force connection were expressing in different way I thought that wa pretty creative Anyway the series stay good after Waid leaf It doesn end with a bang but not with a whimper either more like gliding to a smooth stop Then Flash Rebirth come along and ruin everything Its attempt to convince u that it is so much better than what came before just end up making it so much worse with how desperately Geoff Johns want Barry Allen to seem cool He created the Speed Force so that make him important and therefore cool And he got a tragic backstory now The bowtie weren actually his fault Central City is edgy Can help but notice his wife Iris Allen is suddenly de aged about twenty year too to be the same age a him Meanwhile practically every character cannot stop shilling Barry and talking about how great he is the first thing Jay say is Barry Allen made me the Flash which just made me think What No The only dissenting voice is Bart and the fact that his criticism of the whole situation are so accurate yet get ignored make it feel like Geoff Johns saying Geoff hears ya Geoff don care Then there what this miniseries doe to Wally and his kid Wally suddenly doesn have that balance in life between being a superhero and fatherhood that he had in his own series he ha to stay home and be the dorky beleaguered dad so that Barry can look le dorky by comparison Meanwhile Jai ha suddenly morphed from a quiet nice kid to the most horrendous little brat on the planet while Iris sorry Irey ha become a lot more whiny and wilting then Irey somehow steal away Jai Speed Force connection which turn her from a character with her own distinct power set to just another speedster But hey she get the Impulse name possibly to ensure Bart stay Kid Flash the way Geoff Johns arranged it and I hope she enjoys it a she is written out of the series along with her family and is never seen a a superhero again By the way yes I know Geoff Johns wanted to write a secondary title called Speed Force about Wally and his family and Bart until it got cancelled because of the New 52 But given what we know about what would happened in it Jai becomes a villain a the new Turtle and probably fulfils that premonition about Wally One of your child will destroy your life I honestly think we dodged a bullet It rather have nothing than have Jai West get Superboy Primed The Dastardly Death of the Rogues is easily the best part of the run with Barry because it stop trying to tell u that Barry so great and let u actually just see him in action And okay Barry himself is still kind of bland but his new status quo is interesting in it own right And there that beautiful Francis Manapul art to look at so I don even mind the decompressed storytelling that much Overall I like this story for much the same reason I like Manapul run on the New 52 Flash series judged on it own merit it work I also thought issue 7 with Captain Boomerang wa enjoyable and 8 with Reverse Flash wa interesting Then Road to Flashpoint come along and poor Geoff just can help himself he right back to shilling Barry at u and insisting that he so great and the most important and bestest Flash evar There something kind of symbolic about the last time we see Wally West before the New 52 erased him it in the penultimate issue and he tell Barry Before I knew your secret I hoped the Flash wa Barry Allen which anyone who read Born to Run know is a complete lie then when Bart run away in a temper Wally is about to run after him but Barry stop him and insists No you stay I run and go instead Flashpoint is a weird story because it sits kind of halfway between being a Flash story and being a DC universe wide Crisis tier story The core of the thing is about Barry but that make up surprisingly little of the whole the rest is all subplots and cameo around the wider world of the alternate timeline that ultimately don even add up to much Maybe if they had more time before the reboot then more of the stuff that ended up in the tie in miniseries would ended up in the main event and properly tipped it over into being an actual Crisis Speaking of the tie in I have some thought about the miniseries Flashpoint Kid Flash Lost I thought it wa really well done and you can tell that Sterling Gates like Bart a lot a a character but I have certain problem with Bart apparent death at the end I understand why they did it and rebooted the character entirely for the New 52 because Bart with his history wouldn have fit at all in the new timeline but it still gall me that it happens in a tie in and isn even referenced in the main series Not only that but his death is entirely to give Barry a boost The issue try to frame it a a triumph and sure it better than his first death but all it doe is drive home how everything is now about Barry Barry is all all is Barry Barry Barry Barry,Discussion Thoughts after reading The Flash from the One Year Later relaunch through to Flashpoint,I read Geoff Johns second run on The Flash with Barry from Flash Rebirth through to Flashpoint Then I went back and read the last part of the previous volume starring Wally from issue 231 to 247 Then I went back again and read the series Flash The Fastest Man Alive with Bart a the Flash followed by the All Flash one shot The beginning of Flash The Fastest Man Alive is just dull The story is dull the general setup is dull Bart roommate Griffin is such a jerk from the start that you have to wonder why they even friend and it no surprise at all when he becomes a villain Bart himself is drained of all personality his only distinguishing feature is his encyclopaedic knowledge which isn a personality trait The series start with Jay a the main Flash and he is automatically more interesting than Bart is to the point that I rather be reading a series about him instead The series doe pick up a little once Bart commits to being the Flash but only because it get a sense of direction all those problem are still there The series get a boost of energy in issue 9 when Marc Guggenheim take over a writer but it too little too late a he had to have known when he began that Bart wa gonna die in five issue time Bart is finally written with a distinctive voice but unfortunately it Wally voice his status quo isn anything like what Wally would be doing so the series is distinctive in that way but he still sound like Wally But I did kind of enjoy these issue then come 13 and Bart death is just really unsatisfying He didn need to die in order to stop the explosion so I don buy him being at peace with it when it happens And I don buy the Rogues killing him either and especially not killing him and then immediately panicking about it and trying to pin all the blame on Inertia I heard that Wally return wa supposed to be bad or mediocre but I really don see why Yes Mark Waid arc The Wild Wests isn a good a the best of his earlier long run but it still good I put it on par with his work from around Presidential Race through to Hell to Pay I actually liked the inclusion of Wally kid here more than I liked the inclusion of Superman son in Tomasi Superman I think because Iris and Jai share the same amount of spotlight that Jon get all to himself and there a bit more variety about it with Iris a the bolder one and Jai a

1774,501id5Nak3,0,So for my history seminar class the topic of the day wa anti totalitarianism So our teacher assigned another student and I these two reading packet on Monday The other student had Koestler and I got George Orwell The reading packet came with a part of Orwell Nineteen Eighty Four Specifically the part where O Brien is questioning Winston Smith and go onto explain the philosophy of the Party To those who have not read Nineteen Eighty Four that contrary to Smith original assumption the Party doe not use power a a necessary evil to rule over the weak and inept mass Instead the Party cling to power for power sake A thought occurred in my mind about something Then O Brien talk about how freedom is slavery and slavery is freedom In this part he state that if a man is independent he will always be defeated a death is the ultimate defeat O Brien say in order to not suffer this defeat man must give up any sense of freedom and individuality by joining the Party In Oceania the Party is the body and all of the people in it are it cell When one dy another take it place Next O Brien asks Smith about how doe a man asserts his authority to another Smith answer with By making him suffer which is the correct answer Finally O Brien go onto a spiel about how the Party plan to strip away any positive emotion such a love with negative emotion such a hate They plan on further transforming Oceania into a civilization based on fear rage triumph and self abasement The Party want to basically dehumanize the human race and transform them all into glorified puppet because God is Power As I wa reading this I actually began to wonder whether or not Jack Kirby had read Nineteen Eighty Four in the past and thought about using it a a template for Darkseid and Apokolips because of the uncanny similarity I noticed For starter the Party basically wish to eradicate free will in Oceania just like Darkseid want for the universe Apokolips and Oceania both fear and revere their leader despite how cruel they are towards them The Party want a society where fear and cruelty are the cornerstone just like Apokolips already ha O Brien even say that the Party wish to take away child from their mother after birth which is similar to Granny Goodnesses orphanage If anything Apokolips is if Oceania had already achieved those goal Granted Nineteen Eighty Four is not an obscure novel a it ha influenced many work that criticize totalitarianism That and Kirby wa no stranger when it came to anti fascist comic I began to look for any evidence of Kirby being influenced by Orwell and his novel but found no evidence whatsoever Before anyone criticizes me I well aware that I just probably making an assumption based on some similarity I noticed If anything it most likely because both Kirby and Orwell borrowed element from Nazi Germany when it came to designing their respective totalitarian dystopia It also likely that writer following Kirby also borrowed element from Nineteen Eighty Four Sort of like this panel from Final Crisis 5 amp x200B http preview redd it lthzdwvofrv31 jpg width 1789 amp format pjpg amp auto webp amp

inspiration for this panel Especially with him admitting that the line Judge others Condemn the Different and the slogan To die on the job is to die for Darkseid are not too different from those that the Party would propagate The philosophy of the Party reminded me about why Kirby made the Anti Life Equation take away free will because Kirby believed that the opposite of life wa slavery In Oceania
