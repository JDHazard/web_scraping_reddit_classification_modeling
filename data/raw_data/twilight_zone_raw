Recently, someone told me about an episode of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour called The Jar, which they thought was an episode of the Twilight Zone.

I watched it tonight, it's the first and only episode of the show I've seen.  I somewhat enjoyed it, although it seemed a little ""darker"" than the Twilight Zone, and less ""sci-fi"" focused. I'm not sure if I should try to watch more episodes or not.  Maybe I just chose the wrong episode to start with.

How does the show compare to the Twilight Zone overall?  Are there good episodes that any Twilight Zone fan would enjoy?",GAMESHARQ,"Twilight Zone fans, what's your opinion on the Alfred Hitchcock Hour?",1576033541,14,True,TwilightZone,2019-12-10
1,"********SPOILERS AHEAD********


Just wanted to warn anyone before reading all this, that there are spoilers in here for those who haven't see this episode yet. 


Now, on with the show!!


OK, so let's first talk about the number 14. The number 14 is mentioned a total of 3 times throughout this episode. First, when the driver says ""Mister, that's a 14 year old bus, and business is lousy"". Not only that, but before he says this, he says ""What do you think I got parked out there, a 707?"" What is 7 + 0 + 7? **14**!!

The second time 14 is mentioned, the alien behind the counter says ""Nothin's come in here for 14 hours"". 

The third mention of the number 14 is when the bus riders are checking out at the diner counter. The alien behind the counter says that the first alien had ""14 cups of coffee"". Damn, that's a lot of coffee...


OK, so how many times is the number 14 mentioned? 3 times. How many arms did the first alien have? 3. How many eyes did the other alien have? 3. 

Keep that in mind - 

Now let's talk about the title of this episode - ""Will the real martian please stand up?"". Well, actually, let's hold off on that one, for just a second. 

Let's talk about the officers. How many were there? 2. How many aliens were there? 2. Now, let's multiply 14 by 2 to get 28. Now, let's add 3 to that number (3 for how many arms/eyes the aliens had, and how many times 14 was mentioned), and what do you get? 31. 

Now, how many letters are in the title of this episode? **31!!** 

Phew... man, I'm tired from all that math... 


But wait, there's more! 

How many times was 14 mentioned? 3. How many arms did the first alien have? 3. How many eyes did the second alien have? 3. Add those together, and you get 9. What time did the first alien say his meeting was in Boston? **9AM!!!** 

Okay, okay. I'm reaching with some of these, but I sat there last night re-watching this episode, and I couldn't get all these damn numbers out of my head. 

If you made it this far, I commend you. I doubt any of this means anything, but I found it interesting, nonetheless.

15,"Hooooooooo boy. Season Four is the most infamous one of the series thanks to the controversial decision to have hour-long episodes. Some people think that The Twilight Zone wasn’t meant to have anything but half-hour episodes, but I’m of the mind that hour-long episodes could have worked if done properly. A longer runtime provides more opportunities to expand upon a concept or spend more time on character development. So, did Season Four take advantage of the runtime to create compelling television? For the most part, no. I’m gonna come out and say it there’s only ONE episode of the entire season that needed to be an hour long. That’s not to say there weren’t other episodes that I’d consider good or even great, but when the runtime becomes an issue for nearly every episode there is a serious problem. Full disclosure, I took a break from writing this because I was starting to feel burnt out, and I realized I was just repeating myself because I have very little to say about most of these episodes. I’m coming back to this after a few weeks so this isn’t going to be the most detailed list I’ve done, partially because I’m blanking on some specific parts of these episodes and partially because I just want to get this over with and move on to Season 5. Anyway, on with the show.

18. **The Bard**: A lot of the “bad” Season Four episodes are bad in a way that isn’t even interesting to talk about, and there isn’t a whole lot to say about The Bard besides “it sucks”. Burt Reynolds chewing the scenery is the only thing worth enjoying in this piece of shit episode that feels like Rod Serling was trying to pull a fast one on the network executives and sponsors that meddled with his scripts. I’m all for a bit of meta-commentary, but the episode has to be good for the commentary to land, and The Bard is about as far from good as an episode can get. Plenty of Twilight Zone episodes leave me with unanswered questions, but all I’m left with here is “why does William Shakespeare feel the need to quote himself and cite the specific lines he’s referencing like a 10th grade English student?” I don’t even want to talk about the absolutely meaningless story; if I said “a failed writer conjures William Shakespeare to write scripts for him” and made you come up with a story in your head, whatever you come up with would probably have more direction than The Bard. This episode would have sucked as a half-hour affair, but being an hour long made it nothing short of insufferable. On that note I want to point out that Rod Serling may be the king of half-hour television, but he seemed to struggle with the hour-long format of Season Four, and it shows in The Bard.

17. **I Dream of Genie**: Some episodes get criticized for not feeling like a Twilight Zone episode, and I’ve never understood that complaint. The Twilight Zone has episodes ranging from Eye of the Beholder to Once Upon a Time to A Passage For Trumpet, nothing’s off the table really. But with I Dream of Genie, I totally get it. The “Twilight Zone” element is minimal at best, 90% of it is just a dude daydreaming about what his wish would be. I didn’t actively dislike it, Howard Morris is entertaining enough to make the time pass, but there’s nothing in this episode that feels like something out of The Twilight Zone. There’s no social commentary, no relationship with the paranormal or supernatural, no spectacular writing, hell it doesn’t even have the hacky shoddiness that the bad episodes are known for. As for the episode we did get, it’s just a series of vignettes with nothing worth talking about.

16. **Passage on the Lady Anne**: While Passage on the Lady Anne is far from the most well-liked Season 4 episode, I seem to be in the minority of people who outright despise it. Some people like it for its character development; it’s an episode more focused on its characters than its concept. On some level I can appreciate that, and I would definitely call Alan and Elaine well developed characters, but a huge part of why The Twilight Zone works for me is the concepts it explores and how the concept helps fuel the character development, story, message, pathos, etc. The concept of Passage on the Lady Anne is so poorly developed that I don’t even know how to describe it. The idea of the ship having supernatural elements is barely explored until the ending, when we’re just told that “the Lady Anne died on her way back to her home planet”. As for the plot, it’s just a bunch of scenes that are hardly connected in any meaningful way. For example, the McKenzies say that Alan and Elaine “don’t have to die” before an ad break, and when we return it’s never brought up again. We’re treated to a whole bunch of half-assed treatises on love and how “the old ways” are being done away with, but it’s all so unfocused that I couldn’t get a read on any sort of story they were telling besides Alan and Elaine’s marriage being in shambles. I’ll say it right now, Charles Beaumont wrote 6 episodes this season, and this is far and away his only bad one.

15. **Of Late I Think of Cliffordville**: Twilight Zone actors who star in more than one episode are almost always fantastic actors: Jack Klugman, Burgess Meredith, John Anderson, etc. Albert Salmi is an exception. Of all the actors who have appeared in three or more episodes, he’s one of the only ones I can think of that was never all that good in any of them. He’s never outright terrible, but he never elevates any episode that he’s in. Case in point, Of Late I Think of Cliffordville. It’s funny, a commercial came on before this episode telling me to “think about my eyes”, and maybe I should have taken that to heart because the old-age makeup Salmi had to wear was painful to look at. I know the show was fighting against budget restraints, but they were able to pull it off in Long Live Walter Jameson so there’s no excuse. Pretty much every episode with a “deal with the devil” story has an idiot for a main character, but Feathersmith is a special kind of idiot. Part of that has to do with the character not being written all that well, but part of that also has to do with Albert Salmi not having the charisma to make this character work onscreen (Salmi famously hated film/TV acting, that may have something to do with it). Julie Newmar and John Anderson are great, but their talents are wasted because they play second banana to Salmi, who never should have been in this role in the first place. With a different lead actor I may have liked it more, but I doubt it.

14. **No Time Like the Past**: What could have been a decent half-hour episode was turned into a pointless hour of television. Paul Driscoll can’t change the past. This is a lesson that was learned in the first twenty minutes when he couldn’t evacuate Hiroshima, (like five fucking minutes before the bomb drops) kill Hitler, or change the course of the Lusitania (again, five minutes before it gets torpedoed), yet somehow this episode managed to last fifty goddamn minutes. He’s not unable to change the past because “the past is written in stone”, he’s unable to change the past because he’s a fucking moron. Those first twenty minutes were absolutely irrelevant, this episode could have started with Paul going to 1881 to stop Garfield’s assassination and moved on from there and nothing would have been different. That probably wouldn’t have saved No Time Like the Past, the acting was pretty lackluster throughout (especially from Abby) and the writing isn’t all that inspired outside of some FANTASTIC dialogue during the dinner scene. The dinner scene is the only scene I actually enjoyed, it was the only moment in the entire episode where Serling showed us why he’s one of the best writers in the history of television. It’s a scene so good that it’s genuinely baffling how much the rest of the episode sucks.

13. **The Incredible World of Horace Ford**: The Incredible World of Horace Ford shouldn’t have been an hour-long episode. I enjoyed about 10-15 minutes worth of material, which would have been thin even for a half-hour episode, but with a runtime of over an hour it’s damn near interminable. This episode was full of filler, so many themes and scenes were repeated nearly verbatim and it just got old. I also really didn’t like his mother, it would have been cool if she was similar to the mother in Young Man’s Fancy but she’s given no character so she adds nothing to the story. That’s not to say nothing worked in this episode. I love the idea of Horace Ford as a character, but he’s the type of character who works best in small doses so following him for an hour got pretty grating. I also thought the story they told was pretty good, it has shades of Walking Distance and the aforementioned Young Man’s Fancy, but the execution really suffers due to the runtime. With one exception, no other Season 4 episode suffers more from its runtime; the parts I did enjoy were dragged on too long and the rest of the episode is pure filler.

12. **Mute**: The premise of a little girl losing the only people that she could communicate with is one worth exploring, and if Mute stuck to that it would have been fantastic. The parts of the episode that do line up with that premise are the best parts, like the times when she reads people minds and especially the moment when she reflects on how she learned about boats without words. More of that would have been nice, but the story ends up being a bit of a mess. Not a complete mess, but there was too much drama for its own good. Cora burning the letters was dumb and selfish, and I don’t like how that decision doesn’t bite her in the ass at all in the end (I totally get her motivation, but this aspect of the episode was really unnecessary). “Mommy issues” was a really weird recurring theme this season, and I don’t understand why because it was never good. This is an episode that really didn’t need to be an hour long, even immediately after watching it I didn’t have a whole lot to say about it.

11. **Jess-Belle**: I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I really liked Jess-Belle. Yes, I enjoyed one of the episodes that’s almost universally considered bottom ten material. Were there problems though? Absolutely. Earl Hamner wrote this script in about a week with absolutely no revisions, and boy does it show. This episode could have ended with Jaguar Jess being killed by Billy-Ben, but we had to add one of the most tacked-on endings the show ever produced. This was a story that should have been no more than 25 minutes, there wasn’t a whole lot of filler so to speak but the story really didn’t need to be extended to an hour. There’s also a bit of a tone problem, despite how absolutely ridiculous the story can get it’s all weirdly melodramatic. Speaking of how ridiculous this episode gets, I don’t think I’ve ever laughed harder in my life than I did when Jess-Belle turned into a damn leopard. Despite all that working against the episode, I did enjoy it. The plot could have been executed a lot better, but I liked the story they were trying to tell. Part of that had to do with the rather engaging performances, especially from Billy-Ben. The set design was gorgeous, I don’t know why but when this show tries to go for a “southern charm” I seem to like it more than most fans. It’s easy to see this episode for all the flaws that it (objectively) has, but it’s just as easy to forget that this isn’t one of those episodes where absolutely nothing works.

10. **The Thirty-Fathom Grave**: When Rod Serling clearly had trouble filling the new runtime (take a shot every time I say this and you’d be dead), which is a damn shame because a lot of the episodes he wrote could have been classics in a different season. The Thirty-Fathom Grave feels like two half-hour episodes that were loosely connected at best. In one story we have Chief Bell having a bout of PTSD, and in the other we have the mystery of the sunken submarine. Either would have made for an excellent episode on their own, but combining them together didn’t bring out anything special. Simon Oakland’s performance as Captain Beecher was the highlight, he added some much needed weight to this overly long, slow affair.

9. **Miniature**: Every season of The Twilight Zone has one fan favorite that I just can’t get behind. Season One has Mirror Image, Season Two has The Silence, Season Three has Five Characters in Search of an Exit, and representing Season Four is Miniature. That’s not to say Miniature is bad, but there’s nothing here that I haven’t seen in other episodes. There are reasons why it’s a fan favorite though, and I imagine a lot of that has to do with Robert Duvall’s performance as Charlie. Charlie is a well-meaning yet socially awkward oddball, and Duvall’s performance is heartfelt without losing the weirdness that makes Charlie stand out. I don’t really think the “miniature” gimmick was all that creative, but the cinematography  makes the dollhouse scenes my favorites in the episode. Where this episode begins to lose me is it’s story. So many episodes have plots that could be boiled down to “a man doesn’t fit in with the world around him so he loses himself in one of his own creation”, but those stories are only ever interesting to me when they break from that formula like in A Stop at Willoughby. Miniature comes very close to doing something special with the formula by having some scenes in the dollhouse reflect events in Charlie’s life, but I never felt like they committed to that premise. For example, it felt like the girl in the dollhouse getting abused could have been a metaphor for his sister’s relationship with her boyfriend, but moments like those are rare and don’t ultimately play into the ending. This wasn’t a bad episode at all, I just don’t see it as the best episode of Season 4.

8. **Printer’s Devil**: There’s only so many ways to tell a “deal with the devil” story, for the most part once you’ve seen one you’ve seen em all. That’s really not the case with Printer’s Devil, which feels like a fresh take on an old format. The audience is told right away that Smith is the devil, but Winston doesn’t know what’s up until it’s almost too late. On one hand it’s frustrating seeing Winston so slow to pick up on his situation, on the other hand it creates an interesting dynamic between Smith and Winston, with Smith using Winston’s ignorance to his advantage. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a “Faustian bargain” ending with the devil being beaten at his own game but that’s exactly what happens here. Speaking of Smith, this was Burgess Meredith’s last Twilight Zone episode and he couldn’t have gone out on a higher note. I don’t think the episode had problems filling out the hour, but it still feels like two half-hour scripts combined into one; take an episode about a printer that predicts the future and an episode about a deal with the devil, and you have Printer’s Devil. That’s not really a complaint, but it felt worth mentioning. Also, I loved the visual presentation of this episode, especially that shot of Smith’s reflection in the window.

7. **The Parallel**: I was a huge fan of The Parallel when I first watched it, but I’m not as high on it now as I was. The concept is simple but brillaint, and they do an amazing job of showing off the subtle differences between the parallel universes. I love how subtle the differences were for the most part, it drives home the fact that this universe is close enough to the one Robert calls home, but this isn’t where he belongs; this wouldn’t have been as impactful if the parallel universe had aliens roaming around or something crazy like that. The acting is superb, especially from Robert and his family, and I love how the truth behind Robert’s situation is lightly hinted at until the “President Kennedy” revelation at the end of the first half. Once it’s clear that Robert is in a parallel universe, the episode expands on this and takes the story... absolutely nowhere. This episode had the makings of a masterpiece, with shades of Little Girl Lost, And When the Sky Was Opened, Shadow Play, and other tense yet low-key episodes. Instead, the second half just repeats information that we already learned in the first half, then Robert sort of just ends up back in his original dimension. I mentioned that Horace Ford suffers the most from its runtime with one exception, and The Parallel is that exception; the story started losing steam after thirty minutes, and it clearly did not have the legs to go another twenty. It’s a shame, because in a just world with a shorter runtime this could have been an all-time classic.

6. **In His Image**: In His Image was the first episode of Season 4, and this was our introduction to the new runtime. I’ve talked a lot about the limitations of the longer runtime, but In His Image does a fine job showcasing the strengths of the new format. Walter and Alan are the central characters in a story that echoes Frankenstein, and the themes that Beaumont explores are given plenty of time to breath throughout the hour without outstaying their welcome. I immediately had flashbacks to The Chaser once I saw George Grizzard, but he does a stellar job of portraying the creator and his creation. Some people have described the episode as an example of “queer coding” from the days when homosexuality in media was taboo; I’m not sure how much I subscribe to that theory, but it’s definitely an interesting take on the concept of creating a “flawless” version of yourself. Overall, more episodes in Season 4 should have used In His Image as an example for how to make an hour-long Twilight Zone episode.

5. **Valley of the Shadow**: Peaceful Valley has been blessed with universe-altering technology, but they don’t trust humanity to use it wisely. There are so many ethical questions brought up in this episode that it leaves you questioning whether anyone involved is fully right or fully wrong. Many Charlie Beaumont episodes end with an “it was just a dream” kind of ending. Sometimes it works like in Shadow Play, sometimes it feels cheap like in Person or Persons Unknown, but in Valley of the Shadow having Redfield “wake up” back at the gas station was the perfect way to end this story. Redfield does the right thing by escaping to share their technology with the world, but in doing so he proved exactly why humanity wasn’t ready for this kind of responsibility. It’s a cynical ending, but also an appropriate one.

4. **The New Exhibit**: Martin Balsam plays a museum worker who’s obsessed with his wax figures, not unlike Charlie in Miniature. While the dolls in Miniature are a reflection of Charlie’s fragile mind, the figures in The New Exhibit have a more active role in the story. It’s up to the viewer to decide whether the figures were haunted or if Martin was just going completely mad, but we can all agree that wax figures can be absolutely terrifying. This is the only proper “horror” episode in Season 4, and part of what makes the horror work so well is the tension; this is the closest The Twilight Zone has come to equaling Hitchcock’s mastery of suspense. Charles Beaumont wrote six episodes this season, just one fewer than Serling did, and I’m confident in calling The New Exhibit the best of the six.

3. **Death Ship**: Death Ship is a multi-layered episode that shows you the final puzzle right up front and spends the rest of the episode assembling the pieces. At this point I’m contractually obligated to call Jack Klugman the best Twilight Zone actor, and naturally he gave us another 10/10 performance, but it’s easy to forget that he’s not the ONLY good actor in his episodes. A Passage for Trumpet had John Anderson, A Game of Pool had Jonathan Winters, and this episode has Ross Martin giving us a performance that I’d argue is even better than Klugman’s (if you’ve read any of my lists before you’d know why this is just about the highest praise I could give an actor). Not only was runtime not an issue here, the entire hour was filled with creative ways to tell the story and it made the time fly by. Captain Ross interfering in Mason’s dream was inspired, and I love how the ending was just an abrupt cut back to the beginning. This episode is rich with character development (this is yet another Klugman episode where loneliness is an aspect of his character) and little moments that I’m sure I’ll pick up on upon rewatching. Of all the Twilight Zone episodes that I absolutely adore, this and Shadow Play are the only two that I’ve wanted to watch again immediately after finishing.

2. **He’s Alive**: At the risk of sounding political, Nazis are bad. In all seriousness, everyone knows that Nazis are bad, and everyone knows that racism, prejudice, and hate are bad. “Are Nazis bad” is an easy question to answer, but “how does hate spread like it did in Nazi Germany” is far more complex, and that’s the question He’s Alive tries time answer. Peter is a chicken-shit wannabe fuehrer whose hate was born out of a need to blame a scapegoat for his shitty life, and with this character Rod pretty much nailed every Proud Boy, every incel, every modern day neo-Nazi, all of them. It can feel on-the-nose at times, but this isn’t an episode that needed to be subtle. It doesn’t shy away from comparing modern day hatred to Hitler’s rhetoric, and moments such as the “we are the minorities” speech very well could have been about 2019 and not 1963. Of course, the message of this episode would have fallen flat without the outstanding performance by Dennis Hopper, who manages to nail every aspect of Peter’s character. Also, Rod’s closing monologue is among his best, and it was the perfect way to cap off an episode that we still need in 2019.

1. **On Thursday We Leave for Home**: In Season 3 it was a tossup between five or six for what the best episode could have been. That’s not the case with Season 4, because On Thursday We Leave for Home completely dwarfs its competition. Death Ship and He’s Alive are both great episodes and either one of them could have been in the number two slot, but neither of them hold a candle to On Thursday We Leave for Home. I don’t think any episode took us on a journey through one character’s arc quite like this one. I didn’t think I’d ever love a performance more than Jack Klugman in A Passage For Trumpet, but James Whitmore’s performance as Captain Benteen was beyond perfect. Captain Benteen might be the most complex character in the series thus far, gradually changing from gentile shepherd of his flock to psychotic megalomaniac. I was sold on Benteen being a good person for half the episode, and I spent the rest of the episode in a state of pure tension because I was afraid of what he might do, and dammit I was nearly in tears by the ending (which I won’t spoil here because this is definitely an episode you need to experience for yourself). This character has so many layers and Whitmore played him to perfection in every scene. The fact that I was sold hook-line-and-sinker on this character is also a testament to Serling’s writing, and this really is one of his best scripts ever. Serling’s unique brand of humanism us present in every single line, especially in his monologues where he waxes poetic about Earth being a complicated yet wonderful mess. Speaking of Serling, he really seemed to struggle with the hour-long format, but leave it to him to write the best hour-long episode because he’s Rod Goddamn Serling. I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I call Season 4 the worst season of the show, but On Thursday We Leave for Home isn’t number one just because it’s the best of a bad lot. Do yourself a favor and watch this episode, maybe watch the rest of the top six, then throw the rest of Season 4 in the garbage.",OneTrueBrody,Every Episode of The Twilight Zone Ranked!

Just the excitement when I first hear the Intro, The mystery throughout the episodes, and the ending is just its own beautiful creation. I think that the ending documentary could make anyone who knows at least the slightest bit of Rod Serling feel emotional and the bigger fans feel it deep in their heart. I truly wish that I could somehow forget the episodes because I can't imagine what it must have been like watching it for the first time in the big theater.

&amp;#x200B;

Y'know, when I browse through the catalog of golden TZ episodes to rehash *A Most Unusual Camera* instantly comes to mind.  It's got nasty people arguing, a spooky device, and a super ironic twist where everyone dies.  It's even got one of those quintessential window deaths!  The four hallmarks of a classic.  But this one isn't content to be your lighthearted four-death romp - it vies for a more dramatic angle, in a *Honeymooners* kinda way.  It packs in more depth than your average 25 minutes but will those Serling plush sales reach projected earnings?  You'll just have to read and find ou- oh, who am I kidding.  Print is dead.  Television is dead.  Long live bingeflix.  *Twilight Zone* has been brought to you by Willie's Windows - too fragile?  Over my dead body!

&amp;#x200B;

After the first couple of minutes this episode comes off as your paint-by-numbers comedy - you've got some light banter from a couple of grumps and the eccentric TV repairman that seems to delight in Joe's trash-talking a little too much.  For what little screentime Holloway gets he's easily the funniest part of the episode.  Normally you expect the devil character to be a charismatic fast-talker like Genie from *The Man in the Bottle* but the way he delivers it with this breathy southern drawl with the lightest hint of knowing - it's perfect.  That look he gives into the camera as he closes the door and that zinger at the end are highlights that make you wish Phyllis had called him back for some more screentime.  Didn't expect Winnie the Pooh to be hauntin' machines and murderin' couples but I guess we're going with the comic canon.  And y'know, there really is some nice early dialogue.  When Phyllis is ranting off her suspicions and tells Joe *""don't jump out a window,""* the irony meter is broken.  Plus she makes a comment about Cleopatra which is real amusing considering *Queen of the Nile* was aired right before this one.

Things start going south when the TV turns on.  Joe reacts very seriously to tonight's episode of *the Twilight Zone*, to the point of fainting - Phyllis is out there riffing about ugly carpets but Joe's shook.  The episode wants you to start empathizing with Joe when he's been built up as a grouchy slob who casually insults TV repairmen.  I mean, if Pooh weren't a devil he'd be well within his rights to leave Joe with his battered-down boob tube.  And even after he regains consciousness he immediately accuses Phyllis of plotting a long con with Pooh in cahoots as if she has cameras planted everywhere or something.  It's hard for me to feel bad for this guy who's been nothing but cartoonishly antagonistic.  Am I saying that Joe should be reacting to this in a cartoonish way?  Well... maybe?  Wouldn't it be funny to jump over the usual hurdles of the character being wide-eyed and sweaty and have him immediately go on a tirade on Phyllis or angrily try to call up the repairman?  Why'd he even tell Phyllis to do it?  Eh, maybe I'm just groaning for the sake of it.  Even if this character's meant to be a comedic caricature it's not terrible for him to act semi-realistically, it even adds depth.  I just hope there isn't some big emotional climax centered around Joe and Phyllis' characters like they haven't been exaggerated curmudgeons this whole time.  That would be real bad.

This episode's shown its hand - the TV guide says Joe's gonna kill Phyllis.  Will the journey be interesting?  What's Joe gonna do to prevent this?  He gives a monologue about how being a cabby is tough and how people are constantly yelling at him and treating him badly.  No.  Bad.  17 minutes in is not the time to start making your protagonist sympathetic, especially with how obnoxious he's been thus far.  As much crap as I've given this episode, it really breaks my heart because it could've been good.  This wouldn't be a bad moment if you toned down the grouchiness and started giving him hints of depth earlier on.  And as much as I hate to say this, if you wanted this to be a dramatic episode then you should've cut the TV repairman out.  Later it's revealed that Phyllis only sees static on Channel 10 which puts forth the idea that Joe may be having a mental breakdown fueled by guilt.  But uh, no he's not.  It's because the spooky TV repairman put a hex on the TV which only he can see somehow.  The presence of Pooh actually strips away nuance and cheapens the drama.  And the worst part is I get what they wanted to do here.  Joe is a sad old man with a grueling job so he drowns his sorrows in booze and TV.  He's seen enough sitcoms to believe that a heartfelt speech will win the girl's heart and fix everything.  But surprise surprise, Phyllis doesn't like being cheated on.  And then the episode makes another blunder by having Phyllis act unrealistically cruel during this big dramatic moment.  Should Phyllis be mad that Joe's been cheatin'?  Yes.  Is she in the right to break up with him?  Absolutely.  By the end of it she vindictively turns the TV on to torment a mentally unstable person.  Before she was surprisingly nice to him when she thought he was sick but now that he's exposed as a cheater she's just gonna straight-up torture him?  He punches a hole through the TV and she just stands there cackling.  What a complete 180.  Is this supposed to be a realistic person?  How am I supposed to take this seriously?  And even after all that there would still be something viscerally poignant about someone tormenting a mentally ill person, blind to their pain - that is of course, if Pooh didn't come back to remind us that it was just a magic trick all along.  What a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

You know what's really neat about this episode?  It sprinkles in some commentary that watching violent television can lead to aggressive behavior which is pretty darn prescient for the 60's.  Through the episode, the only real show Joe watches is wrestling.  You'll notice that during that violent struggle in the end Joe does a chair shot at Phyllis, implying that this was a result of watching so much wrestling.  Phyllis even calls him a ""TV addict.""  It would be real great if we could attribute his violent actions to anything other than Pooh's magic powers.  Once you write in a devil that curses TVs and grins into the camera things become inherently goofier.  That silly old bear, destroying my character depth!  And why did Pooh murder Joe and his wife?  Because he insulted TV repairmen?  That was the straw the broke the camel's back?  Jeez.  And even in a dedicated comedic episode like *A Most Unusual Camera* the bad events are always a product of the character's greed, with a clear progression.  And even if the way they tumble out of the window is contrived the squabble preceding it is in-line with all of their characters.  It also helps that Woodward didn't give an impassioned speech about how he was an orphan raised by the streets.

While I doubt this episode is generally beloved, I doubt many folks would rant about it this much.  Nothing gets my goat like wasted potential.  I'd imagine to your average viewer it's a forgettable so-so episode and that's all well and good.  And in my holy crusade against television I forgot to mention that this episode isn't written by a regular, but one Martin Goldsmith who also wrote *The Encounter*, another Season 5 funfest starring George Takei.  Meh, maybe by the time I get around to that I'll have seen *Detour* and have something more substantive to say about his work in general.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment with the nearest window.",nulldrone,The Groan Zone - What's in the Box,1569126564,1,True,TwilightZone,2019-09-22
1," \&gt;!So I had a theory that the entire episode was due to the fact that the mom prevented the ketchup stain on her son's shirt the first time she used the camcorder. 

In almost every case, we see an escalation by the cop, but she rewinds before it gets too intense. In the one case where she wasn't fast enough to hit rewind, her son was shot... and the wound was in the exact spot where the ketchup stain was.

Every time she goes back, she inadvertently prevents her son from getting ketchup on his shirt.

3,"I'm working my way through a series rewatch right now.  Usually I just cherry pick an episode once every week or two but I'm jumping in marathon style this time.  The first episode (watched it last night) ""Where is Everybody?"" brought a few things to mind.  I don't know if they're actual influences but the overall point of this story, the impact of deprivation, reminded me of Stephen King's short story ""The Jaunt"" in the collection Skeleton Crew.  That's one of my favorite stories so I'm sure there's a bias to my thinking.  But I also noticed when the main character is in the drug store, looking at the book rack, all of the books are titled ""The Last Man on Earth"".  The series with the same title starring Will Forte had to have been inspired by this episode lol!

Also, the set Courthouse Square.  I laughed to myself and thought ""ha, probably the same set from Back to the Future"" , and it was!  Pretty cool how many things were filmed there.  Everything from Leave it to Beaver to an Offspring video.

7,"The Seventh is Made Up of Phantoms, On Thursday We Leave for Home, and Black Leather Jackets are mine. 

I like the first one for the historical aspect of learning a little about the battle of Little Bighorn and Custer’s last stand. Along with the suspense of not knowing where the mysterious sounds are coming from on the mountain ridge. This episode had a unique mysterious vibe to it, and the ending of all three men going back in time to the actual battle and giving their lives for the cause was a nice twist.

I like On Thursday We Leave for Home because it’s an interesting display into the struggles of maintaining and giving up power. Benteen has been the guardian and in his mind a Shepard for all of the people under his watch. He doesn’t want to relinquish all of that power and be just a regular guy. The ending is sad with him being all alone forever on the asteroid, but he is more of a tragic character, while Craig from “The Little People” always wanted to be a tyrant and deserved his fate more.

Black Leather Jackets plays out like those old campy, sci fi, B” movies. I like the combination of aliens and the small out of the way town atmosphere. It’s so weird and cheesy that it’s fun to watch. The twist is also something that caught me by surprise.

8,"I just wanted to talk about this and how I am so surprised that somebody can make an episode of something that is SO specific and get it made. I absolutely love this episode. It made my wife uncontrollably cry for about an half an hour after it ended. Some backstory is needed. 

My wife is an on camera personality, she’s not huge but she has fans from things like Screenjunkies/Collider/her own work. When she started this journey she made the decision to sort of wipe me from her social media (at least the public persona ones). And I never really understood but I felt it alone for the most part. 

She keeps her family life completely separate and a few times had a panic attack when fans would show up at her parents’ house. She would say it felt like “someone is trying to carve out a piece of her life and take it.” And I’ve never seen her fears depicted on screen so vividly. 

To be successful you have to her personable and you have to find that balance in between sharing your life and keeping some for yourself. And I love that this is a horror story about that idea.

If it's one of the other characters, then it seems more like there's a quandary over whether to believe Adam Grant. As a character says to him, he's not really in any danger, but in a sense all the dream characters might be if he gets out of his dream loop and starts dreaming completely different individuals instead of swapping the actors around. Or there'd be the issue of admitting to themselves that Adam Grant is right and they're not real. Imagine if the reporter was afraid to look to see if his steaks actually had turned into a roast in the oven out of fear it would prove Grant does know more about the impossible dream logic of their world then they let on.

1) ""Blue Streak""  
An honest cop who has been in the force for 20 years patrolling the black neighbourhood is suddenly faced with terror as a recently-released ACAB-themed rap music sends the local black populous into a murderous gangsta frenzy!

9,"I looked through previous discussions, and I couldn't find anyone asking the question I'd like to ask. First, a brief recap:

A crook (Rocky) is shot and finds himself in a place where he gets anything he wants and wins at every game of chance. He assumes this is heaven and that the man assisting him (Pip) is an angel. Eventually he becomes bored and says he doesn't belong in heaven--that he'd rather go to ""the other place."" Pip then informs him that this IS the other place.

So this episode is offering a view of one type of hell (although previous Reddit posters had suggested that Rocky simply lacked imagination).  The episode is telling us what heaven is NOT. However, it never tells us what heaven IS.  Many people probably think of heaven as getting to do whatever you want.  If this would eventually become boring, what would be better?  The only answer I can think of is the idea that you could interact with people you had known on earth (which Rocky could not--presumably because they actually did go to heaven).

10,"Just watched Weird City, a Youtube Original by Jordan Peele that is basically comedy Black Mirror, and I was amazed at how similar the season finales of the new Twilight Zone and this show are.

In the Weird City season finale, two actresses become aware that they are on a television show, and end up not being able to escape, and the show even has the classic TZ voice-over narration at the end with some cheesy line about everyone being an actor on a show. It just seems weird to me that the two shows Jordan was doing had almost the same theme for the season finale, especially when meta narrative usually isn't too popular.

6,"After watching Season Two and only really loving a handful of episodes I was worried that the show peaked too soon. I’m glad I was wrong, because Season Three of The Twilight Zone is one of the best seasons of television in the history of the medium. That’s not because every episode was great, though there are very few episodes that I’d actually call “bad”. It’s also not the best season because it had a lot of episodes that I’d call “10/10 perfect”, though that is also true. This season is perfect because nearly every episode left me saying “wow, something about what I just watched makes me love this show even more”. Whether an episode was excellent or mediocre, straightforward or weird, complex or simple, I was always entertained. At a certain point, isn’t that all you need? This was a really hard list to make because so many episodes from this season are somebody’s favorite. I didn’t just rank these based on my subjective feelings, I don’t want to be that guy who says one episode is the best just because it’s my favorite, but everyone’s taste is different. You may think that my least favorite episode should have been number one, and you may think that my favorite episode doesn’t even belong in the top thirty. If you think I was unfair to one episode and ranked another one way too high, let me know because the whole point of this list is to get other people’s opinions? Ok enough of that, on with the show.

37. **Four O’Clock**: The worst episode of this season is also the only episode that I consider absolutely pointless. A man wants to punish the world’s evil-doers by making them two feet tall, but it turns out that he’s the one who gets shrunk at the end. That’s it, that’s the whole episode. Do you want to watch that for 25 minutes? I was able to predict the ending just by reading the episode preview on IMDB. That’s not a bad thing in and of itself, the number one episode on this list has a fairly predictable twist but makes up for it by making the rest of the episode a complete masterpiece, but nothing about Four O’Clock is worth watching. “I want to punish the world.” “No don’t you’re crazy.” Rinse, repeat.

36. **A Quality of Mercy**: I understand that this show is a product of its time, so I can look past the occasional non-PC moment as long as it doesn’t interfere with the rest of the episode (Will Shatner saying he’s being treated like “a retarded child” in Nick of Time is my go-to example for dated lines that can be easily ignored). I can’t get over the yellowface in A Quality of Mercy, though. I get that yellowface was an industry standard at the time, but having the lead character learn about respecting the enemy doesn’t work when the actor is in goddamn yellowface. Imagine having an episode about racism where the main character is played by a white dude in blackface, it actively conflicts with the message. The ending is also one of the weakest endings in the series. “Predictable but inevitable” is a phrase that describes an ending that was easy to see coming but was also the perfect way to end the story. The inevitable ending was for Katell to make the decision not to attack the enemy, but what we got instead was the war ending before Katell could make the call. What should have been the natural conclusion to his character arc just leaves me feeling hollow.

35. **The Gift**: The Gift might as well be retitled “Womp Womp”, because that’s the only thing that comes to mind whenever I think about the ending. Fear of the unknown is a subject that this show usually excels at, but the Christ-like imagery used for the mysterious stranger was way too obvious to be compelling. The Gift was also weirdly melodramatic, especially with the orphaned child. For some reason I compared this episode to Dust because of the melodramatic atmosphere, but Dust also has emotional weight to its scenes that just about justifies the melodrama. That’s not the case with The Gift. Instead, we get an ending where the stranger was about to cure every disease known to man but was killed. Cue the Price is Right horns, next episode.

34. **The Mirror**: “Magic object” episodes are rarely good, but a story about a dictator being consumed by paranoia could have been excellent. The writing was nothing special, and the set design didn’t immerse me in the world of the episode. What really brings The Mirror down is the performances, which were incredibly dull. There’s five characters and I couldn’t tell you a single thing about any of them, these actors didn’t make the characters pop off the screen at all. Overall, The Mirror is just dull. It feels like everyone involved just phoned it in, and that’s almost never the case with this show.

33. **Dead Man’s Shoes**: If I was giving episodes letter grades, the last four would receive Fs. Dead Man’s Shoes would receive a D-, a passing grade but desperately needing improvement. As much as I love the noir aesthetic, it worked a lot better in episodes like The Four of Us Are Dying. The Four of Us Are Dying is actually a great point of comparison, because that episode also dealt with identity. While that episode explored the concept through a variety of lenses, this episode has way too much filler. It takes nearly 20 minutes for the hobo to talk to the mob boss, and that easily could have been edited down to ten minutes (cut the scene with the hobo’s friends and shorten the apartment scene). I still think this episode isn’t a total failure, and that’s because of the ending. The final scene is super intriguing and contextualizes everything that Nathan went through. Unfortunately, he dies before anything interesting can be done with that revelation, and the ambiguous final shot of the other hobo putting on the shoes feels like a tease. This episode would have been interesting if we saw a series of hobos putting on the shoes so the titular “dead man” could seek his revenge. I don’t know if that’s a good idea for an episode, but anything would be more intriguing than the episode we got.

32. **The Jungle**: Does The Jungle suck? Yes. Is it the worst episode of the show like so many people say it is? No. The episode goes way overboard with talking about superstitions, like I get it this guy thinks they’re dumb can we move on? Speaking of the main character, I’m hesitant to even call him a character. I forgot his name halfway through, which makes sense because he’s less of a person and more of a device to move us from scene to scene. I don’t know if the ending was supposed to be scary or not, but it’s so laughably stupid that I can’t take it seriously. If the episode were intentionally comedic that’d be fine, but the rest of the episode is somewhat serious so the tonal shift at the end is jarring. Having said all that, the second act is unironically fantastic. The tension is palpable as our main character walks home to the ambient sounds of the continent he thought he left behind. That scene saves this otherwise very stupid episode.

31. **The Little People**: Remember how I thought most of the episodes in Season Two had interesting premises but lame execution? That’s The Little People. It’s a good thing that I take notes because I genuinely forgot about this episode, it’s easily the most forgettable of the season. This episode tried to invoke The Invaders, but The Invaders is an iconic episode because of its creative format rather than its plot. The Little People isn’t creative in its story or its presentation. Craig says in the beginning that his goal in life is to be a ruler of the masses, and the second he discovers the little people he turns into a megalomaniacal douche. This episode could have ended with the little people overthrowing Craig, cementing the fact that he’s not a god, but nope he just gets killed by giants because irony. This experiment in space psychology is undone by Craig’s over-the-top performance, he’s too ridiculous to be compelling.

30. **Person or Persons Unknown**: This episode sure does exist. The premise is self explanatory, a guy wakes up and nobody recognizes him. What took one sentence for me to describe is broken down and explained for what feels like the entire episode. There’s a long scene in the shrink’s office where the shrink tells us nothing we wouldn’t already know from what came before. As the conclusion drew nearer I kept thinking “don’t just be a dream, don’t just be a dream, don’t just be a GOD DAMMIT.” He wakes up and people can recognize him, but he can’t recognize anyone else. What a twist.

29. **A Piano in the House**: IF YOU LEAVE ME I’M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY! While that is obviously the best line in the history of television, this episode is more of a guilty pleasure than something I’d call good. Characters saying what’s in their minds when they hear a song is the antithesis of “show don’t tell”. The acting is really weird too. The actors are awkwardly stiff whenever they aren’t the center of attention, which makes sense because they’re trying to accentuate the moments when they “cut loose” so to speak, but it can be distracting. Having said all that, the moments when the characters DO cut loose are the best kind of campy. That doesn’t make this episode good, but I was thoroughly entertained.

28. **The Grave**: I’m gonna do something a bit different and talk about the man who wrote The Grave before talking about the episode itself. Montgomery Pittman wrote three episodes in Season Three before dying in 1962. Like any writer, he had his strengths and weaknesses. While he was a master of world-building and character development, his biggest weakness in my opinion was writing compelling dialogue (spoilers for my top ten I guess). That leads me to The Grave, my least favorite of his episodes. The Grave barely has a plot, it’s just a scary story to tell around a campfire. In fact, this story is just a Western version of a famous story called “The Graveyard Dare”. It’s fine enough for a simple horror story, but there’s not enough meat to fill the runtime. 2/3 of this episode takes place in the bar, and the dialogue goes on and on and on. The episode fades to black to mark the halfway point, and when they cut back they’re STILL in the damn bar. That kind of leads me to Pittman’s other weakness: pacing. The Grave’s pacing is absolutely abysmal. I’m all for a slow burn, but every scene just drags on to the point where any intriguing element is drowned out by sheer tedium. This episode does have its fans, and I guess if I looked past the pacing and the weak dialogue I could appreciate the Western aesthetic and spooky plot. Unfortunately, I can’t place this episode above the more well-rounded episodes from this season.

27. **The Fugitive**: In The Fugitive, an old man’s best friend is a young crippled girl. Setting aside the “stranger danger” element, this episode does have some sweet and wholesome moments. I can totally believe the friendship between Ben and Jenny, it isn’t weird at all in context, especially for 1962. But HOLY FUCK did this episode not age well. At one point he cures Jenny of her disability by laying her down on her bed and using a magical device on her, making her close her eyes as the girl says “will it hurt” and “be careful” with her visibly confused aunt right outside the door, and if you’ll excuse me I need to take the longest shower in the history of running water. It’s kind of amazing that two men try to kill a little girl and that’s not the part that aged horribly. All jokes aside, this episode isn’t ranked low because of how it aged. It’s a fine episode, but it gets way too sappy at times.

26. **Cavender is Coming**: Is this episode funny or has my brain finally turned to pudding after watching 100+ episodes? In any case, I did enjoy this episode quite a bit. I didn’t think I’d ever see a Twilight Zone episode where two different people throw themselves through windows, but here we are. This episode is a beat for beat remake of Mr. Bevis, so it gets no points for originality, but I do enjoy this one a lot more than Mr. Bevis. For starters, Carol Burnett brings Agnes to life with her trademark slapstick charm. Also, I really liked the decision to put Cavender himself in the spotlight. Most “guardian angel” stories only focus on the human, so it’s somewhat  unique to put the focus on the actual angel. As much as I do enjoy it, it’s still a typical “guardian angel” story, so the plot is about as run-of-the-mill as it gets (A Passage for Trumpet is exception when it comes to these types of stories). It’s not groundbreaking, but I enjoyed Cavender is Coming more than I had any right to.

25. **Showdown with Rance McGrew**: An actor who plays a badass on a TV show turns out to be a total pussy once he gets beaten up by the characters he’s pretending to be stronger. That’s not a great Twilight Zone premise, and it makes me wonder what Rod Serling really thought of his actors behind the scenes. Showdown With Rance McGrew was written back when Westerns were dominating the box office, so it isn’t the most relevant episode today. Imagine if Jordan Peele’s Twilight Zone skewered a “superhero actor” like Robert Downey Jr. or Hugh Jackman, it’d probably be entertaining as a parody but it’d definitely be dated in 60 years. That being said, I did enjoy the episode for what it was. There’s something about Jesse James taking the piss out of Rance that I found really funny. That doesn’t make it a great episode, a concept like this definitely has a ceiling for how good it can be, but I did have a good time watching this.

24. **Hocus-Pocus and Frisby**: Comedic episodes in the first two seasons almost never worked, but for some reason Season Three managed to make light-hearted episodes that were genuinely enjoyable. Submitted for your approval, Hocus-Pocus and Frisby. A bullshit artist named Frisby has to survive a real-life version of one of his tall tales. Plenty of Twilight Zone episodes were centered around liars and jackasses, but Frisby is a different kind of liar. He’s not an asshole, he’s just full of tall tales. He lies like your grandfather did when he told you the stories about how he saved the kids who got lost in the ball pit at the McDonald’s playpen (ok I may be projecting here). Point is, I kind of love how full of shit he is, and I also love how his friends know how full of shit he is but play along anyway. Aliens abduct him because they don’t understand the concept of lies on their home planet, classic comedic misunderstanding. This episode gets a lot of flak for its plot... yeah those people are right. I do enjoy this episode for what it is, but nothing about its story makes it a definitive Twilight Zone episode. But those creepy alien faces, now THAT is what this show is all about. So is it a great Twilight Zone episode? Not really, but I enjoy it anyway. There’s a place for light-hearted episodes that don’t really raise the bar for quality but are still enjoyable experiences.

23. **The Arrival**: Rod Serling’s opening monologue for The Arrival tells us that “we’ll get 90% of the puzzle pieces and the other 10% is up to us”. It’s a check that the rest of the episode can’t cash. After the plane and everyone else in the hangar disappears, the investigator gets told that “oh there was no plane you’re thinking of a different investigation”. What a lame way to end an otherwise captivating mystery. All things considered, I do enjoy this episode more than most people. The mystery of the missing passengers is mind-bending, and that scene in the hangar had me on the edge of my seat. If this episode were in Season Two I might have put it at in the top 15 because there is a lot to enjoy. The ending just didn’t deliver, and that really hurt this episode.

22. **Still Valley**: Elegy was a really bad episode, so when I saw that Still Valley was going to use the “frozen in time” concept I was worried. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised by how well they incorporated the frozen people into the episode. Instead of spending way too much time staring at still people like in Elegy, Still Valley only shows us the frozen army for a couple of minutes before moving on. It’s a good thing they did that because the effect isn’t that much better than it was in Elegy, but it doesn’t dominate the episode to a point where I can’t help but notice every blink or twitch. My biggest problem with Elegy wasn’t the shitty effects, it was the fact that the episode had no stakes and no reason to care for anyone or anything in the episode. Still Valley fixes that by giving the soldiers the power to freeze the Union and leaving the decision to use that power up to them. In the end they don’t decide to use that power because that wouldn’t make them any better than the “Damn Yankees”. It’s as simple as a story can get, but that’s not a bad thing in and of itself as long as the episode has a point. I may be giving this episode too much credit because it’s a much better version of an episode I hate, but Still Valley is good in its own right.

21. **The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank**: A+ title from our friend Mr. Montgomery Pittman, who wrote and directed this episode. The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank is a better display of Pittman’s strengths as a writer, especially when it comes to world-building. Pittman isn’t content to just have actors put on a southern accent and call it a day, he went out of his way to make the audience feel like they were in 1920’s America. That has just as much to do with his direction as it does his writing, so I’ll give him credit on both fronts. He created the perfect setting to tell this story, which is compelling enough. The “mysterious stranger” gimmick didn’t work in The Gift, but this episode took notes from The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street and tapped into the town’s fear of the unknown. Having said that, the dialogue is once again the weakest link of Pittman’s episode. Most of the dialogue boils down to “something’s up with Jeff”, and after a while I kept thinking “yes we get it can we move on”? Too much of this episode is dedicated to reminding us that Jeff is acting weird without actually showing us how Jeff is acting or giving us a reason why we should care if he’s a demon or not. Credit where it’s due, while I don’t think these characters were well written, the performances by the actors were excellent enough to draw my attention. This episode has a lot to appreciate, but it also has me wanting more. Part of me thinks the premise was too ambitious to tell in 25 minutes, and it’s a damn shame that Pittman didn’t get the chance to turn this into a movie or something along those lines. Also, what the hell was that closing monologue?

20. **One More Pallbearer**: One More Pallbearer is a revenge plot gone awry. Radin tries to extort the people who he believes have wronged him only to learn that they wouldn’t give him the time of day if he was the last motherfucker on Earth. Radin is the best kind of asshole, he’s confident enough to believe his own bullshit. He’s so petty that it’s satisfying to see his master plan fall through, he’s one of the few protagonists who I actively want to see fail but that’s also what makes the episode fun to watch. The ending gets a little too weird, I don’t think it needed to end with Radin having a psychotic breakdown, but I still recommend this one.

19. **Young Man’s Fancy**: “It takes a real boy to know a real stocking.” I’ll be referencing line for the rest of my life, alongside “IF YOU LEAVE ME I’M GOING TO BE VERY NAUGHTY”. The actual episode starts off slow. I understand the decision to make Virginia the central character, it’s through her perspective that we see Alex change from a man who can’t get over his mother to a literal child. Having said that, I wanted to spend more time with Alex. Walking Distance was a great episode because we got to understand Martin Sloan and get inside his brain, and I don’t think we got enough of that with Alex. I did predict that this Alex would become a child at the end, but I’ve always said that a predictable ending is fine as long as it’s executed well, and I’ll be damned if the end of Young Man’s Fancy isn’t one of the slickest scenes in the show. The house gradually turning back the clock and looking exactly how it did 25 years ago was outstanding.

18. **I Sing the Body Electric**: Ray Bradbury wrote the 100th episode of The Twilight Zone... meaning I’ve officially reviewed 100 of these... what the fuck am I doing with my life? Anyway, I Sing the Body Electric kind of has a Disney vibe to it, and that’s not just because of the Mary Poppins elephant in the room (this episode predates the movie by a few years but I digress). I loved the factory scene, it felt like Willy Wonka meets Frankenstein. That’s where the episode peaks, the rest of it is charming as hell but predictable. I do want to give the episode credit for writing child characters who serve as more than just props to move the episode along. Anne especially had a good deal of depth to her, having to balance the loss of her mother with her feelings towards Grandma. This episode is a bit on the sappy side, but it gets a lot more hate than it deserves.

17. **Five Characters in Search of an Exit**: I was really excited to watch Five Characters in Search of an Exit. I love shows and movies with a quirky premise, so this episode seemed right up my alley. After watching the episode I feel... underwhelmed. Don’t get me wrong it’s a good episode, but I wouldn’t call it one of the show’s best. Putting purposeful restrictions on an episode can lead to creative writing. The Invaders did this by not having any dialogue, and this episode placed five characters in a gray cylinder for the same reason. My problem with this episode is that it spends so much time building towards its twist that everything else that isn’t related to the twist is underdeveloped. As for the twist itself, I was underwhelmed. Some episodes are worth watching even knowing what the twist is, but this is one of those episodes where knowing the twist completely ruins the episodes so I won’t spoil it here. What I will say is that the twist doesn’t really enhance the rest of the episode like in Eye of the Beholder or To Serve Man. This episode does have excellent characters, engaging performances, and clever writing, so on those merits alone I can see why it’s a fan favorite. I just don’t know why it’s considered one of the definitive Twilight Zone episodes.

16. **The Passersby**: What is it with The Twilight Zone and The Confederacy? I don’t have a problem with it because the two Civil War themed episodes we got are good, but it’s weird seeing the Confederacy not be the villains in 2019 (I know this show was written in the 1960’s but you get my point). In any case, that doesn’t take anything away from The Passersby. I was able to figure out what the road symbolized pretty early on, the episode doesn’t exactly try to hide it. This episode has an outstanding set with a score that sets the mood perfectly. The scene with the soldier who lost part of his face is one of my favorites of the entire series, the visual of the light revealing his face is perfectly. The writing and acting are excellent, Lavinia’s is a very underappreciated character in my personal opinion. This is a haunting episode about death and loss set during America’s bloodiest conflict, and I don’t care what anyone says but Abraham Lincoln’s appearance at the end isn’t even slightly cheesy.

15. **Once Upon a Time**: I can see why people are divided on Once Upon a Time. It’s another comedy episode that can feel out of place in The Twilight Zone, especially if you’re not a fan of slapstick. What makes this episode stand out is the decision to present the 1890’s segments as if it were a silent film. I love this show because it can take me back to the 1960’s, but this episode managed to take me back even further in time. Even if you’re not a fan of silent-era comedy, you have to give it up for Buster Keaton. The man paid tribute to the genre he pioneered and he wasn’t even wearing pants for half the episode. The story doesn’t really matter, it only serves to get us from one gag to another. That wasn’t a problem for me because I thought this episode was hilarious, but if you the humor doesn’t work for you I can see why that would be an issue.

14. **The Hunt**: The Hunt is an episode about a dog, and for that alone it could have been Number One. In all seriousness, I couldn’t help but fall in love with Rip and the amazingly named Hyder Simpson. They have one of the most genuine connections between any two characters on this show, which is impressive because one of them is a freakin’ dog. Hyder isn’t a complex character, but his convictions are true; wherever he goes, Rip goes. It’s that decision that saves him from his own personal hell, and he’s rewarded with eternal bliss. Heaven is a never ending coon-hunt with your best buddy, something about that makes me smile every time.

13. **Little Girl Lost**: That final scene, my God. I knew that somebody was going into the fourth dimension at some point, but holy shit I did not expect that sequence to be so trippy. It’s the best kind of disorientating, you’re supposed to feel just as lost as Tina. Hell, the CAMERA turns upside down. Obviously technology has improved since 1962, but honestly that sequence still accomplished more than some modern movies that try to take us into an alternate dimension (Ant Man and The Wasp, for example). I think I’ve gushed enough about that one scene, let’s talk about the rest of the episode. Is it just me or was the father’s acting not all that great? He wasn’t expressive enough in my opinion. Also the writing gets a bit too technical at times, at a certain point I’m like “we get it this is an episode about science”. Those are just nitpicks though, I love the episode for its brilliantly creative ending.

12. **A Game of Pool**: Jack Klugman is still the best actor in the entire series, and he’s at the top of his game in A Game of Pool. This is probably the coolest Twilight Zone episode, I can see this being a personal favorite of someone like The Fonz or James Dean if you catch my drift. There’s something inherently fascinating about listening to two experts talk about their craft whether its in an interview, podcast, or anything else. A Game of Pool isn’t an episode about billiards, it’s an episode about what it means to be the best at what you do, even if it’s something as inherently meaningless as pool. Jack Klugman as Jesse Cardiff may steal the show, but Jonathan Winters as Fats Brown keeps up with him every step of the way. The combination of slick dialogue and outstanding acting is enough to make A Game of Pool a must watch for any fan.

11. **Nothing in the Dark**: I’ll be honest with you... I didn’t like Nothing in the Dark when I first watched it. I’m constantly updating these lists as I go, but to give you an idea of how much my opinion has changed about this episode, I originally had it at NUMBER THIRTY-ONE. I did have my reasons for not liking it, might as well get those out of the way now. No disrespect to Robert Redford, but I don’t think this role was right for him. He didn’t really disappear into the role until the final scene (and believe me I’m getting there). The issue might be with the character and not the actor, because this version of Mr. Death doesn’t hold a candle to Murray Hamilton’s portrayal in One for the Angels. I also get mixed signals at times. The message seems to be don’t hide from life because you’re afraid of dying because death is inevitable anyway, but the ending still has Wanda dying after wasting God knows how many years of her life. It’s a touching ending, but knowing that she wasted her golden years still bums me out. It’s sad, but not cathartic to me. With that first impression I was ready to dismiss Nothing in the Dark and move on with my life. Then I decided to look up reviews of this episode, and I didn’t know that some people consider this one of the best episodes of the series, if not the best overall. So I went ahead and watched it again, which was when I realized that this episode was loaded with symbolism. I’m not joking when I say that every element of this episode is connected to the themes of death and fear. The dilapidated apartment, the contractor scene, the fact that all of her neighbors have moved away, shit even the bars on her bed symbolize her self-imprisonment. Some of this symbolism was obvious at first, but I didn’t appreciate it fully until my second viewing. Also, that final scene. Robert Redford may not have been great for the episode as a whole, but oh my God did he absolutely nail that ending. Any problems I had with this episode vanished with this touching and, dare I say, beautiful ending.

10,"(Note: Spoilers abound across all eras of the Twilight Zone)

Compared to some other out-there anthology shows, Twilight Zone has often been considered more balanced and ""fair"" when stories end, particularly with twists. Shows like Outer Limits, for instance, are known to go out of the way to pull the rug under protagonists as a moment of shock and horror, surprise for the sake of surprise, while Twilight Zone is more known to do twists of more karmic retribution, or at least have poignant meaning behind them. The mad astronaut who tries to claim godhood over minuscule aliens gets treated to the flipside of the experience, a collection of crooks undone by a prophetic camera, aliens who manipulate a far-too-trusting humanity into surrendering for their recipes, or an old man losing a chance to regain youth due to stubborn refusal to believe and consider in kicking a can. 

In the era of Mr. Serling's direct involvement, endings at least tried to have a poetic weight of balance, or at least balanced warning over humanity's errs. That's not to say they all feel repeatably just; the man with time enough at last, for example, losing his ability to read for the folly of being happy with the end of humanity, in spite of a history of mistreatment. Or the boy with infinite power allowed to conjour people to cornfields and jack-in-the-boxes without consequence or obtrusion. Considering Serling was inspired by losing a friend in WWII when an Allied supply crate landed on top of him, sudden cruel twists can and would be reasonable to be sudden, cruel and without meaning. But with what was exercise and accomplished in most memorable tales, it almost feels like the Twilight Zone is best when it tries to keep balance in the final act.

Over the years, newer takes on the Twilight Zone err in going against this idea, and sometimes bring heroes to a downturn with less reasonable or nonexistent justification. The 80s revival brought us tales of trying to persuade aliens we aren't killers when it turns out that's exactly what they wanted of us, or a young woman trapped as a doll forever because a girl doesn't want her babysitters to leave. Or how with the movie adapting classic stories, it was felt that the seniors who found youth with kicking the can wouldn't truly be happy, and eventually go back to return to their old lives, a rejection of a positive magic based on an opposite interpretation of the original.

With this perspective, Mr. Peele's return of us to the Twilight Zone appears to be a mixed approach in delivering karma to the people caught up in the dimension of sound, sight and mind. The campaign man who allowed a devious wunderkind to take the White House feels can be seen as a tale of ""you reap what you sow"", his end an ironic creation of his own in thinking of playing government bureaucracy off as a dramatic challenge of his skill. The comedian finding himself with powerfully erasive stand-up speeches is driven to take himself away out of guilt, is more of a tragedy of temptation and warning of power and responsibility. The man whose prophetic podcast left him in a nightmare at 30,000 feet is a strange inverse of the original tale, cautioning against extreme assumption and disruptive actions that create the accident he tried to correct, as opposed to when Shatner took matters into his own hands to stop the sabotage of gremlins. The understanding of a ""just"" ending might even be giving way to Peele seeking to acknowledge that life itself is more injust than Sterling's stories often were. The final ending for the mother whose replay camera broke just after all that she suffered, or the refugee of the parallel dimension unable to evade the deporting organization,  show a lack of justice that serves as a warning of truth outside the Twilight Zone, an overt reminder of reality for the viewer.

It's human nature to prefer a happy ending and detest a sad one, but the balance of executing them is always in question. Any ending can be enjoyable with proper meaning or gravitas, applying this is more important than the events of the ending itself. Peele's most famous excursion in unordinary horror with the film ""Get Out"" produced two endings; one with the hero overcoming his captors with the help of law enforcement, the other where law enforcement turns on him due to racial profiling. Both could be considered meaningful and satisfactory, but individual preference can and does stir debate over which would work better. For both the Twilight Zone and other realms of fiction, endings need to have weight and logic of a sort, and not simply be done for a simple reason of happiness, realism, or twists for the sake of twists. Hopefully as the show goes on in its current form, this pattern continues, whether it's the sense of karmic morality Serling's era utilized, or unfair modern realism that Peele's era can poetically work into the themes of the story.",Drewsko199,"""Just"" Endings in the Twilight Zone",1563907006,1,True,TwilightZone,2019-07-23

Now on the MP, MP wakes up on the ground and looks around. Realizing they are lost they get up only to hear something all around them
MP breaks into a run through the woods when all of a sudden they break into a trance as they hear a ""park ranger""  calling their name. The MP looks to wear the sound is coming from and slowly begins to walk towards it uneasily. 
Real PR is revealed to be far away from MP
PR radios into HQ saying he is following tracks but will turn back after dark. 
PR takes a couple more steps when he also breaks into a trance. 
PR hears the ""missing person"" calling for help and the PR runs towards the sound before stopping after breaking from the trance. 
PR listens closely and hears the sound is looping.
PR still hears the noise and begins to make his way towards the noise gun drawn. 

MP begins to jog towards the noise crying out for help and slows as the sound is louder than ever. 

PR stops going towards the loop as he hears the real MP
PR runs toward the MP 
PR breaks out from the brush and sees the MP calling out for the sound to come save her
PR calls out to MP that the sound is fake and just a trick to lure her to the ""something"" 
MP falls in and out of the trance talking to the PR and the ""something"" 
The sound grows louder and louder until the PR and MP finally grab hands
The pair walk back to ""safety""

3,"Just like everyone here I felt the new series was a bit too on the nose, and it was constantly sacrificing the dreadful fantasy we enjoy for the social commentary it was blatantly trying to convey. It was hard to connect with the characters because the original series used to be an escape into another dimension, whereas the new stories felt contrived to keep a certain political message/lessoj in focus during each episode.

""Blurryman"" changes this opinion for me, as I think it's a codex to the riddle of how the fuck could a talent like JP could authorize production of such cheese.

Heck, it even somewhat cheaply uses Rod Serling as a plot device in an obvious invitation to re-watch previous episodes. The B&amp;W release is another clue, not just a commercial move.

After some thought I realized the campfire stories metaphor after the 4th wall break is JP's way of telling us, ""hey I had to do it."" The creators and starry casting are all eager to tell us how they feel about current issues, but there was no way to do it, even in a sci-fi setting, without drawing parallels to real people and real problems. JP knew the cheese hard to be served hot and in your face - for example the camera work has been mainly focused on close-ups of reaction shots instead of wide shots. This is a clever way to save money on set budget, but also glued the viewer on the characters' humanity, instead of presenting a difficult logic scenario for the viewer to question.

To our frustration the characters didn't always make smart or totally natural decisions, despite being emotionally relatable. Maybe like me you also feel a bit trolled by JP's decision to fall back on social horror instead of oddball sci-fi, but I have to respect the wit behind such a move.

Think about it - the Twilight Zone is a powerful license that has huge expectations. CBS probably agreed to let JP use this license to lure in viewers expecting more of the same, an escape from reality, but he just showed us modern day people in a twisted setting that emboldened their emotions yet altered their scope of decision-making. We are meant to say ""this is nothing but tripe, nothing new to see here.""

However, if such dramatic social horror is the norm, shouldn't we be a little scared? Scared of ourselves? *The Comedian* is an obvious example, but the captain of the space shuttle hit too close to home for me, as someone who's worked as a manager before. To expect good twisted sci-fi we were shortchaged, but **""Blurrymen"" made it clear that this was perhaps their intention.**

*** Black Mirror was a cult Brit show from Brooker that was picked up by Netflix before it became widely known. Twilight Zone is an American classic with generations of followers airing on CBS. The creators, I feel, are using the platform to show us a Twilight Zone dimensions where shows suck, and we can't get out of the necessary humanity writing needs to be grounded in, in turn unable to turn away from our own reality.

4,"I've been binging Alfred Hitchcock Presents recently, as I'm always trying to find a new show to watch that captures the vibes that The Twilight Zone gave me since I finished that so long ago.  I even went through all of Tales From The Crypt over the last little while, and now that I've moved onto this classic, I wanted to sum up what I think of both series in comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

AHP seems less interesting in plot than TTZ and more emotion-based.  The cinematography is top of the line (obviously), but the overall look seems cheaper than TTZ.  Don't get me wrong, AHP has it's strengths when lined up to TTZ, but I've yet to find an episode that wows me like many Tales From The Crypt, or even Night Visions episodes have.  Luckily, the actors are magnificent in both, and their performances keep me excited for each episode.

I understand they changed it because ""man"" and ""he"" excludes 50% of the population. But changing it to ""one"" shows a fundamental misinterpretation of the original message.

It wasn't referring to any individual's fears or knowledge, rather it meant humanity's fears and knowledge. It was a collective noun, even if they used ""man"" instead of ""mankind"". It kind of sets the tone for uniting us in our common humanity; and that the new show changed it to ""one"", a singular noun, suggests they missed that important theme.

I mean on a basic fundamental level this is the most narcissistic ignorant worst writing I’ve ever seen in my entire life on television. The writers of the show are so full of themselves that they thought we wanted to watch an entire episode about them working??? This is probably one of the worst episodes of television in television history. This was the worst pieces of garbage I have ever seen in my entire life, I cannot believe how terrible this version of the twilight zone is!!

How dare these people put the name twilight zone onto this garbage! This is so far from what the original twilight zone was. 

All of the political messages, all of the “deep meaning” and “art” that this show tries the stuff down my throat every night is the most BuzzFeed worthy, Tumblrina, pathetic entitled crybaby gobltyguk, that I have had to ever be subjected to in my entire life.

I cannot believe in this 10th episode these buttholes had the nerve to write an episode about how they are not just making “campfire stories” but they are making “art” virtue signaling like they were trying to get off a deserted island.

I can’t even comprehend how they had the nerve to create a CG Rod Sterling! what the fuck does this show think it is?? Some bastion of holy creativity?! This this just a circle jerk for these writers (that are about as deep and edgy as a 14 year old from 2004) to stroke each others egos. Jesus Christ.

This Jordan Peele guy is a hack I can’t believe that he put his name on this trash show what a joke.

The dudes only appearance on this episode is walking and talking like it’s some kind of daytime nock off west wing quality drama from the 1990s?!

26,"*""Let them sit in there tootin' on their harps or whatever they do for relaxation.  Me and youse stays together.  Just like we was when we was traveling down below.""* \- Hyder

&amp;#x200B;

This episode is so quaint.  That's the word of the day.  It's like an Asher Durand painting.  It's refreshing to see this relaxed, woodsy atmosphere in a show that normally finds itself entrenched in a concrete jungle.  When I think of natural settings in the Twilight Zone I often go to the dead canyons of space or the blood-soaked jungles of the Pacific theater - which are great settings, but strike markedly different tones from The Hunt.  Just watching Hyder and Rip crawling through the forest with frogs and crickets chirping sends a smile across my face.  Even if it's not your cup of coke I find that one of the Twilight Zone's major strengths is how it can tell a whole jambalaya of unique and interesting stories.  There's certainly plenty of episodes similar to The Hunt that you could draw comparisons to - and we will - but it'll always have its own distinct southern-fried flavor.  Away, bound away, 'cross the wide Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

It shouldn't be too surprising that this episode's quirks come from the mind of one Earl Hamner Jr., oldest of 8 who grew up in rural Virginia during the Great Depression.  Much of Hyder's character seems to draw from Earl Hamner Sr., who accidentally shot his own hunting dog and spent days searching for him.  He wasn't much of a church man either - spending his Sundays drinking, fishing, and hunting.  It's also worth mentioning that Hamner already had these ""old man"" and ""old woman"" characters in a series of short stories that eventually formed the archetypes for Grandpa and Grandma Walton in the hit TV show, *The Waltons.*  This is but another chapter in the Hamner Cinematic Universe.  I actually thought it was really cute how Hyder and Rachel referred to each other as ""old woman"" and ""old man"" but it works to their advantage as their characters already feel developed and we're just peeking into their lives.  The opening scene does a great job at giving us a feel for these characters and their lifestyle.  Really love the set design on the cabin.

The eponymous hunt is over with pretty quickly.  I get that most people probably don't love this setting as much as I do but darn it, can't we just watch a man having fun with his dog?  Also, with all the hubbub it's easy to forget that Hyder dies trying to save Rip.  He mentioned earlier that Rip saved his life once, showing that that feeling is mutual.  It's often tricky to show a relationship between two characters when one of them is mute but I think it's portrayed beautifully here.  Enter gag time.  Boy am I not fond of gag time.  Most people are probably aware that Hyder and Rip are dead.  They are bereft of life, pushing up daisies, their metabolic processes now history.  We had all the telltale signs - the bloody moon, the sleepy bird, and the lingering shot on the bubbling water with that sad musical sting.  *Also, the neighbors tell us.*  Hyder takes a comically long amount of time to figure this out, and this is where the episode really feels padded.  This was originally a 12-minute short on *The Kate Smith Hour* that seems to be lost media sans [one clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9TCBemCsQw)  Given this and some of Hamner's comments on Hunnicut's performance, you can tell that his original vision was a lot goofier.  I go back and forth on this one - because I like the emotional undercurrent of the episode and I think you could balance out the lighter and darker elements but the problem is that it doesn't commit to either.  Once we get into Act 3 we basically forget about all the sadness and get into goofy parable territory.  Given the type of story Hamner's trying to tell it would've been better to condense the funeral and dedicate more time to the hunt itself or guiding Hyder towards the gates of hell, which he sorta just stumbles into.  Preserving the ending in a more serious story would be tricky - maybe have Hyder distraught about dying and turning to his dog for consolation while devil gatekeeper preys on this - and when he tries to separate them Hyder erupts into a fit of rage, in this big emotional climax.  As it stands, the episode is just here and there and doesn't manage much comedically or emotionally.  I think it hits the sentimental beats well enough but there isn't really much beyond that.  It's really jarring when the pallbearers carry his coffin in front of his grieving wife and Hyder's just standing there clamoring *""Who's in that box?""*  I get that he's in denial but it just drags and drags.  I'm getting *Nightmare as a Child* vibes.  But at least that episode knows what it wants to be.  Heck, even in *A Passage for Trumpet* Joey concludes that he's dead in half the time, allowing the episode to flow a lot more smoothly.  Slow pacing can work with purpose, but this is like a jar of molasses with flies stuck inside.  Ick.

And in the most jarring of twists, this episode comes out as a religious parable.  The Twilight Zone has always had Christian leanings, especially in death-centric episodes.  I prefer the *Nothing in the Dark* approach myself but it's understandable given how many Christian households make up the Twilight Zone's demographic.  It's pretty solid as far as parables go - Hyder's love and dedication towards Rip results in Rip saving him from Hell.  There's the weird implication that people without dogs are just auto-damned but I don't really see it that way.  If there's one thing the extended gag time does it shows us how much Hyder cares for the people around him.  He allows the grieving neighbors to dig on his property.  He has a loving relationship with his wife and even asks if she'll find her way to Heaven - suggesting that it's not just about the dog, it's about being a good, decent person who won't sell out loved ones for the promise of heavenly rewards.  You can see that Earl loved his father and believes he deserves to be in Heaven, despite his lack of faith.

And finally, it's time to talk about the portrayal of angels and devils in this episode.  The gate devil has a Brooklyn accent and comes off as disingenuous whereas the angel's a down-to-earth country boy who don't need no fancy wings.  When Hyder sits down on Eternity Road he muses about how ""Heaven"" is mostly full of city folk who disapprove of 'coon hunting.  And the episode seems to agree with his thesis.  Honestly, I kind of wish they played this straight.  What if Heaven actually didn't allow dogs?  Wouldn't that be so much more poignant and powerful?  It doubles as commentary on how you have to conform to some degree when you enter certain institutions.  By sticking to his principles, Hyder casts off Heaven in a Lilithian fashion.  And if you want to keep the happy ending you can have Hyder walk along Eternity Road for a while only stumble into more wayward dog-owners, saying that they'll make their own heaven.  I mean, there's already some debate on whether dogs have souls or not.  I get Hamner is a good Christian boy who wouldn't pen something so blasphemous but I dunno, I think that'd be pretty neat.  Also, it's weird to me that dogs get into Heaven but raccoons are just there to be hunted.  Kinda bites, don't it?  You could wave this whole paragraph by saying this is just Hyder's own *personal heaven*, like Rocky's personal Hell from *A Nice Place to Visit*.  That's a good way to make peace.

&amp;#x200B;

The Hunt is a strange entry in the Twilight Zone where Hamner's voice shines through.  The lack of spooky cars and spooky pianos makes it clear that this wasn't really written to be a Twilight Zone episode.  Everybody has their own ideas of what a Twilight Zone episode is and this episode certainly breaks the mold for me.  It's almost like Act 2 was purposefully designed to make this episode fit in better - which would be totally unnecessary.  Does this episode venture into Christian broadcasting territory?  Yeah, but at the center lies a sense of love and humanitarianism that undoubtedly belongs in the Twilight Zone.",nulldrone,The Groan Zone - The Hunt,1559931262,1,True,TwilightZone,2019-06-07

2," *""And the man caught her, and he choked her.  Helen, remember?  He choked her.  Then he picked up something heavy and he hit her on the head.  Then she fell.  And then you screamed.  And the man looked at you.  The man looked at you.  Then you screamed so loud, Helen.  You screamed so loud.""* \- Markie

&amp;#x200B;

Children are creepy.  The way they slop their boogers all over your shirt and delight in stepping on your toes.  Their fascination with poop and nudity.  The way they turn on a dime.  The realization that this was once you.  But enough about my Fridays.  The Twilight Zone manages to make children creepy by making them as un-childlike as possible.  Despite the anecdotal evidence, children are still regarded as innocent, naive, and full of wonder.  It's just plain fun to watch a child grow and learn things about the world.  The Twilight Zone spins this on its li'l head by giving them dark, brooding attributes for some major spooky juxtaposition.  Anthony Fremont's the little dude with all the gnarly powers.  Markie has a weird disposition and knows an awful a lot about Helen Foley - even more than Helen herself.  But every child, adult, and old man turned into a child are but blastocysts floating around in the petri dish that we have labeled the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Helen is weird.  She isn't creeped out at all when this mysterious little girl professes to know everything about her, right down to the scars on her skin.  In fact, she invites her in for drinks.  It's a little funny that there's a sting after Markie exclaims that Helen doesn't like marshmallows.  Oh god, how did she know?!  The dramatic stings are way off this episode.  You could write that off as Helen being overly friendly because she knows a lot about children and works with them daily - and besides, Markie's own weirdness overshadows this.  Helen's lack of concern over the disturbing wealth of information Markie has on her makes me think she'd be an easy target for being stalked.

There's plenty of little hints about Markie's identity.  You don't have to be a Wikipedia aficionado to be suspicious that they like their hot chocolate the same way.  And this might just be hindsight but I swear they have similar facial structures and Markie talks with that same soft cadence that Helen has.  And Markie is constantly urging Helen on to realize this.  Like the double meaning when Markie asks *""Do people look familiar to you sometimes?""*  It's kind of baffling that Helen blocked out what she used to look like.  I wish we got more insight into what Helen's daily routine and how her life has been altered.

Enter Peter Selden.  He's got those bored, baggy eyes with a sleazy, toothy smile underneath.  *Are these the teeth of a childhood friend?*  But Helen doesn't pick up on any of this.  She's kind of doofy and willing to let anybody into her apartment.  And we as the audience get an impending sense of danger - that she's sitting alone with a probable murderer in a tiny room and has this confused, defenseless air to her.  When he reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a childhood photo of her and talks about what a beautiful child she was - all the creep alarms are going off.  He literally said he had a crush on her as a child.  But she doesn't react to this at all.  She just furrows her brow and has that same confused stare.  It's nerve-wracking.

About halfway in, Selden spells it out - Markie was Helen's childhood nickname.  It's weird that Selden's going out of his way to jog her memory but I guess he was planning on murdering her anyway.  This is a problem with all amnesiac stories, especially on rewatch - it's painfully obvious to us what's going on but she just stands there with that dumb look on her face.  Markie is an audience surrogate in this way - she's constantly urging Helen to remember who she is and this progresses throughout the episode.  Eventually she gets fed up and tells Helen everything point blank.  I love how she describes it in this snappy child way, echoing Helen's mental process.  Terry Burnham was great here.  What's with child actors stealing the show?  She's sort of constrained by being this ""solemn wise girl"" but we get cute moments like when she smiles and goes ""Really?"" while jogging Helen's memory and how she immediately flees when Selden arrives.  Helen was frightened when she saw Selden in his car without even recognizing him, so there's some more memory shenanigans going on.  Shepperd Strudwick does alright with his spooky murderer shtick and some of his subtle reaction-gauging works well to add tension.  Unfortunately Janice Rule is stuck being a confused mess most of the episode but I liked her interactions with Markie and how her face convulsed upon finally remembering.  And we get a surprise cut to Selden because Helen never closed the door.  Little things like this make you feel for Helen as somebody with a mental block that makes her as helpless as a child.

Now the way Selden's death is choreographed is a little silly.  Some might argue she shouldn't be able to overpower him and the way the scene's shot is unintentionally hilarious.  It's like she gently nudges him and he falls down a flight of stairs like a slinky.  And then the doctor and the lieutenant literally go out of their way explain to us what Markie was meant to represent.  Come on, Rod.  Give your audience some credit.  Imagine if at the end of *The Hitch-Hiker* a mortician randomly drives up and said ""Yep, looks like that creepy omnipresent guy was Death all along.  Guess this was supposed to represent her inability to accept death, or something.""  Jeez.  This episode has a real problem with expository dialogue.  And I get it, someone who goes through trauma has that stuff blocked out.  I didn't mind when Markie did it but I wish Selden was a little less blunt and that doctor/lieutenant nonsense should've been cut out entirely.  Not a fan.

The actual ending is sweet.  Some people might find it too schmaltzy but given the peril Helen's gone through her entire life I think she deserves it.  This highlights her kind nature, remembering her warmness towards children from the beginning.  And when she compliments the girl with the Talky Tina on how lovely her smile is we see how Helen regains her own smile, finally freeing Markie of her solemnitude.

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of those rare instances where the supernatural element isn't the main source of conflict - rather, it's there to help guide the protagonist through their journey.  Peter Selden is a realistic murderer outside of his supernatural tendency for exposition which gives this episode a dark edge.  Now Helen can get kind of annoying as we overdose on dramatic irony but ultimately she's sympathetic enough to root for.  This episode has its share of problems and I think the way it unfolds leaves a lot to be desired.  But I like what it was going for and I just plain like Markie as a character.  I kinda wish we just had a scene of Helen and Markie chilling and comparing burn creams.  Much like Helen herself, it's meandering and sometimes frustrating but it has its heart in the right place.  Also I liked the composition of Helen's memory and how Twinkle Twinkle Little Star was a mantra of sorts to help Helen remember, it reminds me of neurons firing off.  There's also a weird thing where they cut between Helen and Markie/Selden's faces and Helen's background is blurred, disorienting us and getting us to feel for her more.  I'm not sure if that was intentional, but interesting if so.",nulldrone,The Groan Zone - Nightmare as a Child,1558829102,6,True,TwilightZone,2019-05-25
3,"Hello. Longtime lurker of the subreddit, huge fan of the OG Twilight Zone, and I just had a theory: what if the diner from *Replay* is the same diner from *Nick of Time*?



My theory goes all the way back to the events of *Nick of Time*. After those events, something occured at the diner, causing it do get destroyed. Years later, the diner was recreated, and had only one of the *Nick of Time* machines placed into it, possibly because it was the only machine left after the original diner was destroyed. However, they investigated the machine after reports came in about its powers (this too is after the events of *Nick of Time*), and were able to make it a simple decoration. If this theory is correct, this means that the diner we are in during the events of *Replay* is a recreation of the original diner from *Nick of Time*.

7,"Have you ever listened to The White Album in its entirety? Everyone knows classics While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Birthday, but the album has a lot of filler songs that are, quite frankly, shit. For every Happiness is a Warm Gun, there’s a Revolution 9. That’s kind of how I feel about Season 2. There’s a sharp divide in quality; the good episodes are great, and the bad episodes are REALLY bad. As I kept watching, I couldn’t figure out why episodes were so hit and miss, but then I had an epiphany. To put it one way, the episodes at the top of this list went out of their way to capitalize on their premises and create a memorable experience. On the other hand, you had episodes that had interesting setups but couldn’t stick the landing, which can be frustrating knowing what this show is capable of. I guess you could say that, compared to the first season, Season 2 had a lower floor but a much higher ceiling, and you’ll find out why in just a moment.

29. **The Whole Truth**: This episode ends with a joke about Khrushchev being tricked into buying a car that forces him to tell the truth, and for that it’s going to hell. I’m sure the ending killed in 1960, but in 2019 it’s just dated. As a whole, the episode never goes beyond its one-note joke, but the ending not only makes it the worst episode of the season, but quite possibly the worst of the series.

28. **A Thing About Machines**: A Thing About Machines is somehow more boring than its title. A man getting attacked by household appliances shouldn’t be less interesting than watching your grandfather yell at his flip-phone, but here we are. The only good part of this episode is Rod Serling giving his opening monologue from a TV screen. As much as I love Rod, he shouldn’t be the only part of an episode that I can look at and say “yeah I did like that”.

27. **The Man in the Bottle**: This episode has a tone problem. The second wish has Arthur wish for a million dollars only to have it taxed away, which is almost too realistic to be entertaining. The third wish turns him into Hitler. With his fourth wish, everything returns to normal and there’s an “oh shucks I guess everything worked out in the end” vibe, but I’m sorry can we go back to the part where a man literally became Adolf Hitler? That’s not a twist, that’s a parody of a twist. As for the rest of the episode, it’s a story about a genie so it’s exactly what you’d expect, but I didn’t expect to see Godwin’s Law in the Twilight Zone.

26. **Static**: Oh boy, I finally get to talk about the episodes that were shot to tape instead of filmed normally. It was a cost cutting measure that all but ruined the six episodes it was used it, and Static is the worst of them all. Ever play a game on an old PC where you have to bring the graphics to their lowest settings, and even then the framerate still lags? That’s what watching Static is like. The story is basically Sixteen Millimeter Shrine but worse, which leads me to a tangent: a lot of episodes this season were nearly identical to one’s Season 1, and very rarely did they improve on the original. There isn’t nothing to like about Static, but the cons heavily outweigh any pros here.

25. **The Mind and the Matter**: I’m not saying Rod didn’t have a sense of humor, but he should have stuck to dramas. What we have here is an episode that tries to be fun and light-hearted but just... isn’t. I do like the twist that most certainly inspired Being John Malkovich, but that’s about it. That’s my problem with Season 2, episodes don’t suck in a unique way that’s fun to talk about, they just suck.

24. **The Lateness of the Hour**: Here we have another episode ruined by its experimental filming, but that’s not the only thing going on here. I had a really hard time coming up with words to describe how I feel about The Lateness of the Hour, but I know I can’t just say “it’s bad” and leave it at that. I had to watch this episode twice because I couldn’t figure out why I should care about Jana. The story is really simple, but the execution wasn’t consistent at all. Each scene felt like it belonged in a different episode, which is weird because there’s nothing too complex going on here. The twist is fine I guess, but if I don’t care about the first 23 minutes the last 2 aren’t going to change much.

23. **The Trouble With Templeton**: It’s Walking Distance but worse. There, I’ve said all I had to say about this episode. Besides the scene where Templeton leaves and all of the ghosts stop acting as the lights fade (which is admittedly really good), nothing stands out. Nothing else blew me away, but nothing particularly sucked either. It’s as neutral as an episode of The Twilight Zone can get.

22. **The Silence**: In my first list I said that Mirror Image was an episode that I didn’t understand why people liked, and Season 2’s equivalent is The Silence. The premise is honestly really good, a man has to stay silent for a year, and the twist ending could have been shockingly effective. There’s really only one flaw with this episode, but it’s a flaw that ruins everything: it doesn’t feel like he stayed silent for a whole year. We spend very little time with Tennyson when he’s alone in his room, and the timeline jumps ahead months at a time. He could have been in there for a week for all we know, and that’s bad news for an episode that needs to sell us on his suffering. Of all the episodes so far, this one had the most potential to be good, maybe a longer running time would have helped.

21. **Back There**: The first half of Back There is really good, I love how the philosophy behind the episode is laid out in what is essentially a group of guys shooting the shit over a game of cards. John Wilkes Booth as a cartoony OTT villain is surprisingly entertaining. Peter, on the other hand, doesn’t really have a character. He’s about as average as a protagonist can get, and I couldn’t get invested in him. As strong as the episode started, it just sort of fizzled out in the end. What we have here is an episode with a lot of good qualities that isn’t better than the sum of its parts. There’s outstanding concepts going on, but the execution doesn’t do any of them justice.

20. **Dust**: Dust in an episode with a lot of good elements. The final third in particular was really well done, from the father hopelessly throwing dust at his son to one of Rod Serling’s best closing monologues. I only have one major flaw with the episode, but like The Silence it’s a critical flaw. The main character is a convicted child murderer who basically walked away with no punishment. The theme of forgiveness is a powerful one, but it would have worked so much better if Luis was wrongly convicted, or at least guilty of a much less heinous crime. I know that the point of this episode was to challenge our conceptions of punishment, and I didn’t exactly want Luis to hang, but he’s not a character where I can say “yeah he deserves to walk away with no sentence”. If you can get past that then you’ll enjoy Dust a lot more than I did.

19. **The Odyssey of Flight 33**: I wanted this to be a lot better than it was, but Flight 33 comes nowhere close to reaching its potential. It’s an episode so wrapped up in asking “why is this happening” without giving us a reason to care. And When the Sky Was Opened was an episode where you didn’t know why the astronauts were disappearing, but the concept and characters were so intriguing that you can’t help but be engaged. Flight 33 focused more on having realistic pilot lingo than making the pilots interesting. There was one scene with two of the passengers talking, and I think more scenes like that would have made me invested in their plight. I have no reason to care that the plane is gonna Quantum Leap for all eternity, which sucks because that concept could have made for a much better episode.

18. **The Prime Mover**: Fine concept, bad execution. I really have nothing more to say about The Prime Mover. I hope you’re noticing a theme here, because I could probably say that about all of these episodes so far. In Season 1 we had episodes like Elegy that tried and failed, but I feel like a lot of these episodes fail to try. Was gambling really the best plot they came up with, because that’s boring as hell. The message at the end is decent, and the opening scene was really well done, but I expect more from this show.

17. **A Most Unusual Camera**: Have you ever read the Goosebumps book “Say Cheese and Die”? This episode is essentially that. It’s a fun concept that leads to some interesting scenes, but the episode doesn’t really know how to end the story. The three leads and the doorman dying was played for laughs in a way, and while this episode isn’t exactly serious, the light-hearted tone just feels off.

16. **Mr. Dingle the Strong**: Comedy and The Twilight Zone are like toothpaste and orange juice most of the time. A lot of people actually consider Mr. Dingle to be one of the worst episodes... I actually love it. You can’t expect any amount of seriousness from an episode where the main character is named Dingle, and this episode leans in to the absurdity. Two-headed Martians and midget Venusians take a lot of pleasure in messing with Mr. Dingle because of how cookie-cutter he is, and that’s so funny to me. The humor is not for everyone, but nobody can deny Burgess Meredith’s natural charm. He’s the best part of the episode by a long shot, the whole thing probably wouldn’t have worked without him. It’s not high art, but this episode is better than it had any right to be, and I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

15. **The Howling Man**: I actually didn’t like The Howling Man when I first watched it. The pacing feels way too fast, and maybe it’s just me but Ellington’s performance kind of sucked. A lot of the episode is just telling you what happened/is happening, which is weird in a show that masters “show don’t tell”. What finally sold me on this episode was how creative it was. The set design, the concept, and the brilliant costume design make for an enjoyable viewing experience. A few entries ago I bashed episodes that I didn’t think tried to be interesting, but here I’m going to applaud The Howling Man for its creativity, even though it can be messy at times.

14. **A Penny for Your Thoughts**: This episode reminds me a lot of Mr. Bevis from Season 1, but this episode isn’t cheesy as hell. I actually thought Hector was played by the same actor as Mr. Bevis at first, but I was wrong. Dick York’s natural charm is the highlight of this episode, and his warm presence made this light-hearted tale work. It doesn’t reach the heights of more iconic episodes, but I recommend this one if you’re in the mood for something light.

13. **Twenty-Two**: There’s a theory that audiences only remember the beginning and end of anything they watch, and if that were 100% accurate then Twenty-Two would be remembered as one of the best episodes. The opening scene is terrifying, and I didn’t see the twist coming at all. So why isn’t this higher up? Because nothing that happens between those scenes matters at all. You could edit out the entire episode besides those two scenes and have an outstanding 5 minute short film. But I can’t get over the fact that 90% of this episode is meaningless.

12. **A Hundred Yards Over the Rim**: Remember The Last Flight? This episode is almost exactly like that. Having said that, this episode worked in ways that The Last Flight didn’t. The stakes here are more believable, and it does a better job of distinguishing the past from the present. It’s not aesthetically beautiful by any means, but the visual storytelling here is a lot more dynamic than it was in The Last Flight. This episode isn’t just good in comparison to its predecessor, it’s good on its own merits too, but it’s easier to talk about why it’s good when you have this context.

11. **The Rip Van Winkle Caper**: Much like the last episode, The Rip Van Winkle Caper took some notes from Season 1. Specifically, this episode is almost identical to I Shot an Arrow Into The Air apart from the twist. I actually like this ending more than Arrow’s, finding out that what they’ve sacrificed everything for is worthless is one of my favorite ways to end an episode. That’s about the only thing that Caper does better, though. A lot of what I loved about Arrow is in this episode, but the execution of those same elements wasn’t as spectacular. Farwell bashing DeCruz with a bar of gold doesn’t have the same intensity as Corey shooting Donlin through his canteen. Caper is still a good episode, but I wouldn’t recommend it over Arrow.

10. **Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room**: I’ve been pretty negative so far, and I don’t like talking like that about The Twilight Zone. The top ten episodes of this season are the ones that remind me just how much I love this show, starting with Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room. Eat your heart out, MJ, this is what it’s like to talk to the man in the mirror. I don’t know if calling this a one-man show is entirely accurate, since Joe Mantell was pulling double-duty, but in any case I loved his performance(s). The mirror effect didn’t age perfectly, but I never found it lame or dated. This was such a creative way of visualizing internal conflict, and it was pulled off masterfully.

9. **King Nine Will Not Return**: No, I didn’t put King Nine 9th on purpose. Much like the pilot of Season 1, King Nine features a deserted man with no clue of why he’s in this situation. I wouldn’t say that this is identical to Where Is Everybody, but it’s a different way to tell the same story. Bob Cummings was outstanding as Embry, I could feel his loneliness and desperation in every scene. This episode took a unique interpretation of survivor’s guilt, but it’s still relatable to the audience. That’s not easy to do, yet King Nine made it work.

8. **Night of the Meek**: Christmas, Twilight Zone style. I’ll gladly put this in my holiday rotation, because Rod Serling managed to capture the magic of the season without sacrificing emotion. I’ll never love the “shot to tape” format, but Night of the Meek managed to work around it and create an aesthetic that somehow works with the style. Art Carney is charming as hell, which is fitting because the whole episode is charming as hell. It’s one of the few episodes that genuinely put a smile on my face, and I can’t wait to watch it again in December.

7. **Long Distance Call**: You could interpret this episode in one of two ways: you can take it at face value and see it as the grandmother actually communicating from beyond the grave, or you can be like me and see it as the grievers just hearing what they “want” to hear. We never hear her voice over the phone, and that decision was enough to let my imagination take over. Everyone talks about Bill Mumy’s amazing performance, but am I the only one who was absolutely gutted by the father’s speech when he believes he’s talking to his dead mother? This is a well acted, beautifully written story about loss, and I love it.

6. **Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up**: Any Rush fans in the house? Anyone who’s heard their song Twilight Zone knows the final reveal, which is rightfully one of the most iconic images of the series. The rest of the episode is a classic whodunnit, and while I wish some of the passengers were more involved in the story, it’s still a classic of the genre. The final scene is what makes this episode famous, and I have nothing more to add besides saying that it’s as good as everyone says it is.

5. **Nick of Time**: I didn’t understand what the title meant until the ending, which put everything we saw into a whole new light. Realizing just how close Don and Pat came to becoming “enslaved by the tyranny of fear and superstition” was mind blowing. It’s the kind of twist that turns an already solid episode into a masterpiece, and I’m really glad I didn’t know anything about it going in.

4. **The Invaders**: This episode left me speechless, pun absolutely intended. Modern writers love having silent episodes as an experiment, but I didn’t expect to see one from 60 years ago. Agnes Moorhead carries this episode not through her relatable character, but through pure fear and tension. Since I can’t exactly compliment the writing, I’m gonna give a lot of praise to the director who made every scene perfect without dialogue. One thing that I missed in Season 2 was the Space Age atmosphere, since a lot of my favorite episodes from last season dealt with attitudes, hopes, and fears that mankind had at the time. The twist at the end of The Invaders is the closest we get to those ideas, capping off a brilliant episode.

3. **The Obsolete Man**: I was tempted to just have a three-way tie for first place instead of having episodes in second or third. I didn’t do that, however, because I feel like that would have been a cop-out. Having said that, The Obsolete Man was a serious contender for the top spot thanks to Burgess Meredith and Fritz Weaver. We saw Fritz in Third From the Sun, but he ascended to a whole new level in The Obsolete Man. The Chancellor is a performative showman in front of his audience, but cold and calculating when he’s alone with Wordsworth. That brings me to Burgess Meredith, and this is his best performance of the series so far. It’s a better performance than Time Enough At Last, he’s that damn good. These two masters of their craft have a long power struggle, with both men losing and assuming control throughout the episode. The two sets serve as their arenas, and I can’t decide whether I love the iconic courtroom or the intimate apartment setting more. I don’t even know what to say about the writing, I can only describe it as Rod Serling dancing with the English language. I read somewhere that Rod wrote 48 of the show’s first 65 episodes, which is goddamn insane. He showed signs of burnout throughout Season 2, but he was able to finish the season with a masterpiece of an episode.

2. **Shadow Play**: If The Obsolete Man is elegant in its simplicity, Shadow Play is a brain-bending affair where everything needed to be perfect for the episode to not crash and burn. Needless to say, it works. Philosophy majors will love this episode for its reimagining of Plato’s Cave, but the rest of us will have fun trying to put the pieces together. In the past I’ve critiqued episodes for raising too many questions, but Shadow Play is very deliberate about what the questions it wants to answer. There’s a line between complex andconfusing, and Shadow Play makes all of its moving parts work. I genuinely didn’t know whether or not he was dreaming, and I still have fun thinking about what’s real and what isn’t. In order for this episode to work I needed to buy into its premise, which was easy thanks to Dennis Weaver’s performance as Adam Grant. I didn’t know whether or not to believe the mad bastard, but he was just that engaging. This is what happens when a show takes a huge risk and commits to its execution, and the first thing I wanted to do after finishing Shadow Play was watch it again. It was almost number one, but I think you know what’s gonna take the top spot.

1. **Eye of the Beholder**: You’ll never forget the first time you watch Eye of the Beholder. It is by far the best twist in the franchise. Since we don’t see any faces for the first 20 minutes, the episode has to communicate through dialogue and body language. Hiding the faces took creative lighting, blocking, and cinematography, and I can forgive the very few moments where a face appears through the shadows because the overall effort was a technical masterpiece. The writing speaks for itself, I think my favorite scene was the “state isn’t God” conversation. The twist is so mind blowing that you might miss the Leader’s conformity speech, which is hauntingly relevant to this day. This episode is outstanding in every element that I could talk about, and that’s why it’s the best episode of Season 2.",OneTrueBrody,Ranking Every Twilight Zone Episode: Season Two!,1558914013,23,True,TwilightZone,2019-05-26
8,"This is just a theory but have you read the details about the season finale of the 2019 twilight zone  called 'Blurryman'   ?  It tells about two writers played by  Seth Rogen and Zazie Beetz who felt as if they are 'noticed by by a mysterious person who is there one minute and isn't there the next minute'.

&amp;#x200B;

But when I look at the sneak peek of Blurryman episode, it has the narration lines in Seth Rogen's characters's computer  along with the line '*She is about to learn*' from a paper  where they resemble the standard twilight zone opening and closing narration lines of every episode  especially when  Zazie Beetz's characters tries to make her friend notice her along with the reference from 'Time enough at last'  and the door from the twilight zone opening sequence is now in the episode itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I believe to quote John Cleese from Monty Python '*And now for something completely different*' that the season finale of twilight zone might try something different as it  involves Jordan Peele's narrator role  is involved in this season finale whom the protagonists of the episode must haven nicknamed him 'Blurryman' as   Zazie Beetz's character must have entered his area when she entered the twilight zone's door which explains why her friend doesn't see her and how she end up in an apocalyptic landscape, Especially that it involves the blurry line between fantasy and reality as the protagonists  are frightened if they  are real or fiction and that this season finale  is likely a loose remake of the original twilight zone's  first season finale called ""A World of His Own"" Where Rod serling's narrator role is also involved in this episode at the end .

11,"The man who ruined society is an idea I had where it all started with a man wanting a date. 

I think it would work better for a Grindr type of story as they allow accounts to be blank and others can log in without being another man or other facts that you find on a dating website.
It would be a guy who went on a dating website and doesn't have much luck. So he starts to share his life, interest and hobbies. Embelling some stories to get more notice. He gets a few likes and offers yet everytime he asks for a pic or a meetup it's a  faliure. So he starts going to the gym, getting a promotion and clothes that are hot. He starts to get attention in real life not knowing that he has a stalker who became obessed with him. They place monitors and hack his phone. At first he wouldn't notice anything strange going on until his embellished stories start to come back to bite him as those stories were their reason they liked him so much. 

How did he ruin society? We'll one day he sees a car parked weirdly and leave in a hurry. Also get hears tapping on his windows and weird notes. Overhearing these details they try to make his life more interesting. Like he's in a movie. What ever event you think makes him more attractive and apply it.

Using future techology they broadcast these events and being said across the sky like an echo. It becomes somewhat of a game after a while where some do fall in love seeing him as a champion of virtue and others as a Sims like game where they torment him. After awhile the truth is lost with others loving him or turning on him with the drop of a hat as the stories change or intermix overtime. Making him into a myth like character.

Finally he's put in witness protection as it's driving him crazy with rapid fans and enemies who never give him a moment's peace. Sitting in a cabin he spends his day in isolation as he hears the voices  everywhere and finds out that no one is safe. The president can't sleep at night, society has grind to a halt as planes crash or vehicles piling up.  Secret passwords and codes are now written in secret as hacking and piracy become the norm. The military cuts the power once aday to kill the air pollution and ordinary citizens are tormented by the echoes. The man can't step outside unless  he risks someone spitting him and alerting the others or tell him to spot as they would target his voice with microphone after microphone hits his direction. His  becomes a curse as it all started as him wanting to a relationship.

Episode 2: The show has a man go on a flight. He hears about his plane crashing but in the end he causes the crash. He realizes his mistake too late. He's killed.

22,"Spoilers obviously. What I'm curious is if blurryman can be seen in the background of all current episodes of this season, as suggested in the episode. It would require going back and combing through each one of them again. The question being then, is this blurryman actually the spirit of Rod Serling ""watching over"" the production of his beloved series? All the weird meta/fourth wall reveal with Jordan Peele breaking character was very odd, as well as the idea that this might have been a self-fulfilling prophecy for a young writer who grew up on so many episodes. Regardless, I thought it was very interesting and a bold choice to close out the season with. I think my personal favorite episode this season is still the Blue Scorpion one because it felt like it could have come out of the original series.

30,"I'm beginning to wonder if the original episode started out as the original Seth Rogan episode they began shooting, and somewhere during production/post-production, they started reading the show's reviews and decided to do a little re-writing.

Peele makes a comment about the monologue being a little too ""on the nose"" and preachy.  I doubt they were trying to include preachy/heavy-handed writing in previous episodes just to set up this line, and I find it hard to believe that he's addressing just the one line they were talking about.

The writer then begins to explain herself and her 'responsibility' as a writer (IMO, your only responsibility as an artist is to yourself, and if others want to support your art after seeing what you've done for yourself, so be it.  But that's just an OPINION, and I don't feel like the character's opinion took away from the story at all.  It made it stronger.)  I feel like there were a couple lines like this (especially during the chase scene while she meta-discussed the episode she was in).  I think this was the writers' attempting to explain their logic, and if so, I believe it was done softly and very well.  I also think they threw in the trope-filled chase scene (complete with twisted ankle, crying, convincing herself it's all just sleep deprivation, jump scares, etc) to address the main character's distaste for cheap thrillers and to bore the audience by showing them how cheap the thrills could have been.

For those who don't know, Blurryman is commonly used as a representation of the faceless masses/critics.  There's a chance that Blurryman started out as a ghoul, the angry ghost of Serling, but ended up being a way to address the angry, faceless critics who were coming after the writers.  Something doesn't feel right when imagining the writers sitting around writing a blurry character terrorizing a person mercilessly then just randomly showing their face and holding their hand and calling it their best way to honor Serling.  Fuck, but then again, they've been building up to it with Blurryman cameos for a whole season, so it might just be that thinly written.  I just felt like all those scenes during the chase were made for something else.  It doesn't feel like they wrote all that just to have the blurry character come out of the shadows and say ""Surprise motherfucker!  It's your idol, I've just been messing with you because I'm so well revered as a people's person and decided to become a murderous demon to help you out.""

The ending, the discussion about closing your eyes to the things you think aren't important/childish... I feel like this was the staff addressing their lack of 'monster of the week', 'sci-fi', and 'campfire stories' episodes.  A lot of the comments here seem to think that this was insulting the viewer and telling them that they SHOULD close their eyes to the childish things and focus on the important stuff (the message), but I heard the line as the exact opposite.  I felt like the Serling lines were pointing out (to the writer) that if you close your eyes off to the things that you think aren't important, you lose the greater meaning of the message, and that she shouldn't JUST focus on the message or she's only seeing half the picture.

Maybe it's me, but I felt like the staff heard the responses to the show, scrambled to do a re-write (I think Peele even pokes fun at himself and the need for a last-second rewrite in this episode in some meta meta), used it as an opportunity to address the audience, and have Serling ""himself"" explain to the writers what the audience felt, then usher her on to Season 2 where she can take those messages with her and use it to write episodes that don't forget about the ""childish"" things that made the original series so well balanced and entertaining.

**I hope.  God, I hope.**

Also, not a huge fan of the CGI, but they didn't TOTALLY butcher it.  When his head turned, the nose/mouth looked completely off and they probably could've used a few seconds less on his face so we wouldn't notice, but the voice-actor that played Serling did a great job.  There was a part where it sounded like they cut and paste old sound bites with terrible pacing and different inflections on mid-sentence words so they could use his original voice in newly written lines.  Not so great.

But still, if anything, this episodes makes me hopeful.  If I'm right about the re-write, I'm incredibly optimistic about Season 2, seeing how well they addressed the audience's criticism in this episode.  Assuming that's what they did.  Otherwise, it would be an anticipated defense to writing they weren't confident would sell to the audience and an excuse to use the finale to tell the audience why they wrote the series the way they did / give themselves a little stroke and smoke before the finale party.

31,"I thought I liked Blurryman from the feelings it gave me. I felt fear and confusion with the twists and turns, and unlike many episodes this season, I felt like I was truly transported to the Twilight Zone. That being said, the ending with CGI Rod Serling felt very problematic to me. They used a mock Serling to self-congratulate, letting everyone know how they were staying true to the original show and giving themselves his blessing from beyond the grave. Whether or not you think this show does justice to the original, having fake Rod come out and give a speech about imagination at the end of the episode was, to me, a terrible move to make. It seems like a decision made to quell criticism and incite nostalgia, and I think that's a cheap way to try to get more respect. Let your work speak for itself and prove to the audience that it's deserving of the Twilight Zone title. Whatever Rod may have thought of this new iteration, none of us will know, and for the showrunners (who have lots to gain by Rod's blessing) to artificially give themselves that honor is low.

38,"I've been a fan of Mark Silverman's work for sometime now, and without giving anything away, it was great to see him associated with the show again.   Going back to 1994,   Silverman did the voice work of Serling (and was originally supposed to be his stand-in impersonator visible on ""screen"" for the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.   In fact photos exist of Silverman in makeup before the idea was scrapped in favor of using original footage of Serling (it's a good life), and changing the ending to just be vocally-based.   He was even chosen/recommended personally for the role, by Carol (Carolyn) Serling, Rod Serling's widow (who's name appears in the opening credits).  

&amp;#x200B;

In 2004, Silverman reprised his role as the voice of Serling, recording the content for the Tower of Terror in Disney's California Adventure (now Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout).    This audio can also be heard at the Tower of Terror in Disney Studios Paris.

&amp;#x200B;

In light of the above, I had come to own the individual audio tracks, voicework, and effects, narration, and ride elements for both the Florida and California Tower attractions some were in better shape than others so some processing and mixing were in order.  So in doing so and having a tad bit of hobbyist audio background,     I created complete  ride-throughs for both Towers.   Both took several weeks of tweaking, and for the Florida one, I used the audio for drop sequence 1 (there are 4 separate drop sequence audio tracks in all).      The left / right mixing for the preshows were very much intentional depending on the placement of the mono TV in the library.    Both were assembled from over 60 different tracks each.   The ending song for DCA was also very much intentional, as I had created that track the week the Tower of Terror closed.

2,"They're both crap save for the second one, and they explore similar concepts.

""The Warrior"": A depressed man wakes up one day to find that a lot of humanity has been wiped out by bizarre, borderline eldritch creatures. However, instead of holing up with the rest of the survivors in a military grade bunker, he embarks on a one-man rampage to get to said bunker, simply because he ""Wants to do the right thing"". But with each battle, he gets more brutal, more ruthless, and more effective at wholesale obliterating the monsters. By the end of the story, the beings are LITERALLY BEGGING him to stop, even resurrecting a ton of people and rebuilding entire cities with their technology to make up for their (Frankly horrific) atrocities against humanity. But no matter what they do, he doesn't stop. He just keeps killing. Eventually, (even with human society rebuilt, so there's room for hope) he stands in the aftermath of a psychotic orgy of violence, as he tells people ""I did it! I stopped them!"" 


Then people start to back away in fear from him.


We get that classic jingle as he shouts at people not to leave him. 


""When our instincts are forced into action, are we really better than the things we use them against?""﻿

The next episode:

""Truth"": We follow a guy who lives in a world with monsters in it. Said monsters kill people whenever they feel like it, are complete assholes, and are just kind of... Yeah. However, everyone treats them normally, as if they're human beings. Our protagonist, however, sees the truth, and people call him an ""Oppressor"" for trying to stop the monsters.

5,"I was really excited about The Twilight Zone coming back especially with Jordan Peele being involved, but god damn has this incarnation been very disappointing. 

Point of Origin has to be least favorite episode so far other than Not All Men. I don't have any issue with the show addressing social/political issues, but their approach to this feels so forced and shallow. I don't come away from any of these episodes feeling introspective, intrigued, or truly satisfied by the writing. I'm in my early 20s but I did watch reruns of the original Twilight Zone as a kid and absolutely loved it. Almost every episode left me sitting their analyzing and thinking about what I watched. It was one of the great joys of viewing the show, and as I got older and rewatched the same episodes I enjoyed them even more. Also shoutout to mom who would got me into watching the show back in the day. It was her favorite. 

It's still better TV than a lot of shows out there right now, but I can't help but feel like CBS drop the ball with this. From what it looks like, Peele isn't even that involved. He is a producer, the narrator, and co-wrote one episode (Nightmare at 30,000 ft), but hasn't directed any of the episodes. I don't know the inner workings of the show, so I could be wrong, but I feel like if Peele had more control the quality would be so much higher. Get Out and Us had real nuance to them, and I never felt like the message was being slammed in my face. If the series gets renewed I hope they listen to some of the criticisms because I still feel like The Twilight Zone has so much potential.  

Yeah, just a bit of a rant. Six Degrees of Freedom is probably the only episode I sort of enjoyed. One positive thing I'll say is that the acting has been really good in all of the episodes. This show so far has just been like a Soundcloud rapper version of Black Mirror, the AliExpress Black Mirror, or like the Black Mirror version of those weird knock off cereals you can buy from Aldi.

&amp;#x200B;

Often in these stories where a character gains a supernatural power they abuse it, lose it, and occasionally learn from it.  The Twilight Zone is smart enough not to get bogged down by one story archetype so it constructs a spectrum of characters as recipients of these powers.  Sometimes it's a nasty couple who instantly turn to gaming a racetrack and sometimes it's a poor couple who get carried away.  The types of characters that receives this power and their reactions to it is the crux of the story that supports the inevitable twist.  A more cruel version of this story would have Hector immediately acknowledge his telepathy and use it to manipulate others only to end with everyone being able to read his thoughts.  Not to say that story couldn't be enjoyable, but it would get old pretty fast.  Those rumors floating around that this show's head is up its own zone would be substantiated.  Hector prides himself on his attention to duty and hasn't missed a day of work.  He works hard but people don't think much of him.  Thus, his newfound powers serve not to punish him but to assist him on his journey in becoming more assertive.  Hector B. Poole - human coin - is about to be spit out by a one-armed bandit and chucked back into the hectic stock market... TZ is up 0.25%.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be upfront - this is a comedic episode.  Now I know what you're thinking - a comedic episode?  In *my* Twilight Zone?  But I wanted a mordant look into the human condition!  Yes, the Twilight Zone has its fair share of comedic episodes that have generally been maligned and forgotten by the public.  I tend to like these comedic episodes more than your average person.  As an anthology series versatility can only benefit the series as a whole even if they produce weaker individual components.  It's easy to think of the Twilight Zone as this monolith of spooks, twists, and sci-fi stuff and forget how cheesy, whimsical, and warm it can be.  The Twilight Zone was always a look into the imagination, the human spirit that cannot be shackled to a single tone.

Dick York really shines here.  I like him better here than in *The Purple Testament* and I'm not surprised he settled into a more comedic role.  Though that line about mind-reading is a lot funnier in hindsight.  I particularly liked the joke about the empty-headed rich girl - easy joke, but Dick really sells it.  Also the prompt *""I'm fired.""* without even having to read Bagby's mind.  There's also a fun moment where he presses his nose against the glass and quickly wipes it.  Schlocky, but charming.  Also I tend not to be critical of acting because it's not my field but I wasn't a fan of Dan Tobin here and Cyril Delevanti was weirdly melodramatic.  June Dayton did okay.  The nature of this concept forces long stretches of time with characters doing mundane tasks with blank expressions which doesn't give them a lot to work with.  There's humor in how the lines were recorded separately and dubbed over, some unintentional.  If nothing else, it serves to highlight how divorced one's mask - one's outer demeanor and appearance can be from their innermost thoughts.

I don't like how Serling frames Hector as a ""human coin.""  The idea of a coin landing on its side causing something supernatural isn't the worst idea but it doesn't really tie in thematically with anything.  Apparently in an earlier draft the car accident gave Hector his powers so it feels rather arbitrary.  It's not like Hector's particularly duplicitous or indecisive in a Harvey Dent-esque manner.  The closest thematic use of the coin's duality goes with the whole thought/behavior dichotomy which isn't terribly insightful and is mostly used for jokes.  Also, coin - bank.  Great.  I suppose the one advantage of this impetus is that it's impermanent.  This episode waves over how telepathy is a curse in disguise with a brief bit of dialogue on how Hectors ears are ringing.  We don't exactly know how these powers work.  When Hector is eavesdropping on Mr. Smithers he slinks closer, as if it's easier to hear him.  Very strange.  It's not a huge deal since this episode focuses more on Hector's character growth over the supernatural power which was a good choice overall.  I might've liked it more if there were more jabs around the people who funnel into the banking institution - maybe we even could've had a swell character moment where Hector generously gives out a loan to a struggling mother and works extra hard or something to make up for that.  The first act certainly could've been more ergonomic.

So how about that character arc?  It's pretty decent, I guess.  You get the impression Hector's the sort who thinks the best of people and realizing their true intentions spurs him to be less forgiving.  Helen's role is somewhat thankless as she's basically the guiding light that tells Hector what to do.  Granted he needs someone to confide in though you really have to wonder what their relationship was like before the episode.  Despite this, Hector at least has the agency to give Mr. Brant the ol' water-to-the-face and give Smithers a well-earned vacation - the conviction's already there.  Also they probably get married at the end, like in your standard comedy.  Penny for your thoughts, nickel for a kiss, and all that.  Later down the line she'll reveal her own magical powers and hijinks will ensue.  Smithers also serves as a cautionary tale in what spinelessness and passivity can do to someone - stuck in a mind-numbing job for decades.  A lot of the dialogue is pretty transparent - I'm a big champion of show don't tell but I get that it comes with the territory.  Smithers' candidness also works as a counterbalance to how deceptive most everyone is.

So basically, Hector learns about the evils that lurk within the hearts of men.  We get adultery, fraud, and standard villainy.  But in the end, Hector ends up blackmailing Mr. Bagby to get a promotion.  Are we supposed to see Hector's actions as good and just?  This is another problem with the way information is conveyed - we never really see Hector work hard or demonstrate kindness.  Helen just tells us this and she's crushing on him.  *I think she's a little biased.*  Giving everyone else villainous thoughts and getting us to feel bad for Hector doesn't cut it.  You could read this episode very cynically - the society we've constructed is rife with corruption and the only way to get ahead is to be equally corrupt.  This episode presupposes that Hector is a good person and will use his newfound confidence virtuously but that's not good enough.  And even if this were the case - would it be justified?  The Twilight Zone's morality is generally warped in a questionably simplistic way - if you're a good person, good things will happen and vice versa.  The ends often justify the means.  The stories the Twilight Zone tells are wrapped in allegory and parable so you can choose to take away basic messages - working hard, showing kindness, and being confident are virtues.  I don't think this harsh take was Johnson's intention but it just hangs there, like a thin layer of gum coating a shiny penny.  Normally I'm all for darker subtext behind lighthearted episodes but this feels like an oversight.  It doesn't ruin the episode or anything - just food for pennies.  And I know you're probably going ""wow, way to totally nitpick this goofy comedy episode.""  If there's one thing that unites the comedic and dramatic episodes it's the show's moral compass.  Many episodes are contingent on it.  And that's worthy of discussion, I think.

This episode also marks the first appearance of the goofy goggles (in these reviews).  The goofy goggles are a pair of comically oversized glasses that show up a few times throughout the series.  They aren't always the exact same prop - they're spooky like that.  Hector seems to be near-sighted and the glasses are mostly used to show his confusion as everybody around him is suddenly an expert ventriloquist.  They also break after the car accident,gaining some sympathy points for Hector.

A woman near the beginning has a strange thought.  *""If Liz and Eddie split up, then Liz can marry Rock and Eddie can marry Tuesday.  Uh-huh.""*  What?  Are we doing *Wordplay* again?

&amp;#x200B;

This is George Clayton Johnson's first teleplay for this series.  No middleman.  I generally enjoy his writing - he gives the Twilight Zone a unique energy.  I feel his greatest strength is latching onto a certain emotion and creating a story that captures it perfectly.  I suppose in this case that emotion is the humor in the thought/behavior dichotomy.  This is a solid script overall but it's somewhat muddled and the pacing and exposition leave something to be desired.  Granted, some of the cynicism is intentional and inherent in a concept like this and it was wise to take on this concept in a more comedic direction.  In a way, comedic episodes can get away with more by appealing to pathos - we feel bad for Hector, so when he gets his promotion and gets the girl we're left with a sense of catharsis regardless of how we got there.  Giving Smithers his trip to Bermuda was sweet.  And don't get me wrong - it *is* pretty funny, even if it relies on the lead actor.  I mean, a lot of episodes are like that.  So as a lighter addition to the Twilight Zone it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Heads, tails - it's on its side.  Spin it around, and you can see everything clearly.

36,"I recently took on the Herculean task of ranking every single episode of The Twilight Zone, and so far I’ve made it through Season 2. For now, my plan is to share my rankings for every season individually, and when I’m finally done I can reveal my overall list with all 156 episodes!

Season 1 is a really strong season. There were so many iconic episodes that I was excited to watch for the first time, and I found a lot of hidden gems. Even the episodes I didn’t think were top 10 material were good, and as a whole I think this season set a high bar for the rest of the series. Having said that, the few episodes that I’d consider bad were REALLY bad, and you’ll find out why in just a moment. I wanted to make this list as objective as possible, so I didn’t just put my favorite episodes at the top just because they’re my favorites. Even then, this list is still just my own personal opinion, and my idea of a good episode will probably be different than yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy this list for what it is, let me know what you think in the comments!

36. **The Mighty Casey**: Well something had to be at the bottom, and I’m actually disappointed with how much this episode sucked. I love baseball, and I usually love baseball-inspired media, but watching this episode felt like watching your favorite team getting blown out by their biggest rival. I can forgive the cheesy sound effects for Casey’s pitches because it’s still an episode from the 1960’s, but the idea of a robot needing a heart in order to play baseball is a stretch. That same heart causing the robot to lose its competitive drive is actively frustrating. There’s not one element of this episode that I’d consider good. If you want something that feels like the Twilight Zone’s take on baseball, just watch Field of Dreams.

35. **The Chaser**: This show is 60 years old, and values have changed a lot since then (William Shatner saying his girlfriend is treating him “like a retarded child” in Nick of Time hasn’t aged well), but this is genuinely uncomfortable to watch. When I look at Roger, all I can see is a creepy incel who date rapes a woman and robs her of her humanity. I don’t sympathize with this piece of shit, and the twist makes me feel horrible for Leela. I do like the inclusion of A. Daemon (get it), and if he was the protagonist then maybe I could get behind this episode. The only reason it isn’t at the bottom is because it’s actually somewhat well-written, at least structurally. Still, this is the only episode that I wanted to turn off halfway through, and that’s unforgivable.

34. **Elegy**: Elegy feels more like a parody of The Twilight Zone than an actual episode. I don’t expect special effects from sixty years ago to age perfectly, but if the premise relies on our (bland and indistinguishable) astronauts seeing people frozen in time, maybe don’t include the shots where people are obviously blinking and twitching. I don’t like how the final scene is basically a monologue explaining everything, it’s such a lazy way to deliver information. It’s an incompetent episode, but it’s almost so bad it’s good. That’s not enough to put it higher on the list, but here we are.

33. **A Nice Place to Visit**: The idea of your own personal Heaven actually be Hell is interesting, but it’s a premise that is tricky to maintain for a full episode. You have to balance the pleasure with the dissatisfaction that comes with getting everything you’ve ever wanted, and this episode botched the execution. It’s implied that Pip is able to control things such as the odds of Rocky winning at the casino and the risk of getting caught robbing a bank. If you’re able to ask for conditions like this, even a semi-confident buffoon could make this Hell work for them. There was some fun to be had, but that revelation took the sting out of the entire episode.

32. **The Fever**: Was this supposed to be scary? There’s a scene where Franklin is talking about the slot machine as if it was an entity out for his soul, and the scene has an intense air to it. Then we see the walking, talking slot machine and it’s just too ridiculous to be scary. The rest of the episode is nothing special, and Franklin goes from being anti-gambling to being stark raving mad way too quickly.

31. **Mirror Image**: This is the first entry that I think people will disagree with me on, because it seems like everybody likes this episode except for me. The performances receive a lot of praise, and it’s honestly not undeserved. Thing is, nearly every episode is well acted, and the acting in Mirror Image doesn’t elevate the rest of the episode like Jack Klugman’s performance in A Passage for Trumpet (but I’m getting ahead of myself). Besides the acting, I don’t get the appeal of this episode. Doppelgängers are creepy, but the story begins and ends at “a woman sees her clone twice”. The characters aren’t fleshed out enough for me to care about them, so I can’t empathize with Millicent’s fear or Paul’s concern. The ending is also more confusing than anything; ambiguous endings can work really well, but this one raises a lot of questions that I quite frankly don’t care to find answers to.

30. **A World of Difference**: I really wanted to like A World of Difference, partly because it’s another decently popular episode, but mostly because of how much I love The Truman Show. This episode just made me want to watch The Truman Show, because any good thing I could say about it was done much better in that movie and many others with a similar premise. The body of the episode doesn’t work for me because Gerry isn’t developed beyond “alcoholic with a bitch wife”, and the role he loses himself into is barely defined at all (credit where it’s due, that last point is actually explored in the episode). Also, the ending rips off Sixteen Millimeter Shrine.

29. **Mr. Bevis**: I’ve been negative so far, but this is the last episode on the list that I’d consider “bad”, and even then I don’t dislike Mr. Bevis. The problem with this episode is how saccharine it is. It feels like how It’s a Wonderful Life would look if George Bailey was only mildly annoyed with his life. Henry Bevis never wanted to change everything about himself, he just had one crummy day that he’d like to fix. At times it’s a charming love letter to the world’s goobers, but too often it feels like the pilot for a show called Leave it to Bevis.

28. **A World of His Own**: “A writer whose creations come to life” is a great idea with a lot of creative directions to go in. Unfortunately, we only get to see Greg create Mary and an elephant, and later destroy his wife. The writing is solid enough, and I was never bored watching this episode, but it could have gone so much further with its premise. I do love Rod’s cameo at the end, it’s hard to believe that this was the first time we actually saw his face.

27. **What You Need**: By now you’re probably sensing a theme with my rankings: I hate seeing great premises ruined by weak executions. What You Need is that concept defined. The opening scene with the peddler in the bar is great, the middle where Fred tries to partner up with him doesn’t go anywhere, and the ending where Pedott says he had to kill Fred because he would have killed him otherwise doesn’t make any sense. If this guy could predict the future, why would he give Fred the scissors or the pen in the first place? I had so many questions coming out of this episode that I felt like I was being too nitpicky, and I hate feeling that way when I’m talking about a show I otherwise adore.

26. **Execution**: Great premise, weird execution (get it). The first act is amazing, there’s very little I would have done differently. The second half goes completely off the rails, with our favorite outlaw going all Encino Man when he ventures into modern society. The ending was completely out of place, did the burglar need to exist at all? As much of a mess as it is, this was actually a really fun episode to watch, I just couldn’t justify putting it any higher on this list. It’s hardly the best episode, but it’s the type of episode that I’ll return to whenever I’m in the right mood for it.

25. **Escape Clause**: I don’t really care for “deal with the devil” stories because of how predictable they are. Escape Clause is about as standard as they come. It’s so standard that I’m actually having trouble coming up with anything to say about it. It’s competent, but not all that creative. There are worse episodes, but at least The Mighty Casey and A Nice Place to Visit gave me something to talk about. I don’t even hate it, but I also don’t like it. As Twilight Zone episode’s go, it’s room temperature tap water.

24. **Third From the Sun**: The Twilight Zone has a knack for social commentary that is still relevant after 60 years. Third From the Sun has lost some of its impact now that we’re not trying to blow each other to kingdom come, but it’s still an effective episode. The episode does a good job at creating tension and a sense of urgency, and the acting was pretty good. What brings the episode down, however, is the random old man trying to stop our protagonists from escaping. I get that the episode needed a villain, but it had to be this guy? I know nothing about his character, and quite frankly I don’t care enough about him for his inclusion to have any effect on me. The message was probably more effective in 1959, but it’s pretty good for a “time capsule” so to speak.

23. **Mr. Denton on Doomsday**: This is one of those episodes that grew on me the more I thought about it. I didn’t like it at first because it does kind of beat you over the head with its message (“the night Fate stepped in” anyone?). But I kept thinking about it, and the twist is genuinely one of the more heartwarming ones. I love how giving Denton his life back means never letting the other kid go down the same road he did. It’s one of the better Western episodes of the first two seasons, all things considered.

22. **The Last Flight**: This would have been a great episode if the story wasn’t entirely delivered through dialogue. The story of a pilot traveling through time in order to rectify his cowardice is excellent on its own, but I would have rather seen his deeds in action rather than hear about them in the past tense. I’m a firm believer of “show don’t tell”, and this episode tells us a lot more than it shows. I do enjoy this episode for its story and message, but it deserved a better execution.

21. **Big Tall Wish**: Let me get something out of the way; the scene where Bolie is talking to the promoter is entirely worthless, takes up way too much screentime, and drags the episode down. Everything else about The Big Tall Wish is amazing. Bolie Jackson is such a great underdog, and Henry is the perfect wide-eyed child. The cinematography when Henry makes his wish is so clever yet so simple. Bolie telling Henry to stop believing (Bolie-ving?) in wishes and missing out on his second chance is genuinely heartbreaking. It’s a shame that so much time is dedicated to one meaningless scene, because a simple rewrite would have brought this episode into Top 10 territory. I’m just spitballing here, but imagine replacing that one scene with a few short scenes of Bolie winning fights thanks to Henry’s wishes. That would have made the ending that much more powerful.

20. **The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine**: We’ve reached the point where I get to start talking about the episodes I really love. If I was ranking this solely on how much I liked the episode, this would be in the top ten. This is one of those episodes that might not be as memorable if it wasn’t for the acting, so it’s a good thing that every actor is at the top of their game, especially Ida Lupino as Barbie. The Twilight Zone loves nostalgia, and this episode is a character study of a woman who loses herself to her pursuit of the past. After Barbie gets chewed out by the director, even I started to sympathize with her desire to go back in time. I’ve been told that this is really similar to Sunset Boulevard (which I haven’t seen), but on its own it’s definitely an episode worth watching, even though I wouldn’t call it one of the “elite” episodes.

19. **The Four of Us Are Dying**: Again, this an episode that I enjoy a lot more than my ranking suggests. A man who can change his face at will is an awesome concept, and the story we got explores that concept really well. I love the visual presentation of this episode, from the noir aesthetic to the clever ways they’d hide the moments where the actors switch out. The only reason it isn’t higher is because the episode ends just as it starts getting interesting. It’s one of the few episodes that I think would have benefited from Season 4’s extended run time. I love the episode we got, I just wanted more.

18. **People are Alike All Over**: Honestly? This is a good episode that I don’t have a lot to say about. I take notes after finishing each episode, and after I watched this one I had a lot of trouble finding anything to write. I did enjoy it, the twist is awesome, and I loved the one line “let me know what I’m dying for”, but honestly a lot of the episode just felt like filler. The only scene I can remember in any sort of detail was the ending. There was that one Martian woman who feels bad about putting our hero in captivity, and if she was more developed it could have been great. It’s one of those episodes I feel like I’ll need to rewatch when I go ahead and make my overall list.

17. **A Stop at Willoughby**: I don’t think there’s a single fan of the show who dislikes this episode, myself included. It was actually a personal favorite of Rod Serling himself. It’s a really solid episode that does so many things right, but it doesn’t do any one thing better than other Twilight Zone episodes. Walking Distance is better at romanticizing nostalgia, Time Enough at Last has a better portrayal of a man who wants to escape from the world, and I could go on but I don’t want to seem like I’m piling on this episode because I do really like it.  James Daly gave a great performance, and the final shot is one hell of an ending. It’s a solid 8 in a season that gave us a lot of 9s and 10s, which just goes to show how strong the competition was.

16. **Perchance to Dream**: Perchance to Dream has some of the slickest cinematography of the entire season. I actually like the aesthetic of the real world a lot more than the dream sequences, but the latter scenes still look incredible. I’m not the biggest fan of the story, but Richard Conte’s performance allowed me to buy into everything that was going on. “It was all just a dream” endings are almost always lame to me, but it worked here better than it has in other shows/movies I’ve seen.

15. **One for the Angels**: Admit it, you smiled when Mr. Death told Lou “you made it”. The ending is so sweet and iconic that you start to forget just how tight the writing is for the rest of the episode. Ed Wynn and Murray Hamilton have outstanding chemistry, making Death seem more like a friend than something to be feared. It’s only the second episode, which makes it even more remarkable considering how well-rounded it is.

14. **The Lonely**: The Lonely is another episode that could have been perfect with a longer running time, but I still love this episode as it is. The concept is pure 1950’s futurism, and the setup before Alicia’s introduction was outstanding. The final act was also incredibly well done, I could feel Corry’s connection to Alicia and the dilemma he found himself in. I just wish their relationship was more developed, which is exactly why The Lonely deserved a longer runtime (or at least made better use of the time it had). It was a great episode that I highly recommend, but it wasn’t as strong as the thirteen episodes ahead of it on this list.

13. **The Hitch-Hiker**: Not gonna lie, I enjoyed this episode a lot more when I watched it for the first time a few years ago. Is it a great episode? Of course, it’s rightfully one of the most iconic episodes of the original series. Nan’s performance is outstanding, and it’s an incredibly well told thriller that puts modern horror movies to shame. It’s one of the greats, but is it the best of the best? The twist is shocking, but to me a great twist should make you reconsider the episode you just watched and see it in a whole new light. Besides some clever foreshadowing I missed the first time around (you’re on the side of the angels), the knowledge that she’s already dead doesn’t really change anything. A lot (and I mean a LOT) of people consider this to be one of the best episodes of the entire series, but personally I think it’s just a great episode in a series full of great episode.

12. **Long Live Walter Jameson**: The majority of the episode is two men having a conversation, and it is a hell of a lot more engaging than that sounds. The meaning of life and the purpose of death are discussed as one and the same, and if that was the only thing this episode had to offer I’d still enjoy it. Naturally, because it’s The Twilight Zone, there’s more. Remember how I gave Elegy a lot of flack for the visuals not aging well? Long Live Walter Jameson’s final scene, in which Walter ages rapidly in real time, is still as mind blowing today as it was 60 years ago. Read up on how they pulled off the effect yourself, it’s something that could have only worked in the days before color TV and CGI.

11. **The After Hours**: The Twilight Zone has a reputation for being a scary show, and while it has many horror elements I wouldn’t call it “horror” in the traditional sense. Having said that, the second half of The After Hours is a shining example of what horror should look like. Watching Marcia walk through the empty mall in complete silence is one of the tensest scenes in the entire show, and the shot of all the mannequins stepping out of the shadows is still my favorite visual of the entire series. The first act probably isn’t the most interesting way to set up the second act, but the rest of the episode speaks for itself. I could talk about the additional little moments that make this episode unique all day, but you should really watch this for yourself to get the full experience.

10. **Nightmare as a Child**: The most “Hitchcockian” episode is what kicks off our top ten. Specifically, the tension and pacing of this episode reminds me of Rear Window, which is my personal favorite Hitchcock movie. Helen and Marky carry the episode really well, Helen’s performance especially is one of the best in the series. It’s one of those episodes that you can either take literally, see it as a coping mechanism born in Helen’s mind, or really anything you want. It’s one of the scarier episodes, and in fact it has one of the most well-executed jump scares I’ve ever seen. Modern horror movies should take some notes from this episode, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star has never been scarier.

9. **The Purple Testament**: This episode is quietly brilliant. The premise speaks for itself, but the episode’s strength lies in the emotional weight of nearly every scene. Moments like Riker leaving photos of his family behind, Fitz saying goodbye to Smitty, and Fitz silently walking amongst his soldiers knowing which of them were going to get it are simply amazing. You really get a sense of Fitz’s burden, which of course is a metaphor for the impossible decisions that real officers are tasked to make. I genuinely want to know how military veterans feel about this episode, I’d love their feedback!

8. **Where Is Everybody**: Where is Everybody does an outstanding job of setting the tone for the rest of the series. Earl Holliman was tasked with carrying 90% of the episode, and he takes us on a roller coaster of uncertainty. The ending is a time capsule of the hopes, concerns, and imagination of Americans at the dawn of the Space Age, and it’s even more powerful knowing that we’d reach the moon just ten years after this episode premiered.

7. **Judgement Night**: This is what justice looks like in The Twilight Zone. The truth behind Lanser’s situation is revealed in bits and pieces, allowing the viewer to connect the dots until the final reveal. Unlike A Nice Place to Visit, this version of hell is a terrifying fate. The attack on The Queen of Glasgow is jaw-dropping in every sense of the word, it’s among my favorite scenes in the series. It may seem like I don’t have a lot to say, but it’s really the type of episode where you can’t be told too much going into it, and I’d hate to ruin the experience of someone who hasn’t seen it.

6. **And When the Sky Was Opened**: The first men to venture into space weren’t supposed to come back. That’s a bone-chilling premise, and the fact that we never find out why the astronauts are disappearing makes it even more frightening. Their fate is preordained, and they are powerless to stop it. This episode aired 16 months before Yuri Gagarin became the first man to venture into the final frontier, so what we have here is an episode capitalizing on our fear of the unknown. Obviously Rod Taylor gets a lot of love since he’s effectively the central character, but Jim Hutton and Charles Aidman deserve equal praise. This episode will leave you with a lot of questions, but the fact that it deliberately doesn’t have many answers is what makes it great.

5. **Time Enough At Last**: This episode has a reputation that precedes itself, and how could it not? The ending, the punchline to The Twilight Zone’s cruelest joke, is one of the most legendary in television history. Ending aside, it’s still a great episode. Burgess Meredith needs no introduction, his performance is all but unmatched. The setting is a desolate wasteland which serves as a metaphor for Bemis’ loneliness , and the set design is an underrated part of the whole experience. If you take the ending out you’d still have a great episode, but the ending is what helped this episode remain so iconic after so many years.

4. **I Shot an Arrow Into the Air**: Remember Elegy? Remember how I said the three astronauts in that episode were completely indistinguishable from each other? The three astronauts in I Shot an Arrow Into the Air have their own goals, motivations, and personalities, which is really important in an episode where character conflict drives the story. In a way, the events in this episode don’t matter as much as the way each character reacts to them, and I love that. Much like And When the Sky Was Opened, the story revolves around the first three men in space; what we have here are two stories told through the same lens that take radically different directions, and I love them both equally. I have no doubts that Serling used this episode for inspiration when he wrote Planet of the Apes, so if you’re a fan of that movie you’re going to love this episode.

3. **Walking Distance**: I’m man enough to admit that I cried during this episode. I’m only 22, but when Martin is telling his younger self to enjoy his youth all I can hear is Rod Serling speaking straight to my soul. I’ve watched countless shows, movies, etc about adults wishing they could be kids again, but Walking Distance is operating on another level. This episode doesn’t romanticize nostalgia, it appreciates its value while also recognizing that pining for your past is no way to spend your present. There’s one scene in particular that best encapsulates this episode, and it’s when Martin tries to introduce himself to his parents using his government issued IDs. It’s such an “adult” way to say that you’re a “child”, and it’s almost too brilliant to put into words. A real-life Martin Sloan would probably have a heart attack knowing how much ice cream sodas cost nowadays, but the themes of this episode are ageless.

2. **A Passage For Trumpet**: All cards on the table, this was the hardest episode for me to rank because it’s my personal favorite Twilight Zone episode. I didn’t want to be “that guy” who overrated his favorite episode just because of how much I love it. I knew that putting it above fan favorites such as Time Enough At Last and The Hitch-Hiker would raise eyebrows, so I had to be damn sure I knew what I was doing having it this high. Having said all that, I genuinely believe that A Passage For Trumpet belongs in the conversation for the best Twilight Zone episode. This episode makes you feel the full emotional spectrum; desperation, optimism, depression, regret, hope, it’s all here. It’s not a complex episode story-wise, but every element was carefully considered and deliberately executed to achieve perfection. Early in the episode we see Joey play his trumpet with what I can only describe as pure passion, and that scene adds so much emotional weight to his decision to sell his trumpet. Moments like that are so easy to perceive but really hard to describe why it works, and yet this episode is full of moments like that. I can’t go on without mentioning Jack Klugman, whose portrayal of Joey Crown is the single greatest performance of the entire season, and maybe even the series. With every expression, every delivery, every upward glance, Klugman brought Joey Crown to life. I could go on all day about this episode, but it’s the kind of episode you need to see in order to appreciate fully. Gene Roddenberry eulogized Rod Serling by saying “No one could know Serling, or view or read his work, without recognizing his deep affection for humanity, his sympathetically enthusiastic curiosity about us, and his determination to enlarge our horizons by giving us a better understanding of ourselves.” In my opinion, there’s not one episode that encapsulates that idea better than A Passage For Trumpet.

1. **The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street**: As you can probably tell, this was a hard list to write. There are 36 episodes in the first season. An overwhelming majority of them are good, plenty are great, and a handful are what I consider to be essential viewing. I constantly adjusted the order in order to make it as objective as humanly possible, but no man is perfect. The only thing that wasn’t in question was the number one episode, because The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street is the one episode that I consider to be genuinely important. It is the gold standard of writing timeless social commentary, because the themes of this episode are still relevant today. By pure coincidence I watched this episode the day before the Mueller Report came out, and I’m genuinely amazed just how much this episode relates to our culture. It’s a brutally honest depiction of how we’ll turn on our fellow man because of fear and prejudice. As I was watching I started to realize just how much I’ve fallen into the traps that this episode was warning about; it’s one thing for an episode to be technically sound or well acted, it’s another thing for an episode to make me reconsider my perspectives. It’s not chilling because some unknown entity will destroy us, but because we’d be the ones destroying ourselves and it’ll be fucking easy. “I didn’t know he was my neighbor”...

41,"Have the people who complain about the new series even watched the old series? I keep hearing ""Jordan's Peele's Twilight Zone is too on the nose! The old one was sO sUbTLe!"" Yet we have closing monologues such as:

""The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices...to be found only in the minds of men. For the record, prejudices can kill...and suspicion can destroy...and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own – for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to the Twilight Zone."" --*The Monsters are Due on Maple Street*

""A sickness known as hate. Not a virus, not a microbe, not a germ—but a sickness nonetheless, highly contagious, deadly in its effects. Don't look for it in the Twilight Zone—look for it in a mirror. Look for it before the light goes out altogether."" --*I Am the Night-Color Me Black*

And my personal favorite, in an episode where HITLER'S FUCKING GHOST is the villain: ""Where will he go next, this phantom from another time, this resurrected ghost of a previous nightmare – Chicago? Los Angeles? Miami, Florida? Vincennes, Indiana? Syracuse, New York? Anyplace, everyplace, where there's hate, where there's prejudice, where there's bigotry. He's alive. He's alive so long as these evils exist. Remember that when he comes to your town. Remember it when you hear his voice speaking out through others.

If you really look back at the OG, there are only a handful of insanely ""classic"" eps, the rest are truly truly some exercises I softballing for CBS' sake.

To compare this new take to anything on Netfllix is an excecise in self-doom.  You pretty much sit and waste time Tring to nitpick and find all flaws in something that is mean to exsist outside of our universe, outside of the walls of your experience.

I used the OG ""kick the can"" in a TEDx talk I presented in 2015 to show that current trends lend us to stop enjoying life and continue to grow old and sour about content we want to enjoy.

We really want to enjoy things but our minds feel the need to present our critique before we can even have a discourse over digestion and letting the dust settle.

Black Mirror is a take on tech changing our lives and if anything this new series drives home the fact that everyone feels they have a voice.

1,"This to me is the new show's biggest problem.  Its whole purpose is to wrap up a blatantly loud message about politics in a creepy sci-fi package.  And what bothers me the most is that they did this intentionally - Jordan Peele's two takes on the horror genre, Get Out and Us (Us isnt as blatant, but it is there), are so involved with race and modern politics that they are actually major parts of the theme itself.

Rod Serling's original vision was to make a show that teaches a lesson to the viewer without them really noticing they were being taught until the very end.  And even then any blatant reference to modern poilitics from that time was slim to none (I imagine there may be a few exceptions, but the point still stands).  

This, however, is a painful inside out take on the Twilight Zone; a subtle sci-fi horror wrapped up for us as a blatant political period piece about whats wrong with the world (particularly America), rather than a subtle message about our society wrapped up as a blatant sci-fi horror show.",jrt_01,I honestly feel like the lessons learned in the new Twilight Zone are about as subtle as a brick to the face.,1557362116,89,True,TwilightZone,2019-05-08

&amp;#x200B;

Like many episodes of 20's Twilight Zone, I really like the ideas this one is playing with.  I don't think any other iteration of the Twilight Zone would have the stones (as in, red space hulkstones) to tell stories like this which puts 20's Twilight Zone in a unique position.  This might be a weird comparison but The Fugitive is a pretty silly episode of 60's Twilight Zone where Jenny's aunt's actions could be interpreted as child abuse.  It's relatively understated and put on the backburner for this wacky space king plot and is mostly used to get the audience to empathize with Jenny, not unlike Rapunzel's cruel upbringing.  And like The Fugitive, Not All Men also has a weird sense of humor and the predilection of juxtaposing serious issues with something fantastic and absurd.  I think this episode would've been stronger if it played the whole hulkstone epidemic thing a little more seriously because half of the time it wants to discuss serious social issues and the other time it's content with being a popcorn thriller.  To this episode's credit I think it's the funniest episode of 20's Twilight Zone yet but it comes at the cost of its message - which if you ask me, is a real shame.  The Fugitive clearly wasn't meant to be this deep dive on the psychological effects of child abuse but both episodes suffer from being just too darn silly for their own good.  While I like this episode better than The Fugitive overall the way that it wants to be taken seriously makes it more muddled, and ultimately - wasted potential.  Almost as wasted as a 15-year-old snorting empty shells of hulkstone in a dumpster behind Eddies.  Eat enough dust and you'll be cryin' out for the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

The sequence where Dylan plays keep-away with the hulkstone is really clever because it not only misdirects the audience into thinking there's something sinister behind the hulkstone but also gets us to question whether it affects both men and women.  It also provides a cute awkward moment between the two that builds us up for when things suddenly stop going so well.  You can see the writers constructing their thesis - what could be read as a cute moment between the two could be seen as Dylan being patronizing.  The way he keeps emphasizing that their love is ""cosmic"" also supports this.  And y'know what?  I like this twist.  This whole ""gotcha, there's no supernatural element and it was mankind's internal darkness all along"" turn is one that I can always get behind.  The thing is, it's not believable.  It's good to have Dylan as a case study.  It's good to namedrop placebos.  But am I really supposed to believe that an ordinary meteor shower is gonna get tons of men to become engorged with forehead veins, red eyes, and go full Mad Max?  Maybe if they downplayed it to a violent bar incident, a stalker, and Mike gets a little too intense.  The theory that the hulkstones are causing the hulks is just a random flimsy suggestion from Annie anyways - maybe if they had a group of women concluding this or some kind of sciencey news program the subversion would have more impact.  This episode wants to roll around in its violent aggro apocalypse but it can't connect back to the present.  When nerdy boss guy postulates that it's a hormonal thing or a chromosomal interaction I'm just sitting here rolling my eyes.  And I get where they're coming from.  Not all men are angry hyper-violent hulks.  Duh.  When you hear incidents of men committing heinous crimes it reflects poorly on all men and each individual ultimately has a choice in who they want to be.  While this episode is a little silly if you take it literally, it's clearly meant to be allegorical, albeit indulgent at times.  This may be one of those ""oops all metaphor"" cases and I totally get why people would be offended.  It's insulting to imply that men are biologically inclined to be these Saturday Morning hulks that have to suppress this inner bloodlust.  Whenever I analyze media I try to give the author the benefit of the doubt so I'll choose to believe that this isn't blatant misandry from the writers' part.  Your guess is as good as mine.

There's a peculiar scene at the beginning that I thought was really neat.  So Annie's boss tells her that she's gonna have to work with Dylan and we cut to this surreal yoga class where Annie is instructed to do a warrior pose.  This could be seen as Annie trying to put on a brave face but I read it as a greater overarching message about how to respond to sexual harassment - one of the opening shots of the episode shows The Art of War which carves some neat subtext into the episode.  The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting - when Martha attempts to use the hulkstone to she-hulk out it doesn't work.  Victims of sexual abuse won't always be able to stop abusers through physical or mental strength alone as that's playing to the power dynamic imposed by the abuser.  While this episode doesn't explicitly propose a solution, Annie's confession to her sister invokes the #MeToo movement and the power of reaching out to others and group support.  That, and a goddamned frying pan to the head.  See what I mean when I say this episode has tonal problems?  I also like that it brought up that men can be victims of sexual abuse too and its prevalence among LGBT relationships.  I wonder if that's why the ship's named Achilles.  These are topics that are often overlooked and I'm glad that they were touched upon here.

A couple of minor nitpicks - Annie wakes up in the morning to see that her left arm is bruised.  If you rewind a little bit you'll see Dylan was clutching to her right arm.  Just an oversight, I think.  Also that brief sequence with the meteoroids zipping around was peak cheese.  Not that that's a deal-breaker, I like how the cheese added to the easygoing atmosphere it had going on.

I probably don't need to say this at this point but the directing and cast were spot-on, as usual.  Really liked the lighting in this one.  Taissa Farmiga does an excellent job at getting the audience to go through what she's feeling and I'd let Ike Barinholtz slice me up like a birthday cake any day.  Not surprised that scene became promotional trailer fodder.

&amp;#x200B;

Not All Men smashes two wildly different tones together with mixed results.  I think it's pretty effective at delivering each of those tones - like if this episode was split into two little (standard-length) episodes they would be some pretty good episodes.  As a whole it's clunky and uneven but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a fun time overall.  Again, the way the twist was set up and executed was half-baked and the more I got through the episode the more I figured the ending would probably be unsatisfying.  Also this is one of their better uses of the TV-MA rating, giving us some gratuitous-ass violence and an intimately spooky cake scene.  It wants to have its spooky cake and eat it too.  I haven't read any reviews but I have a feeling this episode's gonna get a lot of negative press.  At least I get to hang onto those unpopular opinions that I love so much.  Somebody reading this review who didn't like the episode might think I'm being too charitable - and even for episodes I don't like (like The Fugitive - spoilers) I feel it's generally more productive as a reviewer to strive for understanding than just trashing on something.  Trashing on stuff is fun, but it's just empty calories at the end of the day.  It's not gonna get you that fiber and HDL.  Yes, we're still hung up on the cake thing.

So the other reason why I haven't been pumping out weekly reviews for 20's Twilight Zone is that I tend to feel pretty lukewarm towards the series as a whole.  It's always hard to write for things I don't have much of an opinion on and I'm glad that an episode like this exists - it's not perfect, but it got a strong mixed reaction from me.  And I'll take a strong mixed reaction over something unmemorable any day.  Fear before kicker, never been sicker.",nulldrone,The Groan Zone - Not All Men Review,1557462647,8,True,TwilightZone,2019-05-10
21,"This may have been mentioned before, but I have an unusual interpretation of the ending. You know how the protagonist has a gun to his head and says that he will be forgiven? Suicide is a big no-no in most religions, so killing yourself intentionally supposedly damns you to an eternity in Hell. Well, I believe that instead of putting the gun down upon seeing the library, Henry Bemis actually pulled the trigger; his personal Hell was finally having the time to read but being effectively blind.",Pseudoineffectual,Time Enough at Last Theory,1557467151,9,True,TwilightZone,2019-05-10
22,"I see this all the time in this sub and it's really starting go get under my skin. The only episode that's been political is Wunderkind. Replay and Not All Men are not political episodes. I'm black, I drive with my wallet and registration on my dashboard every morning because I'm scared to death that if a cop stops me I might get murdered in cold blood for opening my glove hand compartment or reaching to grab my wallet from my pocket. This isn't some narrative that's been sold to black people by the mainstream media, it'll behoove you to know that we have friends and family that we talk to. This shit isn't made up, my dad came to America in 1983, he got stopped by the police on the same road in Massachusetts for two years. My brother got thrown through the glass part of an oven in college for a noise complaint. I will never call the police because I'm scared to death that if they think I'm the suspect they can do whatever they want they could be halfway to killing me and if I tried to save MYSELF FROM BEING MURDERED they could say I was resisting arrest and kill me anyway. The terror in public is constant because no matter what I do I'll always be black. If someone who is racist,  either explicit or implicitly decides to put on a uniform and stop ""bad guys"" but his head of a bad guy is wearing my face what can I do about that?  Could you imagine if in the 1960's people called aboliting the poll tax, ""talking about politics"" it would sound absurd. I'm not qualified to speak on the episode on toxic masculinity, because I'm not a woman,  but I imagine the reaction is something similar. If a group of people fear for their lives because of de jure and de defacto policies then it's not politics to them it's literally a matter of life and death. So I'll give you some examples of political issues, negotiating the debt ceiling, Departmental bugets, appropriations of funds for ice breaker ships for the artic, healthcare financing, public vs private investment in national infrastructure, enforcement of national borders. Do you have any friends that have died to ODing on drugs? Do you realize how much of an asshole you'd sound like if you called the opioid epidemic and your friends death political issues? I very much enjoy that this show is hitting people over the head with it cause y'all still don't get it.

TL:DR people fearing for their lives isn't a political issue. If you say it's a political issue, I will feel like you're half of a human being and probably a huge asshole.",CaptainIronBoobs,Stop calling human rights issues politics,1557469303,214,True,TwilightZone,2019-05-10

Which was made by Joe Dante on master of horror 

Lot review point it out is kinda similarities

The screwfly solution 

The title refers to the sterile insect technique, a technique of eradicating the population of screwflies by the release of large amounts of sterilized males that would compete with fertile males, thus reducing the native population more with each generation this is done. This story concerns a similar distortion of human sexuality with disastrous resultat 

The story begins with an exchange of letters and news clippings between Alan, a scientist working on parasite eradication in Colombia, and his wife Anne at home in the U.S., concerning an epidemic of organized murder of women by men. Some scientists suspect a biological cause for this sexually selective insanity (selected observations of lab animals indicate that the normal male sexual urges are spiraling out of control, resulting in death), but the murderers feel it is a natural instinct and have constructed elaborate misogynistic rationalizations for it. For example, a new religious movement is spreading along with the murders: the Sons of Adam, who believe that women are evil, that the garden was a paradise before women were introduced, and that God is telling them to get rid of all of the women. When the religion initially arises, prior to the organized murders, little is done to stop the ideology's spread, nor are their actions of evicting women from the areas the men control prevented. Alan realizes that the disease causes male sexual impulses to instead become violent impulses. Alan, a sensitive, kindly man, realizes that he himself is succumbing and tries to resist the impulses, as well as isolate himself from women. While this occurs, his wife and teenaged daughter have a number of mother-daughter conflicts: the daughter, faithful to her father, refuses to believe her mother's warnings about him. She sneaks off to visit her father, and he murders her, killing himself after the horrific realization of his action. Anne flees north, to Canada, since the disease began in the tropical zones and spread outward. After most of the world's women are dead, adult men start murdering boys. In the end, Anne, pursued by an entire society bent on femicide, discovers the source and motivation behind the plague: an alien species is intentionally causing the human race to destroy itself so that the aliens can have Earth for themselves.

But as far as concepts goes, this might be the most terrifying, because of the cosmic horror aspects.  Think about the situation that the three main characters are in.

Picture yourself in that situation, knowing that some unknown all powerful force has marked you for complete erasure from reality and knowing that you can do absolutely nothing to stop it.

13,"Hey, so I just finished watching *The Hitchhiker* and I got say, I'm disappointed. I *wanted* to like it, I really did. But it just wasn't *good*, and I'll explain why:

So, the episode starts off with a young woman getting her car fixed. She's driving all alone on the highway and it's like, we get it, *Twilight Zone*: women can drive. They're independent now. No need to shove this down our throats. 

I managed to get past that, though, but then we spent like the whole episode watching this woman get followed around by some weird stalker guy who can teleport for some reason. (Of course the stalker is white, but whatever.) If he'd just popped up once or twice, that would be one thing, but the episode gets *so fucking repetitive* by having him pop up like a billion times. This episode *easily* could've been cut by at least twenty minutes and nothing would've been lost. 

As if this weren't enough, the woman also gives a monologue about how she's being followed, and it's like ""yeah, show. We know. *We can see* *it*."" Didn't this show used to be subtle? It used to be they could make a point without bashing it all over our heads. Stop spoon-feeding us exposition, writers. We're not idiots, we can figure it out on our own. 

The episode ends with the woman finding out her mother is in the hospital. Turns out her mother had some sort of breakdown after the main woman died in a car crash, but that doesn't make any sense because we've seen her after the car crash, and she was perfectly fine. Then she gets into the car with the stalker, and it's like, what is this show trying to say? The writers seem confused as to what point they're trying to make. 

Again, I really *wanted* to like this episode, but the writing was so sloppy and inconsistent that I couldn't enjoy it. I've had such high hopes for Rod Sterling but unfortunately he seems to be the victim of his own hype.",hithere297,"Reviewing ""The Hitchhiker"" (1960) as if I were a redditor reviewing the reboot",1556824629,39,True,TwilightZone,2019-05-02

16,"I like how the episode played with the idea of individual insanity vs. collective insanity. Peele's narration was a great little starter here.

Insanity it seems, according to the writers, is a battle between the individual's perspective of reality, and the shared perspective of the group, with objective reality lagging somewhere behind. Pearson touches on this concept of personalized reality when discussing the song preferences. The group dismisses this quickly despite its accuracy. Similarly, Pearson's hypothesis that they're being watched, supports his claim, and the group quickly dismisses it despite its accuracy. Was Pearson insane? Objectively not, to the collective he was, to himself he wasn’t. Who gets to own and give the label, the collective or the individual? Is the crew insane? They believe they are on Mars but the Narrator says they shouldn't believe their own eyes.  Is the group consciousness more valuable than the objective reality. 

The objective truth almost takes a backseat to our own perception in the short-term (until it doesn’t, haha). The objective truth was slightly different than his hypothesis, but that almost didn’t matter in the moments which ultimately shaped the group dynamic and decision making. While the objective truth will eventually catch up with us (the invasion), the way we treat each other and our inability to listen to each other can also result in our own undoing (North Korea/US conflict, Pearson/Crew).

As an aside, I particularly liked the idea of how humans nearly destroyed themselves on a planet, sent a ship and leading a few humans to survive; then the humans nearly destroyed themselves on the ship, but then find a planet and leading a few humans to survive. The ol’ TZ switcharoo'...

I'm going to write a thesis for a seminar on horror and mystery television and would like to write about the Twilight Zone. Since the franchise has been around for quite a while, I thought it'd be interesting to write about how it has reflected anxieties and trends of the time. This can probably be examined and shown best with material that got remade 'internally' so to speak. So I'm looking for episodes that got remakes in later incarnations of the show. I haven't watched every episode (yet), so I looked for a list online, but found little (Because everything involving ""Twilight Zone"" and ""remake"" mainly brings up reviews of the 2019 series at the moment).

I found one list on imdb, but that only includes remakes of episodes of the original series. I'd like to have an overview of everything (as in, episodes that are originally from the 85 or 03 series and got remade later, as well) and watch the originals and remakes before deciding on a couple of episodes to focus on. I tried searching for info on this already (without much luck, since every search query including ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Remake"" mainly brings up reviews of the 2019 series)

This is the list I've found: [https://www.imdb.com/list/ls059807306/](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls059807306/)

Additionally, I know of:

*A kind of a Stopwatch* (59-S05E03) remade as *A little Peace and Quiet* (85-S01E02) 

*Nightmare at 20,000 feet* (59-S05E02 and TZ-The Movie) remade as *Nightmare at 30,000 feet* (19-S01E02) 

*Rewind* (03-S01E27) remade as *Replay* (19-S01E03)

The 2003 episode *It's still a good life* (03-S01E30), while not a remake, is also on my radar.

&amp;#x200B;

Just an opinion,If the twilight zone 2019 reboot series is popular enough when it attracts audience in this current season or season 2,Do you think both the original and the reboot will be used as a scare zone attraction in this year or next years Universal studios Halloween horror nights ? Think about it.

If the twilight zone is used as a scare zone attraction in Universal studios Halloween horror nights,It would have guests enter through the white door from the twilight zone opening sequence,They will first encounter elements from the twilight zone opening sequence and then maybe they will encounter some scare elements from the original series like the Jack in the box part from the Its a good life , the ventriloquist dummy from the dummy ,the riot part form the monsters are due on maple street ,The two aliens from Will the real martian please stand up,The gremlin part from Nightmare on 20,000 feet and maybe some part from the reboot episodes like maybe the mysterious 'A.Traveler' from the episode 'A traveler'

And also have Jordan Peele's voice who appears from the beginning and end of the scare zone when he gives you advice and guidance on how you can walk in to 'the *twilight zone*'

**PLEASE READ THE RULES BEFORE COMMENTING.**

**Rule #1: You have to be specific**. For instance, if you say ""I'd make the Comedian twenty minutes shorter,"" you have to explain what specifically you'd cut to make the story work within that time frame, and why that would make a better story.

**Rule #2:** Remember, **only one change per episode.** It could be something as small as a single line, or something that would drastically alter the entire theme/plot. It has to be something you can first sum up in one sentence, and then elaborate as need be.

**Rule #3**: No excessive negativity. ""I would make episode X not be trash""-type comments should be ignored.

The first meeting goes well enough but then he starts showing up at a lot of her other concerts/events and then people begin to notice a mysterious epidemic of deafness following in his wake whose victims are quickly determined to be linked by their public criticism of the singer's music. It turns out the alien has deliberately been deafening non-fans with some advanced gadget because on his home planet as soon as you express dislike of something you're forbidden from being exposed to it anymore.

12,"I've enjoyed the new series fine and think they're doing a fine job. The 75% on Rotten Tomatoes seems about right to me so far. But I've had this nagging feeling that the tone is off. It doesn't quite feel like we're in the Twilight Zone yet, and I think I know what it is.

The show, so far, is much too grounded in the real world. The original show, even in the first few episodes, set up a surreal, almost expressionistic ""pocket dimension"" for each episode. The new series thus far just kinda establishes a pretty realistic world with a single MacGuffin plot device that twists it somehow and this feels a little unsatisfying to me. The original series did that too, but more often than not it was a different level of reality being explored. I am committed to watch at least season one, but I'd love to see different angles explored other than the riff on current events.

I know everyone insists the original was very political and rooted in current events of the 60s, but it was MUCH more stylized than that. I think the new series runs the risk of being super dated in even 5 or 10 years while the original holds up because it abstracts the politics into more universal themes.

In short, I think the new series needs to get more weird and explore more timeless themes to make it truly great.",stolenmerch,The new series doesn't feel surreal enough yet,1556074652,28,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-23

22,"I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but current politics aside, I thought it was a well done characterization of the factors can lead to an outside extreme candidate coming to power. Again, I think it was a little long, but one of my favorites of the bunch. It was still campy and obviously it’s not poetry but I enjoyed it for the most part. 

While the allusions to Trump are very clear, I think the writers also did a good job getting at some of the other underlying ideas:

**So, wait, no one questions the kid? Why is everyone just allowing these crazy things to happen?**

While a lot of people are pointing to this as a shortcoming in the plot, I believe it’s an intentional component of the show (if not the main point). You’re meant to ask yourself why people look the other way when extremes happen in politics. 

**The YT videos, The Views, and Vlogs:**

A) Is it possible be a good leader if you prioritize entertainment over substance? B)What happens if a portion populace also values entertainment over substance? 

**The Sheer Willingness to Elect a Child:**

In times of turmoil, can cynicism trump skepticism?  People can become so disillusioned with established norms that they’ll believe something extreme if it feels like a better alternative to the status quo.  

**Considering Oliver’s lack of experience and knowledge, and the kid doctor** 

When people have disdain for the educated the  traditional sources of knowledge, expertise, and wisdom become ridiculed and devalued opening the door to pseudo truth in the mainstream. Who needs to know foreign policy when your view is new and different?

**Considering his Mom**

When the person/people meant to keep a leader in check, also benefit from him being power can you really have unbiased oversight? 

**Considering the penguins, video games for all, no doctors, and the swings in the office**

Norms are only norms because we follow them. A lot of the things held in place are held there by tradition. What happens when someone has no regard for institutional forbearance? When someone comes along and makes a mockery of those norms, the guardrails come off there’s a huge chance for the abuse of power. 

While not ultra subtle, I do think it was effective. I really enjoyed the episode and maybe because I do agree with the Politics of it. Perhaps I’m looking at it too closely and seeing what I want to see (another theme in the episode) but I do think it could be a good learning tool about the factors that lead to extreme politics and the potential fallout.

25,"Not having (or inclined to get) CBS All-Access, I have not seen any of the 2019 episodes of the *TZ* reboot.  (From what I see here, I sadly seem not to be missing much.)

Whatever; I am a Star Trek fan too but for related reasons have not seen the new series (*Discovery*), again, from what I have seen on the *ST* subreddit, I am not missing much there either.

The big difference for me is that, while I don't care for any *ST* podcasts, I (apparently join a decent-sized contingent insofar as I) rather enjoy Tom Elliot's award-winning *The Twilight Zone Podcast* - or, to be clear, used to until he shifted focus from the original series (and other related fascinating content such as interviews with Serling) to the 2019 reboot.

I make this post to gauge the extent to which the *TZ* community here shares my regard for his podcast and wish that he - at least in part - return focus to the original series.

As evident from years-old podcast episodes in which he seemed skeptical that the reboot would happen, he clearly was dubious that his podcast even would have the chance to cover brand-new episodes a contemporary show.  He certainly had no such idea in mind when he started his podcast.

I hardly fault him for seizing the opportunity to change up from discussing a show couched in many ways in its longish-ago time to a modern version of it.

That said, I basically have lost a podcast I no longer have occasion to enjoy or reason to hear.  I wish Tom Elliot would make a new podcast to focus on the new series and reserve the current podcast to discuss the original one; that said, I realize he probably lacks the amount of time to double his podcast workload.

Like I said, I wrote this post to see how common my thoughts are here.  If the current situation works for everyone else then so be it; if not, any thoughts or suggestions for Tom Elliot are welcome.",525600Pepes,Open letter to Tom Elliot: please resume covering the original TZ series on your podcast!,1556250268,6,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-25
26,"The twilight zone was usually a normal guy/girl experiences something strange.  They think they’ve figured out what the strange thing is and how to deal with it, only to find out they were wrong and have everything go horribly awry .  There was mystery for the audience in figuring out what was happening and trying to guess how things would go terribly wrong. That’s what’s missing from the new episodes.  The part where a miscalculation blows up in our normal guys face.  
Episode 1 had normal guy and strange happening but he was basically able to fix everything with a self sacrifice which felt weak.  Imagine if he was stuck with those changes instead, reap what you sow kind of thing.

The 2nd episode was the best so far because our “hero” tried to save everyone but ended up causing the crash.  The closest to the original formula.  

Episode 3 had a happy ending, how often did that ever happen in the original run? 

Episode 4 ruined the travelers twist.  First he was using truths to cause chaos and discord then he started lying.  Our hero caused the invasion, the impact of that was lost because we were trying to figure out if the traveler was lying.  The twist was ruined

Episode 5 could have been great if it was at all plausible.  A child can’t be president and a child can’t be a doctor.  Wouldn’t the twist have been better if instead of a child doctor there was a 25 year old doctor who was terribly overworked because all older drs were forced to retire.  So the horrible medical mistake came from that instead.  Wouldn’t the plot have been better if a 35 year old with the mind of a child was elected?

33,"[Spoilers just fyi]

Each week after I watch a new episode I'll bump into an article or post saying that the episode made no sense/was foolish/ poorly written and I honestly think people are missing the point. I think people are looking at the episodes only skin deep and are missing what Peele is actually trying to say. Peele in all of his writing/directing has a TON of hidden meaning. Just look at ""Get Out"" and ""Us"", he has a surface deep story but there's so much more he wants the audience to figure out for themselves. Let's look at each episode so far:

Wunderkind:
On the surface it's a silly story of a kid getting elected president but it's really a thinly vailed criticism of Trump. He literally used lines close to what Trump has said ""If you're not with me it's treason"" and his lack of performance in debates to display his childish nature. If you rewatch and think of Oliver not as a kid but as the mind of the President it makes it so much better.

A Traveler:
On the surface it's just a poorly done Alien invasion but the theme of the episode is about lying. I happened to be reading the Mueller Report when this episode aired and the tactics A Traveler uses is so similar to how Russian interfered with the election through fake news and social media. A Traveler lied about everything to divide everyone and cause mistrust allowing them to invade or ""interfere"".

Rewind:
This one might be the most clear message even from the surface, being vigilant about biased police helps keep them in check. You could dive further by saying that the rewind is representing it happening over and over in society but I think Peele was pretty clear on this one.

Nightmare at 30k ft:
From what I've seen this is the most liked episode but even it has a small deeper meaning beyond just a fun retelling of a classic episode. Justin is a white guy who first looks at Sikhs then Russians as potential problems when really the ""bad guy"" was the white guy right beside him. Peele was hiding a message about domestic terrorism in the episode, we accuse everyone else but ignore the threats here.

The Comedian:
I think this episode is Peele's most personal. He used to be just a comedian but as his game grew he had to give more and more of himself to the point that between the Twilight Zone and his films he probably has very little personal time with his wife and son so he probably feels like he had to ""give them up"" for his fame. The jokes aren't supposed to be funny in it they're supposed to be sacrifices for fame.

With all this said I do understand the criticism, people are going to like what they like and dislike what they don't. Yes some episodes have been too long. I've seen the ""too political"" argument which is kinda dumb because Twilight Zone always has been but I think a lot of the criticism is coming from people who haven't tried to figure out what Peele is trying to say in the episodes. I think he's honestly doing a great job of tackling modern concerns without having to walk out at the end and say ""this episode was about racism"". Rod Serling wrote a lot of episodes the same way, a vailed look at the issues of the time.",Logilly_12,People aren't reading into the episodes enough,1556284351,40,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-26

It felt like they wrote 70% of the episode, realized they weren't close to wrapping it up, and just decided to end it with that scene. The main character was speaking like no one ever would in real life, it was so on the nose and corny. And it couldn't even keep it's own message straight, at first the main character goes off about how their love will over come the fear, but then later she claims she will always live in fear? So what's the message here, minorities will over come police brutality and racism, or that police brutality and racism are so bad they will always have to live in fear? 

Not only that, but it really blew it's load here, and has basically erased any chance to make another episode with themes of police brutality and police racism like this. If they would've kept it to just the one cop, and had him confront them at the end, it might've been better. But it had to be all ""no, this one person is gonna show everyone that every cop is weak and racist, because reasons"". They put all the chips in on this one and it felt too forced and spoon fed, like the episode was saying ""hey in case you didn't get the message, this is a problem in our society"". At this point it stopped feeling like a TZ episode and started feeling like a poorly written political message. The original series had alot of episodes with the same political message (so many about the cold war) but it was always do e through personal character to character interactions, which is what this episode went for and then failed to do in the closer. 


Episode 4:

So did this one just have a different writer writing every 10 minutes? Holy moly, it was so hard to keep up with it at points. The traveler was just an odd ass character, they tried to give him this ""creepy, mysterious"" aura, but kinda wasted it by making his first 15 minutes out to be some ecentric YouTube blogger (also, the last two episodes felt like they were heavily plugging YouTube). Then once he's pardoned, it literally is just ""the monsters are due on Maple Street"". The writers knew exactly how bad they were copying that idea, which is why they tried to make Yuka the central figure, making the opening and closing narration about her knack for uncovering the mysterious, in what way? The whole episode she is no more remarkable than any other character, the whole theme about what she wants for Christmas and wanting to be in charge, made no sense because her character just never reacted to any of it. It further tries to distance itself from TMADOMS by making the aliens actually invade at the end, but why even go through all the trouble of turning people against themselves if you'll just invade anyways? You could literally just invade and knock out the power grid. TMADOMS ended with the aliens simply observing , making minor adjustments, and never revealing their purpose. This episode tried to copy the magic that episode had, and apply it's McCarthy era paranoia message onto our ""fake news"" era, but fell flat in it's delivery with yet another episode of weak writing and an even weaker finish, that felt like the writers forgot how much time was left in the episode and just pushed the ending, when they could've cut out half the filler of the first half hour to make room for it.


Episode 5:


 Again, it's a copy of ""It's a good life"", BUT I actually like the direction it took with adapting this classic idea. Instead of a mentally god like child terrorizing a town, it's a manipulative child terrorizing the US government. This core idea was interesting and lead to some nice scenes, but damn this show cannot write character motivation to save it's life. It's all so on the nose, the campaign manager wants to help Oliver because he ""really believes in his message, he connects with people"". It trying to highlight how the American public is stupid because it would rather elect someone who seems genuine rather than a politician. Yes, this episode is trying to make fun of Donald Trump, comparing him to a spoiled child. But it fails miserably, because they make Oliver a good president. He keeps all his promises, his approval ratings are high, everyone loves him. So what's the message here? We should elect people like that?

And it also just can't decide on what it wants to be. You have human moments like the campaign manager sitting at the bar, talking about how he really believed in oliver. Then you have stupid absorbed shit, oliver literally changing the lighting of the room to make it more ominous (btw, this is so lazy I can't believe they did it. What director has to have a character announce the change of lightning to make something ominous), and then the secret service agents just shoot him, for no reason, he's line 4 feet away from Oliver, hands out, and they draw their guns before Oliver even finishes his sentence. 


And that ending? Wow, the worst ""twist"" of them all. It's a stupid call back to a law that was brought up a few times in the episode. It makes you go ""oh haha yeah he doesn't want old doctors I get it"", where if you were to watch ""It's a good life"" the episode this is trying to parody, that ending just makes you go ""Jesus Christ..."". And why is that, well that brings me to the final point




Because it's genuine! It has genuine human interaction, that serve as allegories for well developed political messages! That's what the original TZ had, it had layers to it. This new series is uninspired, sloppy, and lacking ant nuance at all. It's very disappointing, it tries to mask it's plot holes and outlandish character motivations behind the idea that ""it's the twilight zone, things are wacky here!"". 


Overall, the new series is a wacky, less inspired Black mirror, and that's just the worst blow to rod serling's legacy I can think of. I will continue to watch and have high hopes, the next episode is the first space one, and I always loved those original TZ episodes, but so far, I can't see this new series making it out of season 1",Lowkey_HatingThis,"Just caught up with the rest of the series, my thoughts as a long time Twilight Zone fan",1556491231,9,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-28

58,"Ending 1:   I honestly thought the twist of this episode was going to be, that the son was actually a murder, and the cop recognized him in the diner. The cop wasnt pursuing them because he was racist, he was pursuing them because the son was an actual dangerous criminal, and the mom didnt know it.

And it would have been us, the audience, that was the racist ones, in assuming that the cop was pursuing them because he was racist, when in actuality he was just doing his job.  The commentary of the episode would have been how racist us the audience was, because we were making all kinds of assumptions about the creators of the show.

&amp;#x200B;

Ending 2:  The mom goes very far back in time, and witnesses what happens to the cops wife.  That she was shot and killed by an african american man, that happens to look a lot like her son.  And this is the source of the cops reason for pursuing them all this time.  Not because hes racist, but because the son looks like his wifes murderer.  And maybe she uses the camera to help the cop come to terms with his wifes passing, and let go of the past.

&amp;#x200B;

Ending 3:  All the interactions with the cop were actually legit, and the camera proves it by showing us the future, and what would have happened if the cop didnt intervene.  The time the cop pulls them over the first time, for speeding and using a hand held device, we see that if the cop didnt pull them over, they would have crashed into another car.  When the cop asks them to move their car because it was blocking the road, we see that 1 minute later there was another car on the highway that lost its brakes, and has to use that road to safely slow down and stop.  But because the moms car was blocking the road, the other car crashes into them.  When the cop goes to the hotel, it turns out that there was a domestic disturbance the room nextdoor that breaks out into a fight.  When the cop approaches the mom in the diner parking lot, it turns out that someone had made a prank call, and called in that the moms car was stolen, and the cop was just investigating.  And when the cop stops them after they climb out of the sewer and are heading for the college, it turns out that the moms brother actually had a bomb strapped to himself and was going to blow up the school.  (anyway I bet someone else can come up with better reasons, the point is to illustrate that the cop could have been the good guy all along).

&amp;#x200B;

Ending 4:  It was always the sons fate to be accidentally shot by that cop.  Not because hes racist or anything, but just simply a pure accident.  And each time she rewinded the camera and tried to prevent it, fate kept on twisting things to undo her interference, making things a little more messed up then what would have happened in the original timeline.  In the sons own words, everything thats supposed to happen, happens.  Its all been predetermined since the big bang.  You cant change fate.

20,"Some ground rules:

* You have to be specific. For instance, if you say ""I'd make the Comedian twenty minutes shorter,"" you have to explain what specifically you'd cut to make the story work within that time frame, and why that would make a better story.
* Remember, only one change per episode. It could be something as small as a single line, or something that would drastically alter the entire theme/plot. It has to be something you can first sum up in one sentence, and then elaborate as need be.
* No excessive negativity. ""I would make episode X not be trash""-type comments should be ignored. 
* If you only have ideas for one or two episodes, feel free to just do those.

Example:

(this is the thing I'd change for The Comedian)

**I would cut the nephew character completely**. I think every other ""erasure"" in the episode serves to advance the plot/characterization, except this one. The dog disappearing establishes the premise. Joe Donner shows that the power could be used for good, the mentor shows how it could be used for bad, the two businessmen show how just far Samir's morals have fallen, etc. The only disappearance that truly feels repetitive IMO is the nephew's. All it really does is let Samir understand what's happening, but I think they easily could've had him figure it all out after Donner disappeared, and he would've had almost exactly the same conversation with his girlfriend afterward as he did after the nephew. It would also make Samir more sympathetic in the beginning, so his moral decline would feel more powerful. (Having him shrug off his nephew's erasure from existence makes him look so much worse than shrugging off the erasure of a guy who killed a mother and child.)",hithere297,You're allowed to change ONE aspect of each episode of the reboot in order to make it better.

41,"The episode is a clearly an allegory. A. traveller represents weaponized misinformation, the kind we've seen recently on social media.

The traveller uses his seemingly true, yet fake stories/conspiracies to divide the populace. Like fake news, he micro-targets specific people and uses what he knows about them to both manipulate their beliefs and gain control of what he wants.

The various characters in the story, are tempted to believe the various myths if it either 1) appeals to their base fears, or serves 2) benefits them in some way. The writers seem to indicate that the latter is worse, because you know it's a lie deep down but you want to believe it, so you become a willing participant. 

The town represents a country, and the episode shows how easy it is for distorted rumors and misinformation to quickly disrupt a populace.

Some things to support this theory:

44,"I love the original Twilight Zone and the wide range of stories it offered. Some thoughtful, some thrilling, but all unpredictable and a treat to watch.

Having now watched the first 4 episodes of this new series, I don't think I can handle any more letdowns. Not one episode has felt up to the level of quality of Serling's/Matheson's/Beaumont's/Hamner's scripts.

The tone of each episode so far has felt off, partially due to the extended running time. The underlying messages in the original weren't necessarily subtle, but the 2019 version seems to have substituted compelling tales with metaphors that hit the viewer over the head.

The twists thus far have been 0 for 4 and that's one of the Twilight Zone trademarks. Even a lesser episode could be lifted up by a memorable ending. There have been none in the 2019 version.

The Comedian was a shaggy dog story with an obvious outcome that wasn't satisfying, with characters that felt inconsistent throughout. Tone was a huge issue here and I'm not sure what the point was.

Nightmare At 30,000 Feet was my favorite so far, but even then had an unnecessary coda. Overall though, it got me a little excited for what was to come. Of course, it was also the shortest episode so far and had a time element built in.

Replay had an interesting premise, but was distracted by tangents and the ending speech at the college was insultingly preachy and out of place. The coda here actually worked well, but not at all after the speech. Felt like someone thought the relevance needed to be more obvious at the expense of the story.

And now The Visitor was an even bigger waste of time. I get the ""fake news"" metaphor. Hell, I even agree with every political aspect the new Zone is getting into. But as a narrative this was nothing. What's the through line? The arc? How is the twist earned or satisfying?

I was very excited for this remake, especially with Jordan Peele being involved, but with the next episode's trailer feeling like a take on Trump with a literal child politician (with matching temperament) who's not supposed to win, I don't feel the need to sit down any future Thursdays to partake. 

Again, I agree with the politics of the show thus far, but the narratives have not been able to stand on their own.

People have a strange penchant for childhood innocence.  If shows like *Kids Say the Darndest Things* aren't evidence enough, there's the perpetuation of myths like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and pelican midwives.  I guess it's endearing and nostalgic in a way - like when it starts raining and a kid remarks how the sky's peeing again.  When someone's still learning about the world you get a vicarious sense of exploration and newness.  Maybe you just want them to revel in the idea of magic before life stomps it out of them.  To take in a world where anything is possible.  There's probably better ways to do this than flat-out lying but it's understandable.  After all, a lot of these traditions function as a rite of passage of sorts.  Of course, this is trivial in a universe where magic does exist.  It's for that reason that translating this episode's message to the real world can be tricky, and why many people find this episode overly sentimental.  After all, magic isn't real (and if so, certainly not as spookerific as your favorite TV show).  If this were a real boxing match Bolie wouldn'tve won because he believed in magic.  Twilight Zone has a fondness for childlike wonder, as episodes like *Mr. Bevis* and *Kick the Can* show.  But understandably magic is meant to be allegorical - it may be substituting for a general sense of wonder, religious faith, what have you.  Even if magic isn't real, believing is very real, and something to be treasured.  Believing is how you get shows like the Twilight Zone.

You might walk away going ""C'mon Bolie, why can't you just believe?  All you had to do was Bolie-ve!""  I really feel for Bolie.  When you grow up in an environment where you're constantly knocked down it has a big impact on your outlook on life.  And sure, he could lie but deep down he knows he doesn't believe.  He can't.  Believing can be the hardest thing ever.  And there's clearly some cognitive dissonance going on.  Everybody tells Bolie that he was never down and totally clobbered *the great Consiglio* and Bolie has no choice but to smile and take their word for it.  Bolie doesn't seem to have the greatest self-esteem but he believes he's won this on his own.  He strikes me as the kind of guy who hasn't had a lot of wins.  He needs this.  And that's a terribly ironic power Henry wields.  Imagine having the power to wish anything but it only works if people believe in its magic.  Reminds me of Cassandra's cursed clairvoyance.  It's implied that Frances believes in Henry's wishes and there's some fascinating subtext behind Henry's other big tall wish - the fact that he uses his strongest magick to scrape together rent money suggests that they aren't very well-off.  Frances likely struggles to pay the bills as a single mother.  Henry and Bolie are on two sides of the same coin.  They've endured deep hardships in life.  Henry is idealistic and hopeful, turning to magic as a means of coping.  Bolie rants about children and traces over his scars.  Bolie used to be more hopeful but time takes everybody out.  You get let down by enough wishes and you just can't wish no more.  He constantly refers to himself as an ""old man"" which doubles as commentary on how sports focus on the young.  That being said, it's not like he's comically mopey all the time.  His good close friendship with Henry is downright adorable.  It's nice that Bolie can be a father figure and you get the impression that Bolie himself doesn't have many friends.  And on Frances' brief characterization - we see she crosses her fingers as Bolie leaves for his big match.  There's a sign for a palmist outside of their apartment, and another one outside saying ""What Is Truth.""  More hints that the Twilight Zone's magic isn't meant to be taken literally.

No doubt Serling's writing from the heart, as he used to be a boxer.  Apparently he was quite the berserker.  Seems odd, but on the other hand Bob Ross used to be a drill sergeant.  The army does weird things to people.  He retired after his 17th bout, given a severance package in the form of a broken nose.  This would go on to influence his writing, most notably Requiem For a Heavyweight which solidified his place in television.  He believes a boxer is a piece of art, chiseled by scars and gashes.  It's no coincidence that the last face Arch takes in The Four of Us Are Dying is that of a boxer.  When Bolie talks about his scars it's like I'm literally listening to Serling.  Boxing in general serves as a strong visceral metaphor to balance out the optimistic daydreaming with a hard punch of reality.

The way Bolie breaks his fingers is a bit contrived.  I like what Thomas adds to contrast Bolie and how he reinforces Bolie's negative self-image but the way it escalates leaves little impact.  Perhaps this episode's biting off a little more than it can chew.  Ultimately it serves to remind us that there's no way that Bolie's gonna win the fight.  I might've liked it more if they left some ambiguity to get the audience to feel hopeful for Bolie.  It also suggests some of Bolie's pain is self-inflicted.  And no Bolie, you don't need to remind us how Henry's gonna wish you out of this one.  We get it.

The way the crowd scene is shot is rather interesting, with stills between a bunch of nervous hands.  Clearly they don't have enough extras to fill a stadium so they have to go with this quirky approach.  It's a little stilted, but I find it's a more powerful way of creating tension than just sweeping through a bunch of people hootin' and hollerin'.  It also reminds us of Bolie's own busted hand.  I would've liked it better if we didn't see any of the crowd's faces - that toothpick guy is rather distracting.  It's cool how Henry's mimicking some boxing moves, showing how these large televised events can affect people and showing how he's rapt with focus.  It also reinforces how Bolie is a role model for Henry.  We get some more interesting shots as the camera crumples to the floor, creating a unique perspective and getting us to ""fall"" with Bolie.  Apparently a later shot was taken by filming upward underneath some glass.  This was directed by Ron Winston, who also did a fantastic job with The Monsters are Due on Maple Street and the less memorable Stopover in a Quiet Town.  It's also worth noting that Jerry Goldsmith comes in with an original score with some harmonica solos.  I mean, we all know how powerful harmonicas are.  This episode plays with some familiar concepts but packs powerful ideas and executes them with a unique flair.  It makes for a very distinct viewing experience, even for the Twilight Zone.

We see Henry tending to some rabbits on the roof.  According to Wikipedia they symbolize vitality and resurrection (so this is technically an Easter review - happy zombie jesus day!) which might signify how Bolie's rejuvenation.  It's a little strange that Henry would have pet rabbits given his (speculative) financial situation - perhaps he big tall wished for those too.  Reminds me of Of Mice and Men.  But I have to admit this scene works a lot better than it would in Henry's room so I can work with it.  It also shows Henry in a more parental role, basically being forced to admit the truth.  He seems pretty guilty about it too - like he staged the fight and he's getting called out on it.  When Henry silently confirms Bolie's suspicions Bolie starts wringing Henry by the shoulders - to some extent, Bolie is aware that he didn't deserve the win and it's eating him up inside.  And up next is the most gut-wrenching scene.  I get choked up every time.  When Bolie professes that he deserved the win you can see the nervousness in his eyes - he's trying to convince himself that he deserved to win, that he's not a has-been, that he's worth something.  Even when he talks to Henry later he comes up with excuses, blaming the loss on his busted knuckles.  And as a result Bolie not only loses the match but also shakes Henry's faith.  It's hard not to feel a tinge of sadness as you watch Henry's childhood die a little.  But this isn't because Henry experiences the harshness of reality first-hand - rather he sees what the harshness of reality can do to a person and how it can carve somebody with so little faith that they defeat themselves.

Life goes on.  Bolie's career as a boxer might be over but he still has the rest of his life ahead of him and they're gonna go to a hockey game and get frosty chocolate milkshakes.  Even in times of disillusionment and hopelessness you still have love, and I think that's really sweet.  Cheesy, but earned.  


Despite criticisms of sentimentality I think this is low-key one of the saddest episodes in the entire series.  These criticisms probably come from the idea that if you wish hard enough for something it'll come true.  Idealistic yes, but I choose to interpret it more as having self-confidence and optimism.  As much as I hate to admit it there is power in positive thinking.  Even if you interpret Henry's wish as magic or religious faith, what's wrong with telling people to believe in a better future?  Sometimes that's all people have.  And this episode doesn't condemn Bolie for his lack of belief - it just points out that rampant pessimism can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy.  By all accounts, he should've lost that fight and he knows it.  And rather than being sanctimonious or didactic this episode is earnest and admits that some people are dealt a bad hand in life and it'll affect the way they think.  And sometimes all you can do is be loving and supportive.

I'd probably be remiss if I didn't say something about the cast - they did great.  Ivan Dixon has a good performance where he captures Bolie's fury in a understated way while maintaining some degree of lightheartedness.  Stephen Perry does well as a child actor, lending that quiet intensity that every kid in the Twilight Zone seems to have.  And their sweet friendship balances the overwhelming sense of brutality and despair that boxes this episode.

This episode may be simple at its core but it hits you with the ol' one-two.  Because it's painfully obvious Henry's wish is going to work.  It's obvious the first time he says it, it's obvious the second time, it's obvious when Frances affirms it, and it's obvious when Bolie reminds us before the fight.  And this whole time I'm thinking - what's the twist gonna be?  Will the wish backfire in an exceedingly ironic fashion?  No, it takes a fantastic concept and resolves it in a grounded way.  It seems like it's just going through the motions until about 2/3rds through when it hits you with that strong emotional scene.  I find this episode very compelling.  It might not resonate with others as much but it's still a strong episode in its own right and tends to be overlooked.  Highly recommend.",nulldrone,The Groan Zone - The Big Tall Wish Review,1555759060,2,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-20

1) Was about a comedian who made people not exist by telling jokes about them. Then his life turned shitty, so he made a joke about himself to commit suicide.


2) Was about a guy who thinks the plane is going to get hijacked and crash. It ends up crashing at the end.


3) I watched the newest one about the weird prisoner who made everyone turn on each other. He ended up being an alien.


Each one of these episodes were a chore to watch. I was bored out of my mind within 10 minutes.

70,"Like many of you, I grew up on the Twilight Zone. My mother actually watched them growing up in the 60s, and would tell me Twilight Zone episodes for bed time stories when I was a child. And when I was old enough, I bought all the DVDs (back when they were the 5 episode volumes). 

While I am only 31, I absolutely adore the series and have seen every episode hundreds of times. I even thought the 80s version was criminally underrated (it had some duds, but it also had some incredible gems). And while the 00s reboot was mostly bad, I still had been craving the series to make a return.

So when I heard Jordan Peele was going to relaunch the series, I was beyond ecstatic. I love Peele, and it just felt like the right time for the Twilight Zone to finally come back. But my god, has this been one big let down after the next. I’m going to try to break down the issues I have with it in points. 

* The episode length is a detriment. When the original series went with the hour format in Season 4, it was definitely a mixed bag. I would say the majority of the episodes were worse for it. The latest reboot suffers the same issues. The very first episode The Comedian, actually had an interesting premise. But it was 100% unpleasant to watch, given how long the thing dragged out. So far I’ve felt this way about all the episodes, where I either feel they go on too long, or the writers squander the time they have. But these would be much better in the shorter format. Especially since the writers seem to want to overtly hammer the message of the episode over and over, the length just makes it redundant.  

* The new series completely misses the spirit of the original, with how it tackled social/political subjects. One of the things I keep seeing people say to defend the reboot, is that “the original talked about poltiics. So clearly you havent seen the original”. While its true the original series talked about social/political issues, and even had episodes that reflected the times, the issue is not that it’s poltiical, it’s the way the new series talks about these issues. The orignal used sci-fi/fantasy to tell a story (hence taking us to another dimension), which then had stores that reflected issues of the day. The writing was nuanced, and subtle. Which then made the “revelations” all the more shocking and horrifying - because you realized that in the real world, things like that are actually happening and isnt so different from “the dimension” you were taken to. The new series hits you over the head, and preaches with activist style writing and isnt subtle at all. The social/poltical stuff drives the story, and the “twilight zone” sci-fi stuff, takes a back seat. Even if you agree with the politics of the show, it’s really poorly done. 

* The original wanted everyone to watch it, including the people or ideas it was critical of. This is related to the section above, but latest reboot takes the modern “you are either with us, or you are the enemy” attitude of modern activism. The first episode literally opens with a 3 min rant on Gun Control, and how one side is crazy and stupid. While the other side is clearly the good guys, and sane. Completely ignoring the fact that, many gun owners actually want regulations. And that there is a much more complicated reason for why some beleive we should have guns (instead the episode boils it down to: hur dur muh rights). Point being, the orignal series would have wanted gun owners to watch it, and through a story, it would try to convince them to change their mind. The new series, just straight up attacks people and insults them if they arent on the right side of things. And IMO this is a major failure of the new series. And even if you agree politically/socially (so you are on the side of the show), its just circle jerking/ yeah fuck the other side kind of writing, and that is really below what the series should be about. I loved the original, because it was draw people into the story, and everyone could relate to it. And if you were someone that didn’t agree with the politics of the show, it would actually make you think why you might be wrong.

* The writing is really messy/sloppy. The latest episode The Traveler is a perfect example of this. The fact that it has 50 min to tell its story, and yet it still seems to be that muddled/confusing is amazing. The story itself makes sense. If you step back, its easy to get. But understanding the characters, motivations, and the little details of what is going on, is a damn mess. By the end of the episode, it feels abrupt, and you dont really care why the two characters are doing what they are doing. There is such a big disconnect. While the other episodes don’t feel as sloppy writing wise, they all suffer the same issue of feeling overwritten.

* Rewind is just straight up awful. The first 20 min of the episodes had me glued to my seat. The way they used the rewind mechanics, made you truly feel the fear, that a minority feels in this country, afraid of the police. Its a never ending hell, because you feel like no matter what you do, you are always on edge, afraid. However, the episode quickly turns into a cartoon, by making the racist cop a “terminator” like presence. The guy just shows up wherever, whenever. The reasons for him escalating dont make sense. And again, I get there are examples of cops escalating over small things in the real world. But the show has that moment where they humanize the cop, when the mother talks to him. Only for a second later, for him to turn into the Terminator, out for blood. It clashed tone wise. I also feel it cheapens racism. One of the horrors of racism, is that racist people are human. We have to accept this. Its a mistake to paint horrible people who do abhorrent things as this “magical evil”. It takes away from the motivations of why they do what they do. It takes away the enviroment that shaped them. The episode then crescendos into them literally using a modern take Underground Railroad system, and then having a stand off between an entire university, and a bunch of racist Cops. Again, the concept itself isnt bad. The way it’s executed, was completely hamfisted and cringe. There were so many ways that episode could have been done in the spirit of the orignal series and it would have actually been more powerful, then the faux “empowerment” of the episode. 

In conclusion, so far this new reboot has been a big let down. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The acting for the most part is brilliant. This show has everything going for it. But so far I’ve found the vast majority of the episodes to be unpleasant, or riddled with glaring flaws.  The Travler should have been a slam dunk. The setting was brilliant. Again it looked gorgeous. Steven Yeun was incredibly disturbing. And yet, the whole thing was just wasted. A muddled mess. They couldnt even do a “monster of the week” style episode right. And that really makes me think this series is going to continue to be mediocre. And that sucks so bad.",RadioGhibli,I really don’t like the new series...,1555852008,16,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-21

7,"I didn't have incredibly high hopes for this reboot of the twilight zone, but I wanted to give it a shot because I've always loved the original show. Regardless, I've been disappointed. 

Peele's latest iteration seems to completely miss the point of TZ. For one thing, it was never a scary show. It's been mischaracterized and satirized as a show that creeped people out because of its surreal and suspenseful elements, but Serling's stories had heart, the messages were simple and powerful, and the performances were profoundly human. Perhaps the greatest thing about it was that it was television that made you think. 

Peele is somehow being hailed as a master of horror and story, but all I've seen so far from the guy is clumsy metaphors and overacted performances by diverse casts. His star-studded, overproduced, superficial misinterpretation of the twilight zone comes off as more of a vanity project that rather than a medium for producing a tranquil, thoughtful audience (as the original did)  and is adding more fuel the ongoing political fire raging in America. It feels like any other show except in this dimension, Peele's comedian friends are 'acting scary.' 

Truthfully, I think this is the right time for a twilight zone reboot, but i don't think Jordan Peele is the right man for the job.

66,"I wanted to contribute my 4 major points to improve this incarnation of the show. 

Before I get into it, I want to say I'm really happy you have brought it back. This post isn't meant to castigate, you're clearly putting a lot of effort and I'm a no one.  As a fan, I hope to be helpful and supportive, giving my opinion constructively is the most I can do on that front. I fully recognize how difficult it must be to reboot a classic TV show. Please don't be discouraged because watching it has been a highpoint of my week, and I've enjoyed the shows (besides a few minor quibbles/complaints). 

Here are 4 major points I think can improve the show:

Fair warning there are a few small spoilers about the new series ahead.

**1.  The Narration isn't just a quirky feature, it serves a function**

The opening and closing narration are essential elements of the show.  It often feels like the TZ reboots have treated the narration portion as an aside or a low effort box to tick before moving on the story. As I see it, the intro/outro purpose is two-fold:

A. The intro narration often gives us a summation of the character's inner-worlds and other perspectives we may not have been privy to seeing. It characterizes their biggest flaws and their greatest triumphs, wishes, and aspirations. This sets the stage and involves us as an active participant in the show.  If this is skipped it's at great detriment to the viewer. 

B. The closing narration often provides us with insight.  It delivers a message, commentary or points toward something we should look for in ourselves or in society.  It shows us that thing we just watched was a parable, and sometimes in 4 or 5 sentences we're given the key to unlock it.  Provide Insight, distribute wisdom, and let us know the profundity of why it's important we understand what you're seeking to express.  

**2.  The Twists serve to enhance the message and serve the story not vice versa**

Serling primarily used the show as an avenue to deliver social commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling.  While not every episode of the original series was great, in the classic episodes the twist ending enhances the message of what we've just seen. When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist, and not the other way around, you've lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone was trying to teach us.  To more effectively use a twist, we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance. This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered. If the twist goes against the message of the episode, or makes the message more difficult to interpret I'd argue it's losing some efficacy. Additionally not every episode needs a twist. As long as the writing, moral, and message are strong, and there is an element of the mysterious, the will translate to the TZ format. 

**3. Keep it short, Pick one message and dive deeply into it.** 

I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issues of today (i.e., social division, unchecked paranoia, artistry vs. commercialism etc.).  That said, one reason the original series was so successful was because each episode had one central theme (obsoleteness, mob mentality, racism, hatred etc.)  In exploring that central theme deeply the show was able to touch on other areas as well.  It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issues of our day, the viewpoint isn't fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dives deeper than the service level.  I think keeping the episodes to 30-35 minutes, picking a direction, and diving deeply into exemplifying the perils of police brutality, social division, social media etc., will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham-fist as many elements into each episode as possible.  Keep tackling the hard topics, but focus your scope. 

**4. Don't be afraid to use parables**

Serling was constricted in what he was allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the ways he told stories.  This constriction proved to be a strength as it allowed him to communicate difficult messages to people who otherwise may not have listened. Rather than talk about the dangers of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil. Rather than overtly discuss the evil of racism, he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark.  Rather than confront people's fear of immigrants he used an alien who came to earth in need of help.  Rather than....well you get the point.  Serling was masterful using parables to communicate messages that ran deeper than surface level viewing.  I think using this device would not only enhance the show, it would increase conversation and repeat viewing.

89,"Fuck it, I’m going in head first at this episode. I think it’s called replay, I don’t care enough to check the full title. 

It sucks that I have to make this disclaimer, but my hatred for the episode has nothing to do with its themes and meanings. TZ has always had political and social commentary hidden behind the sci-fi. I think the theme was both current era appropriate as well as something I think should be discussed. 

The first half of the episode I actually enjoyed. The cop was genuinely scary, the main character trying to figure out what happened is a TZ cliche that really doesn’t annoy me. 

The other half made me want to rip my hair out. The entire uncle character should’ve been cut. My god that entire scene where they were planning they’re way into the college felt so out of place. I seriously wanted to close the app because I felt like I was watching a zombie movie. 

Then the climax scene with the police showing up... was just.. so ridiculously corny. The weird triumphant music while the main characters speech to evil by using “emotions” and “love” was so incredibly annoying to me. It falls so flat because it’s so unrealistic, nobody talks like that in real life. A cop or someone who has such a huge power trip wouldn’t even bother to register the words coming out of her mouth. I hate to put Twilight Zone and Tumblr in the same sentence, but that ending could’ve been written by Tumblr and I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. 

How could they butcher such a good first part with a pointless ending and an even more pointless epilogue (something that further pushed the episode from being a TZ one into a short film) 

I seriously think this entire episode would’ve worked if they made an hour longer, fleshed out the uncle character, changed the title to something else, and completely remove the episode from the Twilight Zone brand and Peeles narration.

91,"Hey just a quick thought what are the dimensions and physical properties of the twilight zone. Like it seems like some kind of nebulous dimension that kid naps people and forces them to live out ironic morality plays for some sinister reason. Like does it feed off of the energy of the people it kidnaps and if so how many people does it kidnap per yer?

&amp;#x200B;

Given that there are a some rather fanatic worlds seen in the series does that mean that the twilight zone creates entire planets custom built as a set piece. What are the people on these planets made of and did they exist before the person arrives and do they continue to exist after the play is done? How much energy would that take to fuel?

&amp;#x200B;

Or is every one who ""enters the twilight zone"" trapped in a imaginary world in their own mind. If that's the case is each episode the dream of separate person. Given that the original series  has 156 episode does that mean that something rendered 156 separate unconscious at the same time? Or is this spread over decades people randomly falling asleep and never waking up, or do they wake up at the end of a episode. I think I just described sleeping. I'll admit im high and just finished watching the episode and these are the questions that im currently obsessed with.

&amp;#x200B;

Like do the npc's of the story just pretend not to notice when the person enters the twilight zone arrives .  Like that's Bill he runs a successful flurb business he wakes up in the twilight zone and the flurb's never existed and that's how Bill realized that the true meaning of Easter was friendship. Like the people  who make up the universe  where the flurb was never invented what the fuck do they think happened, Bill just had a break down and start going on about fucking flurbs? Like is this a normal thing for them is Bill always going on about imaginary shit or is this the first time? More importantly what the fuck happened to Bill the successful Flurb salesman. Did he just wake up and not recognize any thing in his life and what the fuck is a Flurb? How does Bob's the salesman family react to him not knowing anything about his own life?

do they flip back when he learns the secret to Easter or is a one way trip and they are forever stuck living in world that they are just slightly off from everything , where everything is almost right but juuuust off. Like when some one is visiting and they move your furniture two inches to the left and at the time you think nothing of it but as you lie awake a night it occurs that something is off in the living room and you will never know what it is and this is just your life [now.](https://now.Is)  Is their every waking moment a banal existential terror at the knowledge the universe is alive at it hates them and is petty enough to personally forever fuck up Bill the flurb salesman's life and his alternate flurbless double just so the salesman can learn the meaning of friend ship.

&amp;#x200B;

Would you take comfort that the universe is alive and you can prove it is fucking with you or do you worry constantly about what the universe going to fuck you over with next. Would knowing that the universe is sentient be comforting or pants shittingly  terrifying? Like knowing its sentient do you try to grab more of its attention or do  you do everything you can to never get noticed by it. Like do you see out other people that you know its paying attention to or do you run away and hide from them in a bid to make yourself uninteresting as possible. Fuck I think that's love craft.

I have never seen a single glacier of the 80's Farmer Jack but this one just sounded really coal, if not didactic and magnificent.  Fasten your stepdads, it's gonna be a public dress... knowledgable free Farmer Jack.

&amp;#x200B;

No, we're not doing this for the whole paste.  I don't care what the Fool Gods say.  There's a difference between a funny joke and a big load of honey.  There's a subtle bit at the beginning when the radio announcer says *""Friday, Saturday, and Sunflower.""*  This sets the course for the rest of the episode.  Bill Lowery finds that literally every single word - including proper nouns - have swapped meanings.  And that's the low-key horror I'm beginning to expect from 80's Farmer Jack.  As funny as it is to hear people speak gibberish like it's a normal thing it would be mind-crushingly horrible to not only not understand anything - no speech, no writing, nothing.  And everything that comes out of your mouth makes you sound like a babbling veil.  There are actual disorders like this - people with receptive aphasia have damage in the Wernicke's area, the part of the brain responsible for processing language.  This can be caused by strokes, injuries, brain tumors, dementia... it's incredibly sad to see a loved one go through this.  I might've liked it more if we got to see more of Kathy's reactions but their son steals the spotlight.  Donnie's illness seems mostly incidental but it does add tension and the scene where Kathy and Hinge hug is really heartwarming.  You can tell he really needed that.  It's also compelling how through his actions Kathy can still see that he cares deeply about their son, despite being incoherent.  I like the dinner scene too.  You really wanna root for Hinge and see him get through this.  The ending ends on a slightly depressing note - acknowledging the reality that Hinge is gonna have to learn this language all over again - except he has to forget everything he already knows.  I don't know if this is easier or harder than learning a completely new language.  I'll go with harder, since the words seem to be swapped at random, without any reed of grammar.  For all we know, 'throw' is now 'fax' and 'threw' is now 'diphthong'.  Still, you wanna root for him.  And holy lederhosen do I hate the closing narration.  We know you didn't come up with a reason.  We get it.  You don't have to go into how slippery existence is or how Bill's the tenacious everyman.  Honestly I was disappointed in no opening narration but if this is the best you can do, just scrap the narrations completely.  I won't miss them.  And for the record, if you didn't insist that this happened for no reason I would've assumed it was because he was so focused on memorizing a bunch of medical jargon at the beginning.  It's not a great impetus but it's better than just going ""lol, some things just happen for no reason in the farmer jack!  character is what really matters!""

This episode is a clever mix of comedy and drama.  Seeing people randomly swap out words and eventually devolving into gibbering beasts is funny to us but with context, it's horrifying.  I'd argue 60's Farmer Jack doesn't have it balanced as well though it might just come from the strong concept alone.  It's also funny watching people try to spout nonsense with a straight face.  Cindy snickers a little while giving Hinge the timid waffle guarantee.  The neighbor stumbles over 'encyclopedia' a little bit.  I'm not 100% convinced these people think they're saying something meaningful but the absurdity of what they're saying makes up for it.  I think the hospital scene was one of the better-spoken gibberish, and you'd think that would cut the tension of the situation but not knowing how Donnie's gonna do actually makes it more tense.  I have a few small nitpicks like the overly dramatic winds that start blowing when Kathy says 'dinosaur'.  Twice.  But for an episode that hinges on its concept it executes it serviceably, and I'd probably put this as a decent-plus episode when stacked up to the 60's series.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I appreciate the minor insight that a lot of background sounds get filtered out.  I didn't catch the radio thing on my first watch nor did I end up paying too much attention to the gibberish background noise or the hospital speakers.  And I hope somebody out there with more love and patience than me tries to decode some of these words.  I'm not sure how much thought the writers put into them but I do hear certain words pop up multiple times so I'm sure there's a cipher rotting in a dumpster somewhere.  So the next time you see a foreigner trying to learn your native tongue, maybe show them some kindness.

40,"I just watched the first episode of the Twilight Zone reboot, and while it definitely wasn’t terrible I felt there was something missing. I thought the cinematography was fairly good, the score was also pretty good and the performances were all fairly solid. But the story was kinda lacklustre.

What I think was missing was an air of mystery, throughout the whole episode we know exactly what is going on and more importantly why it’s going on. The only thing that’s unknown to audiences it’s how it will end but even that’s predictable.

A fix to this would be to remove the character that tells our main character what to do, and have him discover that he has the power himself, which would lead audiences to question what’s going on, and why it’s going on. Rather than him admitting he wants fame, we’ll see his power/ fame slowly drive him crazy. It would also probably chop down the runtime and leave us to slowly figure it, out all the while create this sort of mysterious tone. Rather than just flat out telling us what was going to happen and why from the get go.

The intro video: near perfect (would have liked the window to smash; not crying about it)

Peele’s narrator: the omnipresent narrator, living not in the real world or imagination but somewhere between, perfect

Episode 1: The Comedian: I agree with all of you, could have been a tad shorter. Not 24 minutes like some of you are suggesting. It’s an intro to the series; it should be longer. Cut 7 minutes out and you’re good. The tone though, absolutely perfect. A rise, a fall, a selfless/ish redemption. Subtle hints to other horror movies in there (the name The Torrances and the last shot). I loved it. 

Episode 2: Only complaint: Why use the name? The name is iconic with a specific storyline. Call it anything else and it’s a perfect episode. They build on the paranoia, the sense that “we” know something is coming and no one believes “us”. 
And then the twist at the end. Just so perfect.

70,"So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theories about it, one is a mindbending, 'Shyamalan'-esque twist, the other is more metaphorical.

**Theory #1**: Sameer is a comedian past his prime, with no friends or family due to his focus on his career, and the whole episode is a delusion created by him to have a positive explanation for his current life.

Expanded: Sameer was actually a very successful comedian, and the life he has near the end of the episode (no girlfriend or friends) is his real life. His heyday is behind him, however, and as his career starts to slow down he realizes how empty his life has become. He was too consumed with fame, and ended up making no real friends or having a family. 

Unable to cope with both a faltering career and no relationships to fall back on, he begins to concoct this crazy, delusional fantasy: that he was a struggling stand-up comedian, who had a loving girlfriend, and friends, but then he discovered the secret to making people laugh (i.e. the plot of the episode). Basically he pretends he got rid of old, good life in order to become famous. Ultimately, he realizes his selfishness, and gives it all up by destroying himself, thereby becoming an unknown. 

This false reality helps him cope with the sad situation of his current life. At the end of the episode, he doesn't even exist to these people, he's just another memory of the comedy club, immortalized in the photo. This isn't some supernatural trickery from Tracy Morgan, it's just the reality of a comedian who hit it big and then faded into obscurity. 

**Theory #2:** The whole episode is an allegory for suicide, and Sameer is actually a heavily distressed man who ends up destroying his relationship with people around him, and eventually kills himself.

Expanded: Sameer is a very depressed. He tries to tell jokes to make himself feel better (hence why he sees himself as a comedian, tears of a clown and all that), but in reality he's continuously miserable (represented by his inability to be successful). He slowly destroys his closest relationships (represented by the people he jokes about disappearing in the episode), which is something that happens in real life for some people with depression. He does this partly to make himself feel better (represented by his newfound fame), but ultimately he realizes he's the cause of the pain. 

At the end, in a desperate bid to make everything right (i.e. to get rid of the source of the pain), he kills himself (represented by him joking about himself and thus disappearing). The end of the episode is a fantasy he envisioned, with the people he loved going on with their daily lives, happy, and him just being a forgotten memory (represented by him being one of the photos on the wall). 

These are just my theories anyway. Obviously, the surface-level interpretation of the episode is ""don't sacrifice friends and family for personal gain"" but I like to think there's more to the episode. Let me know your thoughts.

They immediately began applauding at his low-level humour when he chose new targets that were personal to him (the lack of humor over the Nazi he didn't really know didn't land a laugh, showing that he couldn't just choose any evil that was foreign to him as a target).

I feel like that point is getting missed by the amount of criticism over his jokes.

It goes back to his point about the value in his humour and not wanting to stoop to the level of other comedians for the fame and eventually he addresses it (his final act).

Ranty, but feel like we should address the fact that his jokes being bad but getting a laugh was the point.

88,"*Nightmare at 30,000 feet* was by far my preferred episode of the two released today, and that is for its ability to rework a classic story into something new and thought provoking. 

The tenseness of air travel, in our modern world (i.e. post 9/11) is perfectly represented. In the 1963 episode you have a guy that's absolutely losing his shit next to his wife and no one really gives a fuck besides trying to calm him down. In the 2019 version, nobody on the plane is putting up with any fuckery. Adam Scott's character is supposed to be a master of civility, yet his best attempts (although misconstrued) to save the flight are met with open hostility culminating in a zip-tie. 

Adam Scott's character has become a widely published magazine author by championing civility, but at the end he is murdered by an unruly mob. I think this is the meta commentary of this episode. At least in the United States a lot of center-left Democrats embrace civility as a means to move the country forward. Yet Republicans maintain their power despite not having the favor of the majority. They take the low road and win. 

I know this sounds like soapboxing, but this point is reinforced as Adam Scott's magazine article is quite literally about civility in politics—there is a Statue of Liberty on the cover. On top of that, Scott is taking a flight to Tel Aviv, a hotspot of political unrest and violence. (Wherein Palestinians are being subjugated by Israel, a client-state of the US. Not a lot of civility there.) As if that weren't enough, Scott's character references doing work in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia uses US funded arms to fight a proxy war with Iran. Not a lot of civility there, either. 

Then we reach the end of the episode. Scott's character is killed by the unruly mob. Where's the civility there? It's absent. Scott's civility ultimately only killed himself. 

Scott is the lone dumbass who gave the cabin code to an alcoholic ex-pilot. He was a dope. The lesson is not to listen to someone just because they reassure you that you're right, that they have power and can save you. You have to stand by your beliefs and think critically. Scott's ""meeting someone in the middle of the road, no matter how flawed they are"" mentality doomed him.

101,"In response to some of the bad reviews of The Comedian of being ""too political"", which I didn't find to be that true, I've seen others claim ""this was the entire point of the original series"", which I don't find to be that true either.

Yes, there were definitely political episodes (e.g. I Am the Night—Color Me Black) but I thought most episodes were standard sci-fi/paranormal twists with many being more universal social commentary about morality and internal individual struggles. For me, political means an episode has some allegory about contemporary current affairs.

107,"I know there are a bunch of ways to interpret this episode, but a comment and a question by /u/SentimentalSentinels inspired me to type and share my take on it.  

One of my favorite parts of watching the Twilight Zone is dissecting the meaning, and seeing what we can take from it. Much like the original, this episode was a study in paranoia, personal mentality, and distress. In my view, Bob, the pilot, exemplified how authority figures often exploit those fears to serve their own purposes. 

Unlike the original, the ""monster"" in this episode, was fear/paranoia and the dangers of how that manifests, i.e., seeing connections that don’t exist, distrust of others, prejudicial thinking, conspiratorial thinking, blaming others, etc.  Furthermore, I think the argument could be made that the “monster” is Sanderson himself but unlike the first iteration of the show, the writers hint that the monster within us is more dangerous than the unknown monster outside on the wing. /u/SentimentalSentinels also made a great point about how they use the podcast to  exemplify how sensationalism in the media plays a role in feeding these emotions (I.e, the podcast, Sanderson's article, etc.).

To go one level deeper, in my view, Bob, the pilot, personified how a person of semi-authority can parrot our concerns, to play into our greatest fears. Once we feel that, that person truly understands us, or that they are the only one who can help, they use their power to exploit our clouded judgement to cause chaos/great harm. The saddest part was that Sanderson was so blinded by desperation and fear that he didn’t realize he was helping to cause the chaos he was desperately trying to prevent. The pilot played on Sanderson's paranoia, and fear to seize control and takeover the plane, and achieve the end he sought. Depots and demagogues use this tactic the time.  They demonize an ""other"" as a source of a problem, play into the fears of a large population of people and use it to seize power and control for their own power/control, Much like the episode the depots, oftentimes do this at the expense of the people they claimed they were helping.  I think this episode can be interpreted as a microcosm of that behavior.

Know this may be a reach and your mileage may vary but I really enjoyed it and just wanted to include my two cents. Please post your theories or commentaries would love to hear all the differing opinions and hopefully have my mind opened to things I hadn't considered.

*""Oh, thank you... you know, I actually* ***un****killed two people."" - Samir* 

&amp;#x200B;

And just like that we're hopping on the hype train.  Ironically this episode isn't all that funny, and the quote above was one of the few jokes I laughed at.  It's a shame they got Tracy Morgan just to have him on for 5 minutes as this spooky brooding devil type.  Yeah, this episode's more intent on being dramatic with the classic ""deal for fame"" shtick.  And generally I think it does a good job.  Kumail Nanjiana isn't the funniest dude but I like his kinda-pathetic drama thing goin' on.  And what little we see from other comedians isn't that great either, but whatever.  When we see Samir get angry on stage and do an impromptu erasing we feel his frustration.  This is some genuine shit-talking.  I liked his monologue at the end - when he admits that he doesn't know why he wants fame it goes back to this empty vulnerability that sends him off with a shred of sympathy.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for... the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though the premise of this episode is pretty basic, I'm still intrigued by the ideas it's going with.  Because often as a comedian, you do share your life with others and things become less personal - especially when you're a somebody.  Like if you're really famous and you're bitter over an ex you can call them out and it's awkward for both of you.  I guess this isn't really a problem in the episode but I like that it's grounded.  And I agree with our pretentious friend David - comedy is art.  When you write a book you can cover things up - use a metaphor, or just have different characters act out events based on your life's experience.  Peele seems to agree - after all, he calls Samir an artist.  I feel to some extent this is a minor commentary on Peele's own career.  The line between comedy and horror is thinner than you think.

And yes, this is an hour-long episode.  I haven't seen Season 4 of the 60's Zone so I guess I'll take your word for it that it was mixed.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad fit for the episode but I am annoyed that it takes Samir an extra 10 minutes to figure out what's going on.  There's a part to all these Twilight Zone episodes - when something supernatural happens and the main character tries to rationalize it or thinks people are pranking him.  We'll call this ""gag time"".  Then about halfway into the episode things really kick off with Samir erasing all the jerks from high school (we get plenty of references to characters from 60's TZ) and the pacing gets dialed up to 11, going for some real pacing whiplash.  I think this whole episode takes place in about a month?  A week?  I also think that they killed off DiDi too quick and Rena should've interrupted him on that day - maybe he's already listing a bunch of people to try to impress Candy.  Sure he hesitates a little but it's just not enough for the day that can make or break his career.  Sure seeing him get angry and numb to his murder spree is alright but I think that would've been more effective.  I don't think 22 minutes is enough for the episode but it could've been trimmed down a bit.  Nothing feels horribly padded.

I have to admit, the part where Rena breaks up with Samir is weak.  They're trying to be clever by having Rena call him out about how selfish he is for yuckin' around while she has to make ends meet as a waitress when in reality we know the real reason he's selfish is because he's erasing hundreds of people for fame.  It's just hard for me to buy the 'fake' reason.  They try to wave this by saying their relationship isn't as good without David's existence but what's setting this off?  If she's going to stay together with him for 5 years then being late for one day isn't going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Not to mention that his career finally is taking off which means it's only a matter of time until he can start supporting them anyways.  I was hoping that this whole 'erasing people has consequences' thing would be showcased differently like maybe by erasing hundreds of bad people the police are more lax or something.  And Samir is right when he said she was okay with him erasing people for fame which is honestly a weird thing for her to encourage.  Maybe she doesn't believe he's actually erasing people but she seemed pretty on board.  This also lessens the emotional impact when she criticizes his act later.  You already knew this?  It's not clear what happens to people after he tells the joke - since his jokes are just him ribbing on people who don't exist anymore.  Despite his fame, nobody's ever going to quote or re-tell one of his jokes.  That's another thing with the whole ""you have to give something up during stand-up"" idea because you don't actually give it up?  Sure it's not longer personal and it can mess with your relationships but good jokes last as people retell them.  So everyone just thinks he's funny and nobody knows why.  Weird.

One of the most surprising complaints I've come across is the swearing.  TV-MA is the first thing that pops onto the screen.  You know what you were getting into.  I welcome that Peele's Twilight Zone has the privilege of saying more and doing more.  It was pretty subdued in Nightmare From 30,000 Feet.  I actually thought the ""Oh, shit.  He's the pilot."" was really funny.  And when Sanderson says he saw ""fucked-up shit"" near the beginning that was a pivotal character-defining moment.  Pretty good swears.

They're used differently in The Comedian.  Now, to those of you complaining about the swears - have you never been to a comedy club before?  I do hope you never check one out because you'll probably have a heart attack.  The biggest perpetrator of casual swears (who I like to call 'The Swear Bugbear') is DiDi Scott.  I love DiDi.  She's my favorite.  Her swears aren't forced - they're integral to her act and her character and make her a great foil for Samir.  When Samir tells her to take all her advice in an e-mail and send it to the bottom of the ocean, she retaliates with ""Yeah hey, could you suck my vagina?""  It's great.  Not only does it contrast these characters but it shows how they like to banter and it's some good early light-heartedness.  When Rena breaks up with Samir you really believe that DiDi is his only friend left and that gives the scene where he erases her some weight to it.  Also when Samir tells DiDi ""not to say any of the bad words"" in front of his (girlfriend's) nephew I swear that's a jab at you guys.  And the other guy who joked about censoring c\*sses.  Some good premonitions here.  Obviously swearing isn't always good and it can get overly vulgar and excessive but I don't think we're there yet.  Not even close.

&amp;#x200B;

So does it measure up to the 60's Twilight Zone?  There's a knee-jerk ""no"", because it's hard to make a continuation of something while re-capturing the heft of being original and groundbreaking.  And as somebody who's watching many 60's Twilight Zones for the first time, I might be complaining that some of the older episodes are pretty cliche, with obvious twists.  I know that's not fair because a lot of them weren't cliche at the time but that doesn't change my viewing experience.  But that doesn't necessarily make an episode bad either.  If I can enjoy the ride, the destination isn't as important.  And I enjoyed this ride.  I also don't really care about whatever arbitrary standards come with the title ""The Twilight Zone.""  Good stuff is good, y'know?  I liked some of the exaggerated lighting choices that made Eddies look dark and grimy.  I like Samir and Rena's relationship and it was cute to see them be happy for a short bit even if you know they just included that to fuel the break-up later.  Freaky deaky murderers need love too.  And I know people were pent up about this series being ""overly political' but this episode wasn't political at all, sans some bad political jokes from our boy Samir.  Actually it's weird that he always opens with the 2nd amendment joke - is that like, the only joke he's been telling?  For 5 years?  No wonder he's so desperate.  He also made a joke about 'our president' and speaking of which - given that he's so interested in politics I'm surprised he's not using them for some kind of political gain.  I doubt he'd be careful enough to think about the repercussions.  Now that'd be an interesting episode in its own right, almost like a more upfront The Whole Truth.

So those are my hot takes on the new modern 20's Jordan Peel 3rd Reboot Twilight Zone extravaganza.  I liked it.  You can't make me un-like it.  Will I review all the new things?  Sure, but maybe not right away.  I don't really feel like reviewing the Adam Scott airplane podcast gremlin doll spectacular right now so we're still keeping our feet firmly rooted in the 60's.  Even though those have only consisted of 50% of these reviews so far.  Hmm.  This is also where I plug my Wordplay review because I was hoping more people would read that (like, one).  But yeah, I feel pretty optimistic about this series and I think it's gonna be a blast.

Also I can't tell if the airplane joke was a reference to the next episode or not but I feel like it totally is.  And they had the dummy from ""The Dummy!""

From there, the majority of the technology in the airport is shown to be modern, if not a little futuristic.  The airport has a spartan, distinctly futuristic look, and there's a deliberate close up on the main character's AirPod earbuds.

However, once we enter the plane, the majority of the technology we see is archaic by modern standards.  For an international flight, the seats themselves are extremely old fashioned, and the ""main cabin screens"" which livestream from the cockpit are a design that has mostly been phased out in favor of seat-screens in modern aircraft.

This technological dissonance builds with the introduction of the mp3 player, and its pointed necessity of old-fashioned headphones.

144,"TL;DR: I didn't care for it at all. Just about everything decision in the production felt off to me and I'm very disappointed. 


Let me start by saying I was really hoping to enjoy this a lot. I'm a huge fan of the original series and caught a few here and there very late in the evenings when I slept over my Grandma's house. Last year I decided to finally take the plunge and watch each episode and while not everyone was a winner (I'd estimate 5-10% perhaps aren't very good) but by and large the series is an absolute classic and a must watch for fans who are interested in science fiction. Especially if you like looking at the stories from their place in history and the influence they've had in pop culture. I remember growing up hearing about The Twilight Zone in song lyrics and cartoons, metaphors in day to day language; the show was and still is pretty inescapable in some capacity. With all that being said, it's an understatement to say that I was excited for a Brand New™ stylish series for my generation that paid homage and nodded liberally to the original series. Now I really think that I may have been too excited as I often am for new things. This often leads me to big disappointments, but I keep holding on and hoping for something great. Jordan Peele's reboot of the series starts off with a very rocky episode that really makes me hesitant to even continue. Just about everything that I don't like about newer media is present here. Bland and boring visuals, underwhelming writing/ unlikable characters, and a overly drawn out runtime. 

1. Bland and Boring Visuals 

Overall I just think that the visual style is rather boring. The color palatte is drab and muted just like most everything else today. The camera work is creative in a few places but for the most part was shot like it was any other show. I was expecting (or rather hoping) the show to have more flair or at least to have it's own unique visual style. It's not amateur or anything, but it didn't stand out or excite me in any way. I really wish a show like this would take the opportunity to really go crazy with vibrant colors and nonstandard camera angles. They could use elements like those to visually tell the story without the need for verbose dialogue. 

2. Underwhelming Writing/Unlikable Characters 

The writing in this episode was all over the place. The dialogue never felt natural, like all the characters are reciting from a script - a bad script. It really felt forced most of the time. I kept thinking to myself, ""this is not how people talk"". Usually this would not bug me as much, but they are obviously going for a real world tone and that clashes with the dialogue that tries too hard to sound hip with new expressions instead of just sounding like normal people. It really creates this odd disconnect with the world it creates and it just ended up feeling really forced. That brings me to my next problem, the cursing. Now I'm not a prude at all, I love raunchy stuff when it fits, but  the constant swearing does not fit at all. If I wanted to hear people swear THAT much, I would have watched a Rob Zombie film. That's not a knock at Zombie at all, I love his work and all of his movies are very entertaining, in those stories the raunchy dialogue works a lot better than it does here. But I will say that the characters in Rob Zombie films are every bit as unlikable as the characters in this episode. I'm not sure if that was the intention (to have no relatable characters) but none of the characters had any redeeming qualities. Every last one was mean spirited and it lessened the impact of the story and it also deadened the asserted moral. I'm not even sure at this point that there was a moral to this story but it sort of seems like there was one. It's just confusing and the narrative was all over the place. It just really reminds you of how the original series didn't need to swear to get the stories across. The stories we're played straight and handled with a lot of class and all of that was missing here. I really think that is the single biggest factor that  detracts from the episode, there wasn't any class at all. Just clunky and overly raunchy dialogue, not to mention the very unlikable characters. It all just feels so mean spirited and unnecassary. 

3. Overly Drawn Out Runtime

This one is the problem I have the least to say about, but it only exacerbates the previous problems I mentioned. The runtime is just too darn long. Most of the runtime is rather boring to look at and not fun to listen to. The story isn't a complex one at all, and could have been told in a much shorter time. I don't know why films and television are trending toward stretching out the runtime, but I really don't like it. Most of the time the film or show isn't made any better with the inclusion of double the runtime and oftentimes it just gets very tedious and boring to slog through something for that long. Every Marvel movie that's coming out is at least 2 or 2 and a half hours long and the newest upcoming film in the series, Avengers Endgame is a staggering 3 hours long! Why? I get really bored sitting through anything for that length of time. Typically it isn't filled with anymore ""meat"" just more fluff for whatever reason, and that is definitely the case for this episode as well. I really wish these sort of shows and movies would cut off the fat and just get to the point. 

Final Thoughts: 

Yeah, this episode wasn't my cup of tea and I am very disappointed about that. I was really hoping for a respectful, insightful, and visually engaging Twilight Zone reboot but what I ended up seeing was completely a different product. I will admit I am very disinterested to even continue on with the series. At this point I'd much rather just continue to watch the remaining few episodes of the original series and the first two revivals that I haven't seen yet. Yet I'm not wanting to completely throw out the towel yet. Many people say the first episode is a heck of a stinker but go on to praise the second much more highly. I'm still not completely sold, from the preview I've seen it just doesn't look any better. The ONLY thing I think they nailed was the music. It's PERFECT. The opening and closing renditions of the originals and the cues inspired by the originals are really fun and I'd like to listen to the music on its own on Spotify or something. Jordan Peele himself is passable as a host, he isn't captivating or anything but he is a highlight for the episode that's for sure. Overall, this episode was about as deep as a puddle and about as interesting to look at as one too, but I will admit that that would be an insult to puddles. There are some good bits but it's mostly surrounded by bitter and unsavory chunks that left a bad taste in my mouth.

My Thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

At first I wasn't sure how necessary it was to call this the Twilight Zone. It had a very different look to the original series, the direction was a little too fast paced, and it could have just been any other sci fi show. I am a big fan of Jordan Peele and Kumail Nanjiani so I withheld my judgement until the end of the episode. Boy am I glad I did. I thought Tracy Morgan was great and perfectly spooky/mysterious. Having him vaping rather than how every character smoked in the original was great. It also implies that he's a devil like character, a tool they would use a lot in the original e.g. The Printer's Devil. I understand why they used an hour long format, tv audiences today wouldn't just make the crazy logic leads with the show like they would back in the day, but I do wish they would have used a 30 min show and made it build a little quicker. Ultimately I thought that the ending was very reminiscent of the original series. The emotional high point was quite juicy and they didn't just ham fist it in. It felt like they earned the emotion of that scene. I thought Jordan did a better job at the intro and outro than any reboot so far.

Wiki Description 

&amp;#x200B;

Justin Sanderson is a reporter struggling from PTSD. While on a flight to Tel Aviv, he discovers an MP3 player with a podcast called Enigmatique hosted by Rodman Edwards. Sanderson quickly becomes unnerved by the show when it begins to accurately explain things that are happening on the flight and declares that the plane will crash. He takes comfort in a fellow passenger and former pilot named Joe Beaumont who seems to be the only person who believes him. Justin tries using clues from the show to avert the disaster, but every attempt in doing so results in irritated crew and passengers. Justin and Joe quickly work together to get the latter into the cockpit. They are successful only for Justin to realize that Joe is the one who will crash the plane due to past failures in his life and does so. Justin awakens on an island and learns through the show that all of the flight survived, but no one was able to find Justin himself. The survivors appear and kill Justin for ironically causing the crash.

174,"I was wondering why every single person on the plane survived the crash, and sure it works for the poetic ending when they all massacre the main guy. 

But then I thought about car crashes. Experts always say it’s better to get in a car crash where you don’t know it’s coming, so your body is limp, you aren’t trying to brace yourself for the impact. Everyone on the plane was put to sleep so their bodies would be lifeless in the crash. I also tend to believe that once our protagonist realizes the plain is going down, re removes his oxygen mask and gets knocked out as well so he wouldn’t have to live through the crash, that’s why he just wakes up on the beach (I would). 

Of course this doesn’t explain why nobody even has a scratch on them or why they didn’t drown, just an interesting thought. ",Claymationdude07,"(Spoiler) I have an explanation for part of the ending of 30,000 feet",1554400690,3,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-04

181,"Whilst I haven't done a very deep dive yet I have yet to see many interesting interpretations of what the first couple of episodes are about. I've seen a couple of people complain that they feel shirked by the feeling of a left wing agenda but I personally didn't feel this and wonder if this is down to Samir's Second Ammendment jokes.

To me, the first episode felt like an indictment of cancel culture. Samir's naming and shaming of his subjects causes their very existence to be entirely wiped out along with any impact they have had on the world. Whilst his first chosen subjects have done grave terrible acts such as drink driving and paedophilia, the crimes quickly slip into a grey area with his subjects' guilt being more questionable each time. To me Samir feels like the left wing media and by the end we come to realise that he is looking for anyone to talk about just to feed his hungry audience and he is definitely not the good guy. 

The second episode's message is less overt to me but something about an investigation ultimately over nothing and involving a Russian red herring definitely feels on the nose with regard to the Mueller investigation and the left's general paranoia over Trump. Perhaps more on the nose is the protagonist's article being called ""the end of civility.""

I'm familiar with the original series and watched my share of ""Black Mirror"" and ""Electric Dreams"", but I'm really enjoying the tone of the storytelling in this modern iteration/continuation of the classic, beloved series.

Watching media outside of its historical context is often tricky.  Is it fair to judge a piece of art for being cliche if it pioneered that cliche?  How much bearing should that have on my opinions?  I can sit here and pretend like it's all well and good and not something I've seen a million times before but that's disingenuous.  Now when I put on my reviewer hat I ought to be understanding of context but that's easier said than done.  Genies (Jinn) have been around for millennia.  They're intelligent, have crazy powers, and look real weird.  They can be your angles or yuor devils.  They're basically as unique and varied as humans but like, superhumans.  And as we all know, humans need to be kept on a leash, hence the whole bottle thing.  I think Solomon had like, hundreds of bottles in his genie cellar.  We can credit a lot of how we (the west!) see genies to Arabian Nights.  Now this episode seems to mostly be concerned with juxtaposing the genie with a fairly typical, relatable couple writhing in debt. I hold that this wasn't an original idea even for its time but it certainly paved the way for many bottles to come.  From primordial superhumans to Will Smith, this is another tale of another genie and the people he's messing with.  And yes, it's in the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Arthur Castle has to be like, the dumbest guy ever.  Top 10 Dumbest Twilight Zone Protags coming soon, to a sub near you.  Head of a foreign country, can't be voted out of office, within this century?  Dude, aren't you Jewish?  I don't think it's confirmed whether the character is Jewish but Luther Adler is and he does have a nice kvetch to his voice.  Even if I hadn't seen that Futurama parody this is beyond predictable.  I do think that if his character is Jewish it adds more horror to the twist but it also makes him like, really really dumb.  I get he's all caught up on the wish train but he's literally trying to make a wish that doesn't have consequences when the most obvious of all consequences is right under his nose (in a toothbrush mustache).  And apparently Adler's played Hitler twice before this, so it might even be an in-joke.  It's a strong twist in theory, but its sheer obviousness has it fall flat.  He totally deserves Genie's evil laughter.  Also it's clever that the genie's lamp subbed in for the cyanide bottle even though it's historically inaccurate.  That's the least of this episode's problems.

I like that Arthur and Edna Castle are genuinely good people.  Usually the way these stories play out is that the wishmaker (or wishee) is greedy and deserves to be punished for their selfish desires.  They get carried away but the beginning establishes that they're good people who are just trying to get by.  I don't blame them for wishing for a million dollars (which would go for 8 million today) or the power thing.  Edna does feel a little superfluous in all this - Arthur does all the wishing.  She's basically just there to doubt Arthur.  I guess technically Arthur owns the bottle but still.  I've always appreciated the Twilight Zone's minimalism, including casting but to have a character that basically does nothing in an episode with 3 major characters is disappointing.  But enough negativity - Arthur's generosity to Mrs. Gumley is heartwarming and it's a little weird that he gets punished for this.  Wait, no he doesn't.  Mental scars notwithstanding.  In fact, he gains something - he gets 5 bucks out of the deal and all of his poor friends get bundles of money.  I know he reset everything but the glass wasn't ""reset"" until he bumped into it.  You could suppose that all the money they donated will get magicked away somehow but they end up appreciating what little they have and it's still a happy ending, at least.  I also like the antique shop - given how minimal the settings usually are (especially in the next episode) it's nice to see a bunch of ornate statues and ceramics and such (I think I saw the Holy Grail somewhere).  It also cements the irony of being surrounded by this extravagant stuff while being on the verge of bankruptcy.  Also apparently some of the music here is re-used from What You Need.  Nice touch.

I love Joseph Ruskin in this.  He honestly makes the episode.  I like that the smoke coming out of the bottle at first is implied to be from Genie, because he sure drags that cig throughout the entire episode.  He comes off as a subdued salesman, like someone who acts formal with a vague hint of the sinister.  You can see a glimmer of amusement as he watches the Castles debate over what to wish for.  Look at how he beams when Arthur brings up power.  He knows he's got a couple of flies in his jaws but he'll savor every moment before his mouth snaps shut.  His magnanimous act is so convincing that you start to wonder if he's genuinely warning them about the inevitable consequences of magic - that is, until his face freezes in laughter at Arthur's boneheaded wish.  Luther Adler has a decent performance as well, if not a bit hammy.

The glass wish never backfires.  Maybe it's because it's so simple and innocuous but that's interesting, right?  It implies that maybe Genie isn't as evil as we thought and he'd be more than happy to grant small, meager wishes.  Or maybe he's luring them into a false sense of security.  Oh well, it's basically just a ""test wish"" anyways.  Guess that's why they get 4.  It's fun that they had a test wish for that suspension of disbelief and the gag time was pretty short.  And I guess Genie's glass-fixing abilities foreshadow him fixing his bottle, as if that was something we needed to see.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing about this episode is that it is predictable as all get-out.  It plays out exactly how you expect these wish episodes to go with little variation or subversion.  The twists are predictable too.  Even if it was more original in its day I still feel it's a weaker episode overall.  Maybe show it to somebody who's literally never seen this type of story ever.  The protagonists are likable enough and Ruskin's performance should keep you entertained.  Contemporary cultural context does put a damper on this one as it does to many classic episodes but this is one bottle I could do without.

I finally am starting to get more into production on this and have been brainstorming ideas for episodes.
One episode my cohost and I decided on was one entirely about Twilight Zone.

We were planning to discuss just how important the show was to film history and just how classic and timeless many of its episodes are.

But we were also hoping to pick 5 episodes to go over and give a brief “review” of and discuss. Originally I was going to pick just a few episodes I enjoyed a lot but I know for a fact I don’t know the show nearly as well as many of you likely so.

And to fit with our discussion better I decided to come here and ask you all, in your personal opinion what are the 5 most important and influential episodes of the original show?


Sorry if this post has gotten a little big. Thank you all for answering I really appreciate it.

Also, just so I don’t have to make another thread. What are good resources to research the show and Rod Serling? 

Obviously I can go to Wikipedia or something but I’d rather find more unique and for lack of a better word “better” sites/sources.
We really want to nail this episode of our show and do this incredible and influential show justice, so we want to do as much research, and learn as much as possible beforehand as we can.
So if you know of any fantastic sources please let me know.

Again, thank you so much.

20," Something I kinda love about the original Twilight Zone is just how early 60s it is. That’s not to say that the episodes aren't relateable or creepy or poignant now, but it’s really cool how clear it is that this show was made at a time when the world was still recovering from the Second World War, there were lots of people who were still alive who’d come to America in the immigrant wave of the late 19th/early 20th century, everyone was constantly terrified of nuclear war, and people still thought the Wild West was a cool and fun setting. Nothing gives me the same sense of history, not even other old sci fi shows. Both the original Star Trek and Classic Doctor Who have socio-political commentary (don’t let anyone tell you otherwise), but their protagonists are people who go to different places and have adventures, not various ordinary people who wind up in various fucked up circumstances. I really hope that Jordan Peele’s version of The Twilight Zone is able to stand the test of time and give people the same sense when they watch it 50 or 60 years from now. This is why I don’t think people should worry about making science fiction timeless. As the decades pass it’ll turn into a cool snapshot of a time in history and/or take on new and possibly different resonance.

34,"I'm dropping the Serling shtick.  I can't keep it up.  Basically the idea is that I saw some episodes of The Twilight Zone as a child and I want to revisit it.  It's an iconic piece of television and I like that it's episodic so I can skip around.  I was a dumb kid (""One for the Angels sucks.  It's not even scary!"") so I'll find something new even in rewatches.  Also I looked up all the twists on Wikipedia because I was a dumb kid.  Hopefully those stay buried.  I'll mostly be looking at the original 60's series but never say never.  It's worth mentioning I don't have Season 4 so we'll save our Jess-Belles and Printer's Devils for later.  Browsing through the catalog, one of the episodes that made a huge impression on me was Perchance to Dream.  I remember it being terrifying, and it had a cat in it which is always good.  But this cat's out of the bag and diving feet-first into... the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

It's still spooky.  Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statues and all that.  Even when people say they're silly and cheesy I can't help getting spooked.  But most of the spook comes from Robert Florey's directing - I'll have to get back to some of his other episodes.  According to Charles Beaumont, Florey strove for quality and ""\[this episode\] might have been the most expensive MGM feature.""  It shows.  Right at the beginning we trail along a low-angle shot of a building, making it look powerful and imposing.  After that we cut between Edward Hall's weary face and people cycling in and out of the building, emphasizing how nerve-wracking such a trivial task is for him.  It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity, like an opener should.  With how quick these cuts are I start to feel dizzy, there's a distinct sense of vertigo here.  In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written stories are capable of conveying more information than television.  That's obviously not true, and this episode serves as a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition, movement, and sound.  Granted I haven't read Beaumont's original story but I can't stress enough how great Florey's directing is here.

This episode plays with fear and paranoia and takes its sweet time to build up to Hall's serialized nightmares.  The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it's shot really makes me anxious.  Just like the beginning we flash between Hall's panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object - you gotta go back and wonder what Hall was seeing in the building and people going through it.  Seeing the infamous eyes for the first time isn't even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drives my heart rate up and the aftermath feels like an afterthought.  Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can't help it - and its consequences are all too real, whether as a car crash or death itself.

This idea continues as we enter Hall's dream.  In a way, a dream is just a form of Hall's imagination, only stronger and harder to escape.  When he talks to Maya for the first time she points out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it's only a dream, not realizing how much a dream can affect him.  It's not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thoughts without realizing how they're being consumed, or how others can wave off one's paranoid thoughts as something you can just think away.  Maya uses this to her advantage - it's only a dream, so why not indulge a little?  Not only into Hall's fears but also into the thrill of a funhouse, a rollercoaster, or even a courtesan.  Maya represents Hall's indulgence - whether it's into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear-view mirror.  An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence.  The idea isn't that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought.  The power of the mind is terrifying.

A low-key fear of mine is Maya's freakin' laughter.  It's there at the beginning of Hall's dream, it's there as Hall gets spooked by Maya and it's there as Hall enters and exits the funhouse.  Juxtaposing laughter with dark, unsettling imagery evokes not only that someone knows something you don't but also that they delight in your disorientation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's time to talk about my least favorite part of the episode - the twist.  This episode didn't happen.  Hall died 3 minutes into the episode, just after he entered Dr. Rathmann's office.  It's a real Playtest.  There's always something that bothers me about these kinds of twists - it cheapens the episode a bit, basically admitting to the audience that this was all a fat load of nothing.  This episode fares better than most because thematically it's deeply ingrained in dreams as a stronger vehicle of the imagination.  Although Hall's official cause of death is ""probably a heart attack"" we see that in his mind he commits suicide - he can't handle the idea that Maya has followed him to this safe space and fears that she's going to kill him so he ends up doing it for her.

So what's my beef with the twist?  So the idea is that Hall's imagination ends up consuming him - Hall sees someone who looks like Maya and it scares him so much that he jumps out the window.  But when this is revealed to be a dream, something is lost.  It's not like in Twenty-Two where Liz experiences the terror of seeing her dream play out in real life - it would work if that were the case because Hall's paranoid dreams create dissonance with reality - the painting isn't really moving.  There's nobody in the backseat.  Hall's imagination is superseding reality.  With the twist, Hall's imagination is only superseding his imagination.  He's imagined this scenario where the receptionist looks like Maya and it's too much for him.  Of course the ending reveals that the IRL receptionist, Miss Thomas, bears a striking resemblance to Maya but that's practically irrelevant.  His dream is only referencing itself.  There's no reality to ground it.  Who's to say that both Maya's appearance in the dream within a dream and the psychiatrist dream aren't both based off of Miss Thomas?  If Shadow Play is anything to go off of, Maya's appearance might change with every dream.  Her piercing eyes are her main feature.  And you could argue that the shock of seeing Maya is what drove his heart over the edge in real life, but they barely feel connected.  The powerful fear of becoming disconnected with reality is lost completely because dreaming is a normal, commonplace thing - you're not disconnecting from reality.  I actually like the set-up - Hall's dreams are affecting him IRL from the start - not in some tenuous physiological connection but because they're forcing him to stay awake. Some have said that this is a more realistic episode but this is the part that swerves into fantasy - the idea that the dream affected him so much it killed him.  You die in a dream, you die in real life.

So why even have the twist?  Some say that Beaumont is overly indulgent in twists and I can kinda see that - it's a little cheesy in Person or Persons Unknown and A Nice Place to Visit but we have other examples like Shadow Play and Long Live Walter Jameson that don't really have twists (though the ""twist"" to the latter is pretty weak).  The main two aspects of this twist are the ideas of imagination consuming Hall's life and the dissonance between reality and imagination.  What better way to show how powerful Hall's imagination has become by putting him fully into it, through a dream, and having that kill him?  Maybe I would've liked it more if he just had vivid hallucinations and ran around completely disorientated.  But the second part is the crux of the twist - in his dream, Hall dies violently and of his own accord - he jumps out of a window, signifying his heart giving out.  But he dies peacefully in real life, without nobody realizing the trauma he's gone through.  On the one hand, I like that the Twilight Zone is acknowledging that people see, think, and feel things differently and wants us to empathize more with others but this theme isn't developed well enough.  I don't hate the twist, but I think it's kind of lame and I wouldn't go to its birthday party.  I don't always like the subtle touch but the way it's used here is decent, just not in a way I can really get behind.  And I'm totally biased against this ""genre"" of twist so if you've made it this far, take this salt with a grain of twist.  Writing this out makes me appreciate the twist more.

&amp;#x200B;

Also John Larch, who played Mr. Fremont in It's a Good Life comes back (front) as Elliott Rathmann, the psychiatrist.  Total coincidence.  I like him a lot better here, as this wry understated psychiatrist that cracks jokes about not looking like Freud.  It's interesting that he offers Hall a smoke as even then the health effects are known - of course this is all Hall's dream so we don't actually know anything about the real Rathmann.  This was probably an excuse to get him towards the window.  In fact, what little we see of Rathmann shows him as a more concerned, active figure - maybe Hall thinks of him as this droll character to help calm him down.  When Hall is explaining his strong imagination, with every one of Rathmann's reassurances Hall immediately responds with ""I know.""  At no point does Rathmann challenge Hall or give him any new information.  Hall is talking to himself.  And the smoke ends up paralleling Maya giving him a light in his dream, signifying the false sense of calm preluding the very real danger he's in.  Clever.

Hall ends up being half-right in his paranoia - falling asleep does end up killing him but not in the way he expected.  He doesn't end up dreaming in serial, back to the carnival, but rather someplace as safe and prosaic as a psychiatrist's office.  It's one thing to find something spooky in a spooky carnival but in an ordinary office?  Shock city.  Overall, this is the kind of episode where you have to be right there with the protagonist to really enjoy it.  If you aren't relating to Hall, you could easily see this episode as slowly-paced and kind of boring.  He loses me a little near the end but this is easily one of the better ""psychological thriller"" episodes of the Twilight Zone.  And I know nobody will share my gripes with the twist, so all the more reason to check it out.  This is a dream you won't want to wake up from.  Also, I forgot to talk about Richard Conte and Suzanne Lloyd's performances.  They were good.

1. Something deadly happens to the main character Hyder Simpson within the first few minutes of this episode----he drowned in a lake running after his dog.
2. He returns the next morning and realizes that nobody's talking to him. He of course thinks he's being ignored and doesn't clue in it's because the living and dead aren't meant to interact-----they can't see or hear one another and have no clue that he's there.

3. He sees the people digging a grave for his dog Rip----\[RIP, Rest In Peace\] He tries to talk to them and later shoot them-----what would have happened if he pulled the trigger? Would just air and dust dissipate and nothing else? Or would have forfeited his chances for heaven altogether as he was trying to kill people----thou shalt not kill remember? 

4. He tries several times to talk to his wife, to no avail. It turns out Hyder Simpson and Rip are no longer alive at the very end and unable to go back to the land of the living.

5. Hyder follows the pall bearers bearing a coffin asking who's in it, but now he's mostly talking to his dog. Instead of finding the cemetery, he finds the other gate.

6. Hyder Simpson and his dog Rip died during the night, but neither knows it.

7. The episode ends with Hyder Simpson walking his dog up to heaven with him finally at peace having accepted that it is what it is, and he is dead and finished with life on earth. He's at peace and acceptance.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, Dr. Malcolm Crow from The Sixth Sense went through all of these same situations since the start of the movie The Sixth Sense. I know M Knight admitted that The Sixth Sense wasn't even his own idea, he stole the inspiration from Are You Afraid Of The Dark's Dream Girl, but yes the side by side comparison is uncanny and it fits with only a few minor infractions. Instead of almost---attempting to shoot people, Dr. Malcolm Crow actually breaks the glass on the door of his wife's jewelry store. Instead of seeing people digging a grave and grabbing coffins, Dr. Crow and Cole attend someone's funeral together. And Dr. Crow had no pets. 

And it is possible that Rip The Dog no offense to Cole The Kid, since Cole could see ghosts and dead people all the time, and knew Dr. Crow was dead all along through a variety of scenes without dialogue even though Dr. Crow didn't know he was dead and  it turned out, it was Cole's mission to help Dr. Crow move onto the other side with ease. Similarly, Rip could see right through the phony gates and Hyder didn't want to separate from him, and if he did, The Late Hyder Simpson would have ended up in hell instead of heaven and that was Rip's Mission, but then again, Cole had a pet dog of his own named Sebastian who seemed to have a sixth sense with haunted apartments as well.

And now I guess he goes to a lab and analyzes the mineral composition or whatever that is this review.  And I called it The Groan Zone.  What the heck is wrong with me.  Enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

I love Anthony Freemont.  I think he's a real fascinating character.  A lot of people write him off as the spoiled godlike dictator that everyone in Peaksville fears but I don't think that's totally fair.

In Jerome Bixby's original story we get to see more into Anthony's mind (as watchers of art, we have some level of mind-reading too).  Sometimes he goes into the grove and plays with the animals, bringing them nests and water and such.  At one point he cornfields (re: murders) a sleek, furry thing (ferret?) for thinking about attacking another li'l critter.  It's not out of malice, Anthony just doesn't realize that animals need to eat and they can't just expect him to materialize soy dogs or whatever.  Even when he forces a rat to eat itself, that's only because Aunt Amy doesn't like rats in the basement and he's trying to do her a favor.  He probably doesn't even realize he broke her brain.

We see some of this in Serling's adaptation as well.  It's clear he's framed more as a villain in the Twilight Zone, to bump up that spook factor.  Literally the first thing we learn about Anthony is that he's a monster.  But there's still a strange childishness to everything he does that lends a very particular brand of charm.  He makes a gopher with three heads and other funny animals.  On television night he has this little plastic dinosaur movie (with great effects too, if Odyssey of Flight 33 is anything to go off of).  He's doing the whole town a huge favor by making TV in a place without electricity.  And at some point he wonders why other kids won't play with him.  It's oddly isolating, having everybody constantly praise you and tell you how great everything is.

Basically, what I'm getting at is that Anthony is a child.  He might be an omniscient, omnipotent little mutant but he's still a child, darn it.  In the original story the fear doesn't just come from ""oh no he'll cornfield me"" so much as ""i don't know what he'll do"".  Even with good intentions he doesn't understand the full extent of his powers and how they affect people.  He likes Bill Soames.  But Bill's dog doesn't like him, so he'll just cornfield it.  And given how everyone's always enabling him, this is unlikely to change.  Rod points out one particular thing of note in the intro - he can feel every emotion.  The reason why he's so nice to the grove animals in the story is because it makes them feel good which makes him feel good.  You could even say he's an empath.  I suspect he doesn't feel a lot of genuine joy from people and has grown to expect this good fakey joy.  He might realize that something's not quite right but they seem happy and everyone reassures him how good he's being so he just rolls with it.  That's also why when he detects negative emotions he hones in on those and feels them strongly, even more so since everyone's trying to be happy all the time.

I really gotta hand it to Bill Mumy - he does a great job of creating this matter-of-fact god-emperor vibe.  Given how most child actors are he goes above and beyond to make Anthony feel smug and callous but in a way you kind of like.  He also has that thosuand-yard stare that adds to the spook factor.  He really makes the episode.  I'm glad he eventually got to go into space and build robots or whatever.  None of the other actors were terribly impressive, mostly because they're stuck on that hivemind of fear and fake smiles.  The only other characters with any semblance of personality are Aunt Amy and Dan Hollis.  Amy is a living example of how Anthony could mess up anyone, even his own family.  It's never clarified what he did to her but a vacant stare is brought up so you get the gist.  That might be why she seems less terrified of Anthony, having the audacity to complain about the heat.  During Dan's speech she reaches ever-so-slightly for a poker, implying she was thinking of stabbing the little brat but chickened out.  Even though she's not quite right, she expresses her resentment toward Anthony a little more bluntly.  Also the snow at the end is a big screw you to her, having commented on the weather earlier.  Dan's the guy who stands up to tyranny and gets gunned down immediately.  He seems petulant in a ""it's my party, i'll cry if i want to"" kind of way but the booze doesn't help.  On one hand it's like ""c'mon bro, you can't wait 'till you get home?  you've been living under this god for like six years, what's an hour or two?"" but don't forget they live in a subsistence economy.  In the story it was clear that everyone traded things around, and I don't think gramophones grow on trees.  It's implied that they'll all die eventually unless Anthony materializes some food (probably candy or something) and they can enjoy that.  In the story Dan is transformed into ""something like nothing anyone would have believed possible"".  The dan-in-the-box was all Twilight Zone.  It's the perfect balance of horrific yet childish.  We don't actually see it on screen, it's just the shadow with a brief cut to his face.  Just like how they didn't show the triplicate gopher, this is a smart touch not only because their special effects aren't great but they leave more to the imagination.  When I see that cartoonishly deranged rabbit puppet pop out of the hat in the 1983 movie I can't take anything seriously.  For what it's worth it's a funny scene filled with cheese, just not what I expected.  This also happens in the 2002 revival when old Anthony burns a hole through someone and sets them on fire.  That episode has its own share of problems but we'll leave that for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this was a real good episode that deserves its spotlight.  Some worldbuilding and the of the nuance of Anthony's character is lost from the original story but other things are added like Dan telling Anthony off that heighten the conflict and make for a more entertaining watch.  Moonglow was a good musical choice, leaving behind a nostalgic bitterness behind its cheery service.  If I'd been familiar with this I would've felt the absence of Doris Day's lovely voice.  Not a super deep one but it compels you with the fear of being subjugated by a fickle, omnipotent force to the point that you can't even have your own thoughts.  And the feeling of closeted entropy that permeates this episode is just wonderful.  Everything will rot.  Hurrah.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a random note but sometime around the end Mrs. Fremont calls Mr. Fremont ""dad"".  I can't tell if this was a mistake or if she just does this because he's Anthony's dad and the world revolves around Anthony.  His parents are never given names which is odd.  Don Keefer was great too.  I love how when he says the brandy is ""real good"" you can tell he's actually being genuine for the first time in a long time.  So uh, give this one a watch.  And read the original story too.  It's online.  For free!  And tell me if you want more of these.  Leave some comments, give your thoughts on the episode.  More to come.

Earl Hamner Jr, who wrote this episode as well as a hand full of other TZ episodes before going on to strike it rich with The Waltons.

Mr. Garretty and The Graves-Another John Dehner episode except this time its set at Happiness, Arizona in the wild west and he plays a soothsayer to the dearly departed? Maybe so maybe not.

He thinks it's odd, but thinks nothing of it. The next day, he comes home and finds the hand has extended to an arm. The next day, a shadowy creature is crawling out. The day after that, it's walking toward his house. Days pass, with the creature getting closer and closer, and the guy is losing his mind, freaking out about this thing. Finally, the creature walks up to his door, but the next day, it's no longer in the painting. The man hears the doorbell, opens the door, and gasps, and the camera fades to black.

I've been binge watching this wonderful show the past few days, and despite watching and enjoying this show all throughout my life, I hadn't really sat down and really given the writing my full attention. It is really mind blowing how well most of the episodes hold up and how relevant they still remain today, and how emotionally effective many of them are.

My favorite script has been that of ""Eye of the Beholder"", as well as the performance of the lead actress- her vocal acting some is incredible. However, one line from another episode really grabbed me with its beauty. The intro to the episode ""A Passage for Trumpet"":

""Joey Crown: musician with an odd, intense face, whose life is a quest for impossible things, like flowers in concrete, or like trying to pluck a note of music out of the air and put it under glass to treasure.""

I replayed that last line several times. I don't know what it is, but that music metaphor and how it was delivered are just so beautiful to me.

The episode itself also affected me quite a bit. For anyone who hasn't seen it, it is about a downtrodden trumpet player in NYC, struggling with alcoholism and becoming suicidal. As someone who has dealt with those feelings before, it felt like I was meant to watch it. I felt for Joey and enjoyed the message of the ep. Anyway, with that said:

2,"Even with a few awkward moments along the way, to me this is the most emotionally powerful episode of the show. From the beginning where the grandmother is clingy, possessive of Billy, as broadly as its played it still manages to convey the mix of creepiness, sadness, and vulnerability someone in her position provides. The fact Billy's parents refuse to explain to him what's happening to his grandmother establishes the theme of the episode (the denial of death) perfectly. The way that we never hear the grandmother's voice come through the toy phone Billy uses to speak to her is perfect in adding ambiguity to the episode that made it more resonant for me. We don't know what's on the other side, and not making it explicit is utterly appropriate. 

Phillip Abbot's ""If you love him, let him live"" monologue is the best moment of the show for me. It's where the hook of TZ at its best (ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances) comes most alive to me, because its possibly the most nakedly someone breaks down in the face of the potentially supernatural circumstances they find themselves in. It's a guy talking on a toy telephone to someone he shouldn't believe is there, it's so undignified and yet the moment is so committed to that I can tear up thinking about it. The insignificant things that he lists off that Billy will never experience if his potentially desperately lonely grandmother keeps tap into some really primal emotions for me. I can even fully imagine the grandmother as she lets go and feel some inkling of how painful that would be.  

By the end, it doesn't even feel like it's a story about ghosts and the supernatural. It's about confronting and accepting the loss of loved ones, reaffirming life even in the face of the inevitable death we don't want to confront. Even shot on ugly video, it's so beautiful.

1,"If you bothered coming to this subreddit, you probably know that the whole reason Serling started appearing on camera for intros and outros from the second season on was that it got a good reception when he did it at the end of the final first season episode A World of His Own. 

I'm surprised they didn't try to finish off Season 5 with an episode where they do something where Serling goes from being effectively the host to a character in the show. They give some sort of hint why he's able to appear unnoticed in these stories, why he brings the Twilight Zone with him, etc. It feels like it could be equally well played for horror or laughs. 

It's not like it would have been too unusual at the time, since Jack Benny's program had been pretty popular for awhile and it was a meta-show. 

I know by then they were sort of running on fumes, but even if they bungled it the idea seems like it would have made for a memorable episode anyway. ",DoubleTFan,A meta-episode I'm surprised they didn't do,1549071793,1,True,TwilightZone,2019-02-01

For this, myself and many others feel this is one of the best episodes turning the focus from the supernatural to the frightening reality of the cold war. 

Unfortunately, what ruins it is the fact that the ending shows that there ARE aliens manipulating everything meaning that while they were targeting the wrong people, they weren't wrong and their initial suspension was correct.

1. First there's the original----well done, twilight zone with pig people and a beautiful face under bandages-----making for a compelling plot about loving all people. It could be looked at as a case of discrimination.
2. SNL: I don't know whether or not anyone remembers or if it should count or not as canon since it was just a sketch and a spoof, but Pamela Anderson did it. She was the girl under the bandages and we got a chance to see what the pig masks look like in color-----they take off the bandages to reveal Pamela Anderson but instead of being put off and horrified, all the male doctors fall in love with her and the female doctors look around and say, ""What's going on? I don't get it, what's happening?"" I can't forget this qoute: ""It'll be hard for me to go home to my pig-faced wife after seeing her!""
3. 2002----Twilight Zone. Same title, same name, different host Forest Whitaker. This is awkward to say the least. No pig masks, no pig people, no pigmayllion. Maybe this episode was to help Forest Whitaker through his disability, but it's insensitive to people who actually have suffered a stroke.

Someone suggested 'Time Enough at Last' as well.

  Personally, I think 'It's a Good Life' would make the best movie.  Unlike other Twilight Zone episodes, the conflict isn't resolved at the end.  Anthony is still able to terrorize Peaksville, Ohio with his powers.  That's why I think a movie could be able to expand on that, another hour-plus of Anthony causing mischief and the people of Peaksville trying to create a plan to stop him.

Nobody except Bolie can recall how the fight began, I guess if Henry went ahead and asked the opponent what really happened and what his recollection was it would open a plot hole, but that's neither here nor there when he tried to tamper with Henry's freewill by  telling Henry that he's too old to believe in magic----let Henry believe as he chooses Bolie!

Clearly, do the people who take to forums and complain that the beauty queen was homely and unattractive-----Did they miss the episodes Eye Of The Beholder and Number 12 Looks Just Like You? Enough said with that analogy, and who's to say that someone else's definition of beauty is wrong? How do we know that the astronaut who was complimenting her and her Plain Jane librarian looks doesn't actually like his girls homely and unattractive? Not everybody is attracted to supermodels some like their women to be on the plain side and others like women who are ugly.

Now obviously, the girl in beauty queen segment always wanted to be beautiful when she was alive, didn't happen, couldn't afford plastic surgery so she stipulated in her will that she be placed on display winning a Miss America competition while her more beautiful contestants lose and look on in envy. So what's wrong with that?

Who was the mayor anyways? We know he wasn't even really a mayor, official or a person in charge of anything. What was he like when he was alive and isn't his story worth telling?

Why not ask to be president, or a king, or a sultan? How badly was he bullied in life and did he ever lash out?

So the plot goes like this.

A kid is playing with a Morse code set in his bedroom. His mum comes in and goes, ‘Stop playing with that shit and come to dinner’.

He goes all bleary-eyed and says he just wants to contact his dad. His mum tells him to stop being a wanker and he knows his dad died in a naval battle intercepting some kind of Nazi Invasion fleet. The kid says he knows, but he’s still going to try.

He taps away at the Morse code set and twilight zone shit happens and the ship starts responding. He tells his father’s long-sunk ship to divert to avoid the Nazi fleet.

In what could only be described as an extreme breach of radio protocol his father’s ship acknowledges the message from a young boy in the future and changes its course. 

Then there’s a knock at the door and his dad comes in.

The kid is all like ‘dad you’re alive!’ And he says ‘of course I’m alive come to dinner FFS’ and the kid is really happy. The kid puts away the Morse code set and runs to dinner and FINDS NAZI SHIT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE HE HAS CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY AND THE NAZIS TOOK OVER.

5,"So in this hypothetical situation, you would be transported to the setting in the episode that your character appears in.

You can choose to play out the entire episode, or just certain scenes from it. However, everything that occurs in the episode also happens to you, there’s no changing anything to your added benefit.

You can also choose to leave the episode setting and return to your normal life at any time.

Which character would you like to experience being for a short time?

I would personally choose Henry J Fate from “Mr Denton on Doomsday”. You get to help out a down on his luck Al Denton and having access to all those potions and tonics seems cool.

Other fun choices to me are Gabriel from “A Passage for Trumpet” (being an angel and a great musician), Frisby (coming up with crazy stories and actually being abducted by aliens), and Gregory West (being able to make anything come to life by describing it).

Mute is especially bad. The first 2 minutes were cut the last time I saw it. This is where the parents are sitting around a table, discussing the idea of raising a child without communication. It explains the whole point of the episode, but if it’s cut, how would the viewer know that?

I also believe the Midnight Sun had the scene where Mrs Brunson collapses to the floor and dies from heat stroke cut from the episode.

I bought every book that I could find in hopes to dig deeper into his Radio Catalog, his Teleplay Catalog, etc. then His films beyond Planet of the Apes, Seven Days in May, etc - then there’s a book out just recently Rod Serling: His Life, His Work, His Imagination - and boy, oh boy is this pretty darn close to having his fully body of work, it’s 500+ pages but it isn’t intimidating at all, it’s a clean and smooth read, with synopsis of nearly everything else ever committed to the page. (And TZ only covers 1/5 of the pages in this book) I urge folks in this sub to pick it up - 

reading over my post this does seem like an ad but it’s not, I promise, I just really love this mans work a lot of writers talk about their mission to write about the human condition but rods work really nails it, and it’s a crime that his work isn’t more readily available for the masses, because all of it is still relevant today it still speaks to those who think themselves as the obsolete-man, The disenchanted, the lonely, the brave, the bold, the strange, the beautiful and the weird... his work is parables not of his time but our time...

 I hope that the more folks pick this up, the more it will show his estate that there is an interest in Rod’s work beyond that middle ground between light and shadow, beyond that pit of mans fears and above that summit of knowledge, that dimension of imagination and that area which we call the Twilight Zone.

13,"This is an episode from Season 4. I can say it's bad. Really bad. Before you read my analysis, go watch it. I'm not going to explain the plot, because I don't understand the plot. I'll give you a quick summary. One guy stops for gas in a small town that's guarding the secret of magical alien technology that can do essentially anything, and they detain him because he knows their secret. That's it. Let me say why it's bad.

The characters make bad decisions. Say everyone in your town has some magical Alien technology, and you're trying to keep it secret. What's the best way to keep a secret like that? This town has a completely OPEN ROAD leading into it. They simply assume that, due to their remote location, NOBODY will ever wander in and stop for gas or food. Is this stupid? Yes. It is established that these people can produce any food they want, any objects they want. They have no lack of resources, and nobody ever leaves, they're perfectly content. SO WHY DO THEY HAVE AN UNGUARDED ENTRANCE INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD? This would make sense: Put a log in the middle of the road, or a big rock, so people can't drive through, and a sign that says ""Road Closed"". Not their big giant magical invisible forcefield, as this would arouse suspicion, but just a barrier that makes it seem like there's nothing notable back there. Chances are they could just fade into obscurity like that. But they have a SIGN right outside! This is like if Area 51 had a day where you could come in and take all the pictures of aliens you wanted. These people are so bad at keeping a secret- and then, they imprison this guy just because he happened to pick out their town at random!

But it goes even farther than that. When he first gets to the town, this kid uses her magical alien technology to make the guy's dog disappear. The guy wonders how his dog disappeared, and he sees the kid playing with the techno-thingy, but her dad, the gas station attendant, says it's just her radio, and then she makes his dog come back. Now, this seems like a reasonable excuse. The guy assumes that maybe his dog just ran off somewhere for a minute, and maybe it is just a radio. So he drives off. THIS IS A SMART CHOICE. By this point, the guy doesn't care. He has his gas, and his dog. If the townspeople just let him go, he WOULD NOT CARE or think about visiting this town EVER AGAIN. He's a newspaper reporter, but he wouldn't report his dog running away in some little town. Seems like the townspeople have managed to keep their secret, right?

NOPE! They raise their HUGE INVISIBLE FORCE-FIELD, and his car literally CRASHES INTO NOTHING, then his dog DIES, then the townspeople bring his dog BACK TO LIFE. These people do not want to be thought of as normal, or hide a secret. This is clear. They want to be as bizarre as possible. This is the only thing I can conceive of. Are they idiots?

Dorn, the mayor, states in the episode, that they're not really evil, they just want to keep their secret. They don't want to keep him there, but they have to, in order to keep their secret. But he says he's a prominent reporter, and people will come looking for him. Won't they? Yes, they will. Dorn calls it the best kept secret in the world. Is it? Is it really? You leave your town wide open, you act insane, and you're so obviously hiding something. These people just want to stand out. They can't sorta want to hide their secret but also keep an open connection to the outside world. It's one or the other. 

The town has a hotel, and a restaurant, but they're not real! The hotel is supposedly ""completely booked,"" but all the guests are out, and the restaurant is ALWAYS CLOSED. Why does the gas station work, then? Why would these people need gas if they never go anywhere and can have all the food they want? Does this town NEED all these totally fake businesses everywhere to make their town seem more ""normal?"" It would seem more normal to have NO restaurant or hotel than to have restaurants and hotels that ARE FAKE. Some towns have no restaurants or hotels. They could just tell him, ""we don't have a restaurant or a hotel, so you'll have to go somewhere else."" He'd leave. Easy.

But that isn't the worst part. The worst part is, at the end of the episode, THEY REALIZE THAT THEY CAN JUST ERASE HIS MEMORY with their technology, and restore everything back to normal, so he won't know what's happened. This renders all the prior conflict completely pointless. Also, we're supposed to feel sad that he doesn't know the lady anymore. It would be sad if she was his wife BEFORE he entered the town, and she had to stay there. I'm not invested in their romance. He's just some random guy, and she's just some random lady, and she betrayed him anyway, and if they go their separate ways, then so what? It's a happy ending. 

Overall, this episode is bad. Serling and Co. really struck out with this one. Twilight Zone episodes are good when he characters do believable things. We cheer on the people when they leave Pall's imaginary apocalypse, we praise Templeton when he decides to pursue his passion, we identify with the guy who's alone with nobody but his reflection to speak with. Those are good episodes. This episode is bad because nobody does anything that makes sense. It could be good if it was executed properly, like if the townspeople really did try to keep their technology a secret and did everything in their power to help this poor guy escape. 

Dorn says that the last time anybody wandered in, it was 1953. What happened to that guy? Did they turn his car into Spaghetti-Os and then tell him nothing was bizarre? ",Iamnotthethe,Valley Of The Shadows sucks.,1543255448,12,True,TwilightZone,2018-11-26

**Opening Narration**

*The prostrate form of Mr. David Ellington, scholar, seeker of truth and, regrettably, finder of truth.

The wife had a bad night of sleep and woke me up at about 2am the day before Halloween about two weeks ago, and you know how you remember dreams clearly if you wake up suddenly? That happened to me. 

Here’s the weird part, my dream was a complete, full-length, black-and-white version of the 1960s Twilight Zone. Not a dream about an episode that I’ve seen, but rather a brand-new episode concocted entirely by my subconscious. Almost right away the next morning I started telling people about it and my wife in particular encouraged me to write it down.

I didn’t wake up in the middle of the episode and decided to finish it, I dreamt the whole damn thing start to finish. And was woken up at the exact moment it ended.

My dream had Nazis in it. I’m going to write about Nazis. f you think for a minute I condone Nazis or hate you are dead wrong – and I think my values are pretty well reflected by my dream. Before you react to this post please read to the very end. If you are a Nazi or a racist and you feel a need to reply, don’t. I’ll ignore you and your dead ideology. 

They say men don’t dream dialogue but women do. I can’t say either way. I don’t recall distinct words or conversations, just mostly thoughts, scenes, and concepts. I did embellish my dream with the opening and closing narratives Rod Serling-style that matches my impression in the dream of knowing the setting and implications of the story. I also made up a title to match my dream.

I’ve also heard that men dream in black and white. Not too sure about that since I’ve had colorful dreams. This dream though was completely black and white, just like the old Twilight Zone series. 

I don’t think a story like this would hold up today. But, compared to Twilight Zone episodes (which I’ve since researched – I never saw them before my dream) like “Death’s Head Revisited,” and “He’s Alive,” I think it holds up pretty well. I have seen plenty of Star Trek stories with Nazis in them. This story is similar to Man in a High Castle but not in a contemporary sense, everyone in my dream really talked and acted like they did in the original Twilight Zone.
 
I’m also not a writer, I’m an engineer. I have no idea how to write a screenplay. So, I’ll write this as an outline like a Wikipedia episode summary.
 
Oh, and I apologize this isn’t a particularly scary Twilight Zone, even though I dreamt it up pretty close to Halloween. 
Here it goes:
“Living History” Opening Scene: An outdoor museum similar to Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, with wood fencing, horses, and people in costumes, and school children bustling about. But the cameras pull back and reveal tanks, Nazi flags, soldiers, and statues. Visitors, children, and staff alike wearing Nazi armbands.
Opening Narration: “Picture an America, a lovely field in Pennsylvania, but not an America or the Pennsylvania we know today. No, this America succumbed to the Nazi hordes in the Second World War, and now lives as a subjugated people of the far larger empire of the Third Reich, and the bitter memories of this war have long faded. In this America lies a museum, a living history museum on the site of the last battle of that conflict where her last hope was extinguished. The visitors to this museum come from far and wide to learn about the Master Race’s victory over the feeble democracy-loving Allies. What the visitors, workers, and administrators of this museum will soon come to find out, some candles and flames cannot be so easily extinguished…in the Twilight Zone.”
Plot Summary: The museum is in full swing on a busy day. Located somewhere in Pennsylvania, the staff put on a show for visitors like a living history museum. There are horse rides, tanks, fake uniforms, and weapons, and a few old-fashioned wood fences near some WWII trenches. 
There is even a pit where Nazi children can come and stomp on an American Flag, and several are there stomping away with many more lined up behind them.
[note: no it kind of doesn’t make sense that a horse would be in a WWII museum, but there was definitely a horse in my dream and played a big role.]
The museum staff is quite large with quite a few workers but the Nazi administrators are pretty bored and disinterested, except when they are giving orders. The museum really isn’t being run all that well, Nazis clearly looking forward to the future and not spending much time keeping the place up. The horse ride is a disaster, the road to the museum is a mess, and the place is generally completely run down.
Our story starts with a person I felt was an Affable American Loser. He didn’t get a name in my dream, so I’ll call him “AL” for short. He is the youngest and lowliest member of the staff, in charge of horse rides. When the supervisors aren’t around he makes all sorts of jokes with his fellow staff, who advise him to keep it down or else he’ll get in trouble.
A Nazi Supervisor, an American but in a Nazi uniform, is dressing him down for not following orders to give all the children rides before the day is over. He complains that the horse is overworked, and hasn’t had enough hay and water. 
The Nazi supervisor isn’t having it. He becomes outraged, denies Al’s request for more hay and water, and insists that he fills his ride quota as ordered. He explains (or shouts) that he has been ordered to maintain the museum in an orderly and efficient manner in accordance with the tenets of National Socialism. There is a grand inspection tomorrow evening, and he insists everything be working at peak efficiency – or else. With that, he stomps off.
That evening, when putting the horse away, Al gets separated from his other workers and discovers a back door to the prop and supply room, normally off limits. He pauses to admire a Nazi general’s uniform. In the supply room he finds a basket of apples and secrets them out near the kid’s horse ride area.
The next day Al has his horse ride operation running at peak efficiency, thanks to the apples he is secretly feeding his horse. The Nazi Supervisor comes by and notes the better operation. He still holds a grudge from yesterday’s debacle, and moves on without acknowledging Al’s work. After he leaves a messenger arrives with a message for the Nazi Supervisor. The messenger states that the head Nazi General administrator has been delayed for several days. Al, being mischievous, tells the messenger he’s a trusted senior member of the museum staff and he’ll convey the message personally to the Supervisor. The messenger leaves, and Al pulls an apple out of his pocket, starts juggling it in the air, and whistles. He clearly isn’t going to deliver the message.
That evening, Al sneaks back into the prop room to get more apples. On his way out he again admires the general’s uniform – this time he decides to try it on. After putting on a fake mustache and monocle, his is nearly completely indistinguishable from his former self.
But, as he is putting on his last goose-stepping boot he leans up against a wall – that turns out to be a door to a conference room!
Straightening up he sees the Museum and local Nazi administrators all lined up at a conference table. Seeing him they snap to attention and salute – “Heil Hitler!”
After a few stunned moments Al realizes he needs to fake his way out of this situation. He decides to vent his frustration of working at the museum.
[Note: Al fakes a pretty good German accent. I just can’t write one that well.]
“You call this a museum? Look at this place! The attractions are barely functional, the staff lazy, this place is a mess, and the road coming in is a disaster! This place is a disgrace to National Socialism! I order that the roads repaired immediately, animals fed, clean-up crews established, etc. etc. I order you to make this place run like a well-oiled Nazi machine!”
The Supervisor sputters, “but…sir, we have not been ordered before to do any of these things.”
The ‘General’ replies, “Well, YOU’VE BEEN ORDERED NOW! THINK OF WAYS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND GET TO WORK!” After a few moments of stunned silence, Al says “DISMISSED!”
At that word, the Nazis in the conference room scramble out the door to enact the fake General’s orders. Al waits just a bit, then hurries back to the prop room to change back as fast as he can. He emerges to find the Supervisor barking orders at the museum staff, empowering them to make as many changes as possible. 
Al comes out of the prop room just in time. The Supervisor starts to chastise him for not being at his duty station, but the horse comes by with a happy child on its back. The Supervisor leaves without another note. Some of Al’s fellow museum workers give him knowing glances, showing that some of them likely know about Al’s biggest trick ever.
A key beat is when the Supervisor insists that the museum staff think for themselves making the museum run more efficiently. The Supervisor pauses for just a moment, not quite understanding the implications of what he is ordering people to do.
Flash forward a few days, the museum is running at its highest efficiency ever. The road is fixed, people are very happy to be there, and the trash is picked up. A visible transformation has occurred. Al has become a leader of this effort, and the Nazi American Supervisor has grown to appreciate him.
At the museum’s conference room, the gathered Administrators, which now include Al himself, are congratulating themselves and discussing at great length what else could be fixed. Having gotten the museum up and running smoothly they are looking at their surrounding towns and villages and start making suggestions how to fix them, like getting trains and buses running on time to allow more visitors to the museum.
Just then, the real German Nazi General shows up. After the usual saluting and “Heil Hitler”-ing, the General launches into a tirade.
“JUST WHAT IS GOING ON? WHO GAVE THE ORDERS TO USE RESOURCES TO FIX THE MUSEUM!?” and so on. The Nazi American Supervisor speaks up hesitantly, “Sir…we were just following orders to make this museum run as efficiently as –“ He gets cut off.
“WHO AUTHORIZED YOU TO MAKE THESE CHANGES?! HOW DARE YOU WORK WITHOUT PROPER ORDERS! YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING PROPER NATIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES” and he really starts sputtering accusations. The assembled Administrators glare at the General. [You know, in the way they always seemed to do in the old Twlight Zone show. That kind of long 60’s glare that would be edited down to 0.02 seconds in a modern TV show, with the horns blaring] 
The Nazi American Supervisor grows a backbone, maybe for the first time ever. “No sir, you are wrong. We are following proper National Socialist values. It is you who are out of line. Guards, please take the General to the Officer’s quarters and hold him there.” They do so, the General sputtering the whole way.
The Supervisor turns to his administrative staff. After a moment of careful consideration, he speaks.
“Gentlemen, I believe what we have learned here at this museum can be a great benefit to the people of the Third Reich. There are many inefficiencies of how our Government runs. How do we best spread our techniques to the larger country?”
After a rapid discussion, the gathered Administrators come to an astonishing conclusion. They realize they must take charge of the weapons at the museum, bring them back into service, and seize the local burgermeister’s office. Then they will be able to implement changes to the trains, bus line, food supplies, quality of life, etc. The Administrators are absolutely convinced they are acting in the best interests of National Socialism, and all excitedly rush to action. 
A revolution has started.
But a small detail comes up as they are rushing to exit the museum. Someone calls out, “how will we distinguish ourselves from the Nazis who have lost their way?” Some discussion ensues. Everyone wears the Nazi armband, and everyone has the same uniforms and Nazi flags.
Then Al, standing near the back, is lightning struck by an idea. He rushes over to the flag-stomping pit and reaches down…for the American flag.
As he grasps the staff of the tattered, torn, and beat-up stars and stripes, the museum workers and supervisors all gather around and look up to it. 
Just starting to comprehend that they haven’t been acting in the best interests of National Socialism.
They’ve been acting in the interests of…something else
…something that has been forgotten for far too long. A faint music plays, a memory of…
-SCENE-
Closing Narration: “The gathered people and staff don’t quite comprehend what a profound transformation has happened in their humble, worn-down, and nearly forgotten museum. Seeking to enact a more perfect form of National Socialism, they have learned it’s basic, intrinsic flaw. Human initiative and thought are incompatible with a system that demands strict obedience to orders above all else. From this modest spark, a great fire of freedom has been kindled. For the self-evident truths of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness are just as self-evident, and just as true, even in the darkest corners…of the Twilight Zone.”",Ace76inDC,"One Year Ago Tonight, I Dreamt a Full, Complete, Original Episode of the 1960s Twilight Zone",1540951384,8,True,TwilightZone,2018-10-30

15,"So I’ve been trying to find an episode of the show for YEARS now and I’m not too sure if it exists, all I know is the plot synopsis.
I remember being in seventh grade and doing public speaking presentations. My friend’s, though, was by far my favorite and at the end he mentioned it was adapted to short story format from an episode of The Twilight Zone. Again, I’ve been trying to find it since.

Here’s the story:
Once (possibly in a small town) a streak of light is seen shooting over the sky and I think lands somewhere near where the people live. Everybody’s freaked out and wants to know what’s happening but they believe it to be an alien spaceship (now I might’ve completely misremembered that part but I remember people thinking aliens were present).

I can’t remember why but the people begin to panic, possibly because of fear of invasion. In the panic a small boy calls everyone’s attention and announces it IS aliens but the aliens can take the form of human beings, as was seen in his comic book.

-Now this part I might’ve just imagined now or just now remembered, I’m not sure:

One man in the crowd says that’s ridiculous but the others in the crowd start to accuse him saying that’s what an alien would say. Some others in the crowd I think start to say similar things or start accusing others of being aliens disguised as humans. This, in turn, breaks everybody’s trust in each other.

-Now if that last part was all imagined, this is probably what happened instead (though I think the first one was right):
The people, so desperately searching for answers, take what the boy says and begin to silently lose trust in one another...

I think the boys comic book does say something about aliens invading (and that might be where the fear sparks from). But also about them killing/eating/exterminating the human race (maybe).

Eventually people start to turn. Friends on friends, neighbors on neighbors, I think families on families. Nobody trusts anyone and they all start fighting. A big war/battle/fight ensues and people have lost all mercy. Friendships become rivalries, families become strangers, and mankind (at least in this area) has become a community of executioners (I believe).

At the end, it’s revealed to the audience that the aliens never invaded, but scared the humans into thinking so – as they knew this would, in turn, cause mankind destroy itself.",MikeWjr,Can anybody help me find if this episode exists?,1541366648,8,True,TwilightZone,2018-11-04

So, I'm going to be doing a rhetorical analysis of the original Twilight Zone series. I'm going to be analyzing the attitudes towards specific themes presented in the show (i.e. atomic war, mental insanity, cultural conformity, etc.) using the Burkean Pentad to determine what their driving motives are (Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, or Purpose). 

Anyway, I was wondering if y'all could help me out in one of two ways.

A) I am trying to decided on which themes and shows I am going to analyze. I know I am definitely going to be looking at the theme of Perceptions of Insanity (Perchance to Dream, 22, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet) as well as Cultural Conformity (Number 12 Looks Just Like You, Eye Of The Beholder). If anyone has any more suggestions for themes and corresponding shows, that would be great. I've been trying to re-watch some of them to make my decisions, but I just don't have the time at the moment. (If you mention your favorite episode, I'll try and include it)

B) At the moment I am supposed to be finding general papers about my topic. I am having issues finding credible academic journal/book sources on the Twilight Zone. If anyone just happens to know about one off the top of your head, could you please send it my way? :)

8,"There are lots of good brain puzzlers in the Original Series. Episode 2 of Season 3, for instance, The Arrival, even goes so far as to declare itself a mind-bending puzzle and says that paradoxes are the National Pastime in The Twilight Zone. Interesting statistic- I knew it probably wasn't baseball. There are other ones with good twists that you have to figure out- Five Characters, After Hours, and so on. Today, I'll be talking about ""Death Ship,"" an episode from Season 4, which, although bloated at an hour's length like most Season 4 episodes, is a good brain teaser nonetheless. Spoiler Alert.

This is the premise: Three astronauts land on a planet. One of them just so happens to be Jack Klugman. I know he has a name in the episode, but from here on out I'll refer to him as Jack Klugman, because he can't play anybody except Jack Klugman. Anyway, they see another ship outside, that's wrecked. They go inside, and see their own corpses lying on the floor. From there, they go into a form of hysteria. The two astronauts who aren't Jack Klugman experience vivid hallucinations where they find themselves back on Earth. Meanwhile, Jack Klugman tries to figure out what's going on, and why there's a ship outside with their bodies in it. He comes up with three possible theories throughout the course of the episode:

1. The ship outside is a manifestation of a possible future which may or may not happen. 
2. There are invisible aliens on the planet who don't like trespassers and are creating an illusion so they'll go away.
3. They're dead, they're ghosts, and the ship outside has their real bodies. 

By the end of the episode, option 3 seems the most plausible, since the ship outside just won't go away. The two astronauts who aren't Jack Klugman break down, ask him to let them die and rest in peace, and Jack Klugman, being a logical sort, insists that there must be some scientific explanation, and tells them that he'll keep looking for some explanation which clearly must not exist. Overall, it's an interesting and feasible blend of the supernatural and rational, and a captivating examination of the conflict between Logic and Religion.

By the end of the episode, it seems as if solution 3 has won out, and they're screwed. But let's assume that solution number one is true for a moment- Jack Klugman's theory holds that the ship outside shows what may or may not happen, depending on the choices they make, etc. This is by far the least threatening of the three- since almost any future is possible at any moment based on the choices we make. There are quintillions of alternate universes out there, where you jump out of you car door at a certain second of the day. Now picture this- the ship outside doesn't have a bush in it. All they would have to do, to avoid the probable future outside, would be to change or alter something in their immediate vicinity.

2,"The show seems to tick all the boxes for what I’d like to see. An anthology of mysterious stories all with a twist, I love that stuff.

But I have a weird phobia, throughout my life, of ‘dummies’. Let me explain, in any old 50’s or 60’s movies if a person or creature was represented with practical effects, I’ve never knew why, but it gives me the creeps and I have to turn it off. There’s rare occasions where it’s done well like the movie The Thing, or Yoda in the Star Wars movies or Child’s Play, but in movies like Them! And War of the Worlds when the creatures are clearly puppets, I don’t know why it just really makes my skin crawl, same whenever humans are represented the same way.

For example, I’ve heard of a Twilight Zone episode called “The Invaders” and that two small human figures get out of a very small airship, and I can’t watch that episode because I know those little figures will be toys or puppets.

For example, I enjoy Once Upon a Time, and Black Leather Jackets.

I find Once Upon a Time to be comic relief, and the episode plays out like a Three Stooges skit. I also genuinely enjoy the old subtitles and silent film aspect in the opening and ending scenes.

I like Black Leathet Jackets, the same way you would enjoy your cheesy sci fi movie. It’s meant to be quirky and offbeat. It reminds me of the low budget “B” horror/sci fi movies that premiered in the 50’s and 60’s.

I am 30 and always had a taste for the macabre, growing up with horror/children's horror in the 90s. 

I discovered TZ by letting Sci-Fi keep on playing after *Tales from the Crypt* had went off. I was already drawn to black and white television, as Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite played a lot of black and white. 

Not only was the ""draw"" of the show the eeriness and creepiness that ensued, but I really became drawn in from the beautiful writing. There's was always a lesson to be learned. There was always a ""moral"" to the story. This resonated with me deeply and made me appreciative.

*Twilight Zone* still remains my favorite television show of all time and definitely do not feel like that will ever change.

I think he is drunk and falls asleep so the other guys decide to kill him and take the money. I believe they throw him off a bridge.

The men think they have got away with it, until the man comes back into the bar as if nothing happened. I think it was implied he was the devil?

8,"I recently started watching The Twilight Zone again and was wondering if what others had as their top 5/10 episodes (hoping it makes a good list of what to watch for others interested.) Here is a list of my top 10 episodes and why I like them. I will try not to spoil much in my reasons. That is why a lot of my descriptions will seem really vague but it’s best for new viewers to experience a lot of these episodes unspoiled. 
Number 10) *I shot an Arrow into the air.* 
Pay attention to the details in this episode and you will really enjoy or see the Twist coming a mile away. Either way, it’s a solid story about astronauts dealing with being stranded. 
Number 9) *Deaths Head Revisited*: An episode where an ex-Nazi revisits a camp he was once in charge of in the Twilight Zone? Yeah this is not going to be pleasant. This is the first Twilight Zone I watched and damn is this dark. When the main character is enjoying his sadistic memories of his contributions to the Holocaust things go very wrong. Deaths Head Revisited is Terrifying.
Number 8) *The Old man in the Cave:* “God creates dinosaurs, God kills dinosaurs, God creates Man and Man creates dinosaurs.” This quote is what I think of when I watch TOMITC. The people in this post-apocalyptic town are happy to obey their God while it is working, but as soon as a new man arrives then offers them booze and tells them they can eat whatever they want they cast their God out. There is a very sad, but strong message here which, to me, is about how people can throw away survival for a chance at comfort. 
Number 7) *The Encounter*: A young Japanese-American man is locked in an addicted with an intoxicated WWII Pacific Vet. This episode gets better and better when the characters reveal more about themselves and what they are really hiding from one another.  

Number 6) *To Serve Man:* This is one of those iconic episodes that is comparable to a 25 minute long movie that leaves your jaw dropped at the end. Fantastic acting and effects with a great plot are what to expect watching this episode. 
Number 5) *The Hitch-Hiker:* Damn is this episode creepy. A woman is stalked by a mysterious hitch-hiker along her road trip. “Going my way?” No thanks. If you enjoy a thriller/mystery this episode is for you. 
Number 4) *The Monsters are due on Maple Street:* Imagine the paranoia you would feel if you found out there could be an alien in your street? Would you be rational or take action early? This episode is a great study on mob mentality and how easy it is for society is to collapse. 
Number 3) *Nightmare at 20 000 feet:* Even if you haven’t seen the Twilight Zone, you know the plot of this episode. Watching this character unfold and turn against the other people on the plane, where you alone with him question what he is seeing. Then having a big gut punch hit you right at the end. This is Twilight Zone at its best. 
Number 2) *Judgement Night:* “Stuck in my own personal Hell” has never had more of a meaning than this episode. Judgement Night and Deaths Head Revisited are two of the creepiest episodes of the Twilight Zone. The whole episode you have this sense of Dredd as an invisible clock is ticking down and wonder what happens when it hits zero.  
Number 1) *Five Characters in search of an exit*: Hell, afterlife, purgatory? Where are they? As the number 1 spot on this list I think this episode is one of the most heartbreaking ones out of the show. These pour souls are the victims of an annual event that leaves you wondering. It’s very hard to speak about this episode without spoiling it, but you really do route for them escaping. 


Honourable mentions that are still worth a viewing: 
*The Time Element.*yes, I know this isn’t officially apart of the Twilight Zone, but it was a Pilot for it and is a very good story. If you are looking for another time travel episode this is a nice long one to watch. 

*The Arrival:* Classic mystery that you will obsess about, like the main character does. 
*One for the Angels:* This is the second episode of season 1 and it’s the first episode where I found out there can be happy endings in the Twilight Zone. This ending is definitely a good one and makes you think about mortality in a way that only the Twilight Zone can. 

*Odyssey of Flight 33:* Time travel, unknown forces, being alone for the ride on this whole experience. This is Twilight Zone at its peak, using a simple premise to make you go and the pilots try and figure out what is going on. 

*Static:* there is something comforting in this episode and its ambiguous nature. An old radio brings back memories for a regretful man.
Night of the Meek: If you like a good Christmas story with a tug of the heart strings, this is this episode for you. It is one of the few Twilight Zone episodes with a good/happy ending.

Just wondering if anyone feels the same way I do. But does anyone wonder what are the names of the music used across some of the episodes.

0,"Apart from a few weak episodes, this left a bigger impression on me than Season 1.

My favorite episodes:

* Shadow Play - probably my most favorite TZ episode so far. Namely because I've personally had dreams where I realize I'm in a dream and I'm trapped, and I keep going back to sleep (in the dream) and hoping to wake up to reality, but end up just waking up into another dream, over and over again. It FUCKING SUCKS!

* A Penny for Your Thoughts - funnier than I expected, Dick York was awesome, even though I'd seen it as a child I was riveted the entire time. I really enjoyed how they took the concept and ran with it. Lots of good ideas executed well.

* Silence - it's probably the most terrifying episode of all the TZs I've watched. Namely because it can take place in our reality.

Honorable mentions:

* Invaders - enjoyed the creepy atmosphere and the fact it had uniquely almost zero dialogue until the end

* Mr. Dingle - not conceptually a strong episode but I enjoyed watching Burgess Meredith and Don Rickles' performances

Additional thoughts:

* Prime Mover - One of the few episodes that contained the aggravating trope of the mc who does progressively stupider and stupider things, but still found that the resolution saved the episode somewhat.

* Eye of the Beholder - obvious classic but since I remember it so vividly as a child, the big reveal didn't have the same impact on me as an adult.

* A Most Unusual Camera - really recommend the indie movie  ""Time Lapse"" if you want to see an entire film based on this premise.

* Night of the Meek - just a sweet Xmas episode

* The Whole Truth - really did not like how this ended with Khrushchev. It made the episode topical, and the lasting appeal of TZ is that it generally non-topical and covers age-old themes. Also why I wasn't crazy about the Genie in A Bottle one either.

* The Rip Van Winkle Caper - Like how they tied in the story with the conflict between the greedy thief, gold bars, and the water

* Obsolete Man - Not crazy about this episode, and felt it was the weakest one in Season 2. Everything was extremely overwrought. 

* I was unfortunately spoilered for the Howling Man, not sure what I would have thought if I watched it without knowing the reveal.

4,"OK, have any of you seen this one? It's one of those ones that are filmed on videotape so that they look like junk. Let me tell you about it. There's this lady in the hospital, and she has a boyfriend, and then Dr. Smith from Lost In Space is the doctor, and every night, the lady has this dream where she goes down to the hospital morgue and meets this creepy nurse who says ""Room for one more, Honey,"" then she leaves the hospital and almost gets on this plane, buit the nurse is on the plane, so she runs away and then the plane takes off and blows up. And that's it.

Like ""The Grave,"" this episode is cheap, ripped off, a bad example of a good show. It's from an old urban legend, as a matter of fact, except in the urban legend, the nurse is a guy in a hearse and the plane is an elevator. Apart from that, nothing is changed. This is a clear ripoff. The only other thing that's changed is the fact that the nurse says ""Honey"". Is that supposed to make it scarier? It sounds laughable. They must have really run out of ideas on the week this episode aired. It's awful. 

It's shot on videotape- that's one reason it sucks. It may as well have been recorded on Swiss cheese. Not to say that some of the videotape episodes aren't good. Long Distance Call is really good, and it's on videotape. But Twenty Two has both a dumb plot and a horrible shooting method, which makes it insufferable. It's an insult. It looks cheesy.

Apart from that, none of the characters are likable. The lady is an idiot, her boyfriend is an idiot, and she still leaves the room even after Dr. Smith tells her not to. Dr. Smith is OK, but I can't think of him doing anything other than being in Lost In Space. He's better in The Wager. You can tell he's doing nothing here. The episode doesn't even manage to instill a tiny amount of terror in me. I know it;s ripped off, and it's never explained who the nurse is- the best Twilight Zone episodes don't leave any loose ends. Those are my thoughts on this pathetic travesty.

Usually I dislike monologues because I find them a sign of lazy writing, but I'm generally not bothered by them in the series, and they're delivered fairly well. I think I'd just nope out of any other show that had this degree of monologuing, but I can forgive TW. :)

6,"Hopefully I'm not the oldest person on this sub (*weeps softly*), so maybe someone can share their experience with TZ now vs. watching it when they were much younger.

Things I've noticed:

1) there sure are a lot of harpy-wife characters! I see hardly this type of character now in modern television.

2) that slot machine episode is hilarious now vs. freaky when when I was a kid

3) acting is overall very good. No idea what was good or bad acting when I was a kid.

4) moral issues are fairly clear cut in the series. People are good, decent, or rotten. The moral ambiguity of today's television is much stronger.

5) TZ debuted 10 years after WW2, 8 years after the beginning of the Cold War, and 10 years before the moon landing. It sheds an interesting light on the series, how Serling saw other planets, extraterrestrial life, war and the potential for a nuclear holocaust.

6) I remember being terrified by Little Girl Lost and how that gave me nightmares for years. Haven't rewatched it yet, wonder if I'm just going to roll my eyes at my young self or not.

7) I don't remember ever crying during a TZ episode as a child. Actually sniffled a little during some the episodes I've rewatched.

3,"I have a younger cousin who is learning sign language. He can hear perfectly, he just wants to work with people with disabilities. 

I was wondering for the twilight zone series, which episodes would you find most interesting on mute? This means you’re just watching the show with no sound and no captions. You have to follow the episode purely on visual effects and sight.

I would enjoy seeing Perchance to Dream and Walking Distance on mute. Both rely heavily on visual effects, so the episode isn’t impossible to follow. 

You would also notice some imagery better, like the funhouse and other carnival scenes in Perchance to Dream. 

Walking Distance has wonderful imagery of the small town of Homewood, and you could still follow Martin as he visits all of his childhood hang out spots. You can still see the band concert, merry go round, park scenes, the houses, the ice cream shop, etc. The only thing you would really miss would be the final father and son conversation. You wouldn’t hear the one summer to a customer line, and the father telling Martin to look ahead, instead of behind. But the imagery would be just as nostalgic and poignant.

Watching an episode without picture is basically a radio drama. So no visual imagery, just audio. I would pick The Jungle, A Piano in the House, and The Lonely. The first two are self explanatory, due to the sound and music effects that are prevalent in both episodes. 

I would enjoy hearing the drums, lion roaring, and voodoo sounds in The Jungle. 

A Piano in the House, would allow you to focus more on the songs, and background music accompanying them. It would be interesting to see how people’s reactions and emotions to the songs would be described. 

The Lonely is something I chose because of the isolation factor. How the struggles of complete isolation can wear down a person is difficult to describe without showing it. You can’t see Corry breaking down from boredom. And the contrast in emotions when Alicia arrives and Corry forms an attachment to her, even though he is fully aware that she is a robot. Then we get the final scene where Alicia is shot, and Corry’s world is shattered, even though he has been pardoned and can return to Earth. The twists and turns this episode takes would be interesting to hear, and all done without any imagery.

5,"1. If you were in the episode, would you rather raise Billy Mumy's temper, and go to the Cornfield knowing that you had done the right thing, or stay with him as his slave and serve his every maniacal whim without batting an eye?

2. What the Heck is the Cornfield?

3. If you look at this episode from the perspective of the adults, it's a very depressing episode with a very depressing ending, but if you look at the episode from the perspective of Billy Mumy, it's a very happy episode with a very happy ending!

4. Once Billy Mumy sends everybody to the Cornfield for disobeying, will he get bored or lonely, and maybe realize that world domination isn't his forte? What will he do once he's gotten rid of everybody? Should there be a sequel about it, with adult Billy Mumy wandering around Peaksville, starving to death because he made it snow and ruined all the crops?

5. If you're living in a nightmarish Hellscape ruled by a kid who hates singing, and it's your husband's birthday, then the WORST TWO POSSIBLE PRESENTS YOU COULD GET HIM are a bottle of whiskey to make him forget that his life is in danger and a record with lots of singing on it that he used to like prior to the rise of the Satan-child and will want to play immediately. These two presents are bad enough on top of the fact that your Husband's birthday is a day where the Satan-child is not the center of attention.

6. The only character I like in this episode is Dan, because he's the only one who ends the facade and acts like a real person- and makes the very logical assumption that Billy Mumy could easily be knocked unconscious with a heavy household object- and that his demise could result in the restoration of humanity as they know it, or at least the return of order to responsible minds. Every other character is an unlikable sissy. Dan goes to the cornfield with a smile on his face- which is more than a few Twilight Zone characters can say.

Reported MIB encounters peaked sometime in the 50s or 60s so it wouldn't be surprising if Serling gave a nod to the phenomenon.

Also, anyone else get wrapped up in the Star Wars parallels? A kid's Aunt/guardian repeatedly scolds the precocious whippersnapper for hanging out with a weird old magic guy LITERALLY NAMED OLD BEN.

Instead of dying, he vanishes into thin air, and, as Obi Wan promised, he comes back ""more powerful than you can possibly imagine"" (a king, in this case). And although it's flipped chronologically, he takes Jenny away from her home where she has always felt out of place to a frickin adventure in space.

9,"""**A Thing About Machines""**

**Written by** \- Rod Serling

**Directed by** \-  David Orrick McDearmon

**Plot** \-  Bartlett Finchley's paranoia about the machines around proves true. \[IMDB\]

**Opening Narration**

 *This is Mr. Bartlett Finchley, age forty-eight, a practicing sophisticate who writes very special and very precious things for gourmet magazines and the like. He's a bachelor and a recluse with few friends, only devotees and adherents to the cause of tart sophistry. He has no interests save whatever current annoyances he can put his mind to. He has no purpose to his life except the formulation of day-to-day opportunities to vent his wrath on mechanical contrivances of an age he abhors. In short, Mr. Bartlett Finchley is a malcontent, born either too late or too early in the century, and who, in just a moment, will enter a realm where muscles and the will to fight back are not limited to human beings. Next stop for Mr. Bartlett Finchley - The Twilight Zone.* 

**Closing Narration**

 *Yes, it could just be. It could just be that Mr. Bartlett Finchley succumbed from a heart attack and a set of delusions. It could just be that he was tormented by an imagination as sharp as his wit and as pointed as his dislikes. But as perceived by those attending, this is one explanation that has left the premises with the deceased. Look for it filed under 'M' for Machines - in The Twilight Zone.*

10,"Background: I watched TW religiously when I was a kid but don't remember the majority of them other than the ones that were cult classics (Talking Tina, the Hitchhiker, etc.)

* It's a real pleasure going through these now. Even though some are overly heavy handed with the moralizing, the show has a real sense of humanity to it that I haven't seen in most TV, now or then. Serling focuses on a lot of characters who wouldn't get much attention otherwise: the town drunk, the aging actress, the kind sidewalk vendor. It's nice to see character types that are routinely sidelined be the focus of their own episodes.

* I really loathe reboots, but I think TW might be an exception since some of the effects are pretty dated. If Jordan Peele keeps the concise dialogue and spirit of TW, I'd gladly rewatch these again. Serling was a fantastic writer.

* Watching ""Where is Everybody"" was interesting given the moon landing occurred 10 years later. In fact every episode that involves the ""past"" (or future) is interesting because it's from the point of view of Serling in the 60s. ""Walking Distance"", for 
 example, gave me a bit of a ride because it's a late 50's view of the 20's. 

Anyway, I think I have 38473874 episodes left. (Glad there are so many.)

15,"It’s stated in the episode that the Kanamits communicate telepathically, through some type of brain wave. Instead of verbally like how humans do. I’m guessing their language was more complex than any that was present on Earth at the time. 

It would seem almost impossible to know where to begin. There’s no way of knowing if their word structure has any similarity to a written language on Earth. The language could have easily been something that if translated correctly, would be full of words describing objects and ideas which have never manifested itself on our planet, and would not be intelligible to humans. It could have been describing things that were only present on the Kanamits planet. 

I enjoy the episode very much, but found it unlikely that the language could be translated at a pretty quick pace.

1,"We see in this episode that Tennyson is loud mouthed and talkative. He irritates Colonel Taylor, a long standing member of the men’s club, to the point that Taylor bets him half a million dollars to remain silent for a year. 

Taylor, along with the rest of the club members, don’t believe Tennyson can keep up his end of the bet. They are all surprised as the months go by, especially Taylor, who resorts to dirty tactics to get Tennyson to give up. At the end, Tennyson wins the wager, but Taylor has already lost his fortune years ago, and can’t afford to pay him off. Tennyson reveals to the rest of the club that he had his vocal chords permanently severed before the start of the bet, as he knew he couldn’t hold his end of the bargain. 

Do you feel this constitutes cheating on Tennyson’s part? If Taylor had the half a million dollars, would he be obligated to pay off? Tennyson obviously made an extreme sacrifice to win the wager (losing his voice forever), but at the same time, he went into the first day of the challenge knowing he already won. Taylor clearly lied about having money, and was dirty in insulting Tennyson, especially gossiping about his wife.

0,"OK, this is a minor problem, I'll admit. But I just don't get it. Every episode- every single one- Rod shows up right next to the characters he's talking about. It's an interesting way to frame a narrative, and bring all the episodes together, in a sense. Rod is the only consistent character, and his iconic style of narration is unparalleled, but why is he everywhere, talking aabout people without them noticing?

Take his other series, Night Gallery. The narration makes a lot more sense. He runs a creepy art museum, and he uncovers paintings, and each painting is connected to a certain creepy story. I can get that. It's a good way of universe building. But with Twilight Zone, on the other hand, he never explains what he's doing there. It's not creepy, really. Just weird. 

When he's just on a street or something, in a crowded urban area, it's not too unsettling, but I can think of lots of times where this form of narration is unpractical. in ""The Fear,"" for instance, the lady is talking about how she's scared of sounds on her roof. It's a very dramatic scene. Then, not, like, ten feet from the main characters, in the very same house, Rod is talking about the episode, right in front of her fireplace. He's scarier than anything up on the roof, in that case. 

The only time I can recall when he breaks this form is in the creepy Billy Mumy episode. He's talking about how Billy Mumy has caused most of the United States to disappear, and he's just in front of a blank background, pointing to a map. A kind of proto-Night Gallery, if you will. He's also in front of the same blank background in each next episode promo. But he never does that for his intros, only for his outros.

Don't get me wrong, it's a very dramatic and unique way to narrate. It's nostalgic and it's parodied a lot, and nothing like it has been done since. I love it. I just don't get it. It's an interesting way to handle it. Rod Serling, I suppose, wants to be a character in his own work of art without interfering with the main characters. but if he's trying to build a sort of universe, where he serves as an ever present, prophetic, invulnerable diety... then I need an explanation, that's all. Just some kind of explanation.

Take The Outer Limits. It has a consistent form of narration, and, like in The Twilight Zone, it's a unique way of introducing a show. But, unlike The Twilight Zone, it has a backstory. Aliens have invaded your TV, and they're showing you stuff. not much of a backstory, but it gets the point across. very simple, but a little exposition. In Twilight Zone, we're given no explanation as to how Rod can break through walls, into safes, into restaurants, into outer space. We're given no explanation as to what the Heck he's doing there or why none of the other characters see him. I don't think he's playing an alien or something. He's just Rod Serling, average guy, very audible voice. Is he invisible? Is he a ghost? Maybe the pilot should have had him drink an invisibility potion or something.

Anyway, that's what I've got. Any reason behind the way he decides to narrate his stuff? It's almost funny, I swear. Even if he's trying to be completely deadpan straight, it's still funny. It's a weird way to narrate something when we could just hear his voice. Any answers? ",Iamnotthethe,The way Roddy shows up EVERYWHERE,1528416441,13,True,TwilightZone,2018-06-07

5,"OK, I'm sure ya know this one. In season 4, Episode 14, Mr. Feathersmith is a rich jerk, he buys out all his competitors and drives a bunch of people to ruin. After he's demolished his last competitor's life, he gets bored about how things are. He realizes that getting rich is more fun than just being rich. He talks it over with Mr. Hecate, the elderly janitor, while he's drunk and bored. Mr. Hecate remarks that both he and Mr. Feathersmith are from Cliffordville, Indiana, and by a strange coincidence, one of them is a janitor and one of them is a zillionaire. Mr. Feathersmith goes to the elevator.

It doesn't take him to the ground floor, though, it takes him to this incredibly bizarre, tacky travel agency run by Ms. Devlin, who's clearly just a female version of Satan, played by Julie Newmar, Catwoman from the old Batman show. She says that Mr. Feathersmith is bored, so he can go back to Cliffordville and experience all the joy of building it up again. Mr. Feathersmith is gullible, and isn't the least bit fazed by the fact that he's talking to the LITERAL EMBODIMENT OF EVIL, so he agrees, and gives up his entire fortune on one time travel trip because he thinks that nothing will go wrong (Yeah, right) and even tells Ms. Devlin that he's not a sucker and that she's not going to trick him in any way. She says that, because of his past behavior, he doesn't even have to pay his soul, because they already have it and he's going to go to Hell no matter what. At this point, you'd think Mr. Feathersmith would cry like a baby, maybe repent, and the episode would be over, but Nope, he goes ahead, and Ms. Devlin transports him back to Cliffordville around the turn of the century, so he can relive his entire life, all over again. 

Mr. Feathersmith makes a deal, he thinks he's got everything, and he buys up the land where he knows there's oil, but as it turns out it's the turn of the century and the technology is so crappy that they can't reach the oil because its buried too deep. Mr. Feathersmith walks out in disgust, and then tries to tell people that they can help him out, but nobody buys it. Ms. Devlin tells him that he's all washed up, but he can go back to his own time if he has forty bucks. It just so happens that the deeds to his land add up to forty bucks, so he sells them to a younger version of Hecate, and gets on the train.

Then, in the closing scene, Hecate is portrayed as a rich jerk, and Mr. Feathersmith is the janitor, and Mr. Hecate is a jerk to Mr. Feathersmith just like Mr. Feathersmith was a jerk to Hecate when he was the janitor. Mr. Hecate gloats over how he got his start from the deeds that Mr. Feathersmith gave him, and then the episode's over. 

I have a few questions about this. Lots, in fact. OK, the first one, the one that comes to mind the easiest, is this: Ms. Devlin told Mr. Feathersmith that he was going to Hell no matter what because he was a rich jerk and drove lots of people to suicide. It's a new spin on the old soul selling trope. They've already got his soul, there's nothing he can do about it. We know one thing about the world of this episode: Greedy people go to Hell. Nice people, on the other hand, like Mr. Hecate, the old janitor, presumably go to Heaven, for being so nice and helpful and everything. Now here's my question: if Ms. Devlin switches their roles around- so that Mr. Hecate is the rich jerk, and Mr. Feathersmith is the poor janitor- wouldn't Mr. Hecate go to Hell, and wouldn't Mr. Feathersmith go to Heaven? They have, after all, reversed roles. Here's another question. If Ms. Devlin was out to show Mr. Feathersmith the error of his ways, and show him that greedy people always end up in Hell, and ruin the world- is she doing the world a favor to replace him with an equally vicious, snarky tycoon? Nothing's changed except their roles, after all. Now Hecate has the monopoly instead of Hecate, now he's sitting at the top of the heap- but has Ms. Devlin really taught anybody anything? Mr. Feathersmith might have gotten some hard knocks, sure. But Hecate has learned that greed and hatred always pay off. Which isn't the moral. Ms. Devlin set the events of the episode in place- so if Hecate has grown fat and rich off of his ill gotten gains, because Mr. Feathersmith just had to sell those deeds- Ms. Devlin hasn't really done anything. She's just replaced one greedy millionaire with another. If you watch the episode from Mr. Feathersmith's perspective, he's learned a lesson. But if you watch the episode from Hecate's perspective, the exact opposite is true. He hasn't learned a thing about greed. He's just as much of a jerk as Mr. Feathersmith- and he got that way because of Ms. Devlin.

Here's something else to think about- what if Mr. Hecate gets bored with being rich? Would he wander down to the elevator, into Ms. Devlin's travel office, then make the same mistakes and end up having to sell HIS bonds back to Mr. Feathersmith, to get back to his won time? Would they end up selling the deeds off to one another, in a kind of infinite loop, forever trading places? Has a lesson really been learned, or has Ms. Devlin set off an inevitable chain of events, where they perpetually grow tired of their riches, go back, make a mistake, and give their fortunes to the other? Who can say? The message of the episode seems to be that rich people only become rich because of coincidence- but Ms. Devlin is no coincidence. She's orchestrated the whole thing. Who knows if the events portrayed in the episode are really the beginning of it all? What if there were infinite janitor Feathersmiths and infinite millionaire Hecates before what we see? And after, too? It boggles the mind.

You really have to put this into perspective. At the beginning of the story, Mr. Feathersmith is going to Hell no matter what- Ms. Devlin says so, because he's lived a vicious, mean spirited life and he has to pay cash instead of his soul. But by making them reverse roles- won't Mr. Hecate go to Hell? And won't Mr. Feathersmith, the nice, kindly janitor, go up to the Pearly Gates for having 40 years of service, and gaining his gold watch in the process? The ending of the episode might seem sad, but really, Mr. Feathersmith is the winner, because clearly the world of the episode has some notion of Heaven and Hell. Does Ms. Devlin think that Mr. Feathersmith has suffered enough, trying to convince the two Cliffordville mechanics that they can build a motor, only to have them laugh in his face? It doesn't seem like the Devil would have too much compassion for a protagonist as loathsome as Feathersmith. But what she's done essentially, by messing up time, is given Mr. Hecate a spot in Hell, because of Mr. Feathersmith's foolish choice to travel backward into time- and she's given Mr. Feathersmith an undeserved spot in Heaven that ignores his actions before he gave Mr. Hecate the deeds back. It seems as if he loses, but he really does win, in the end- because he's no longer a jerk.

Here's how I think the episode could have ended, a little better. Let's say that Mr. Feathersmith makes a fool of himself, back at the turn of the century. He goofs around. He becomes a laughing stock among the townsfolk, and nobody will give him a decent job, even if he begs for it. He's declared a lunatic and gets thoroughly ostracized by the members of his community. In the end, he's become destitute, and has to eat scraps off the road. He's lost, and he won't ever regain his fortune, and not only that- but he's living in the wrong time, with no Ms. Devlin in sight. The end. See? No alteration in Hecate's life, just his own. Hecate, let's say, decides to be a janitor, like he did before- and works for a similar millionaire- but this millionaire is less harsh, a bit more forgiving, less cutthroat, kinder to his hard working employees. It could even be Mr. Dietrich, Feathersmith's chief competitor in the present timeline, just for the sake of argument. Hecate doesn't end up making a complete fortune, but he ends up in the middle class, with a decent janitor income and a great family. Feathersmith remains poor, gets into drinking, and commits suicide, and still goes to Hell. Now THERE'S a good ending. Justice is given out. Nobody switches places, but the ending is satisfying and all the pieces of the puzzle are put in place. Less sloppy. 

There are still a few minor details of this episode worth going over. For one, Mr. Feathersmith is a little too calm when Ms. Devlin takes off her hat and reveals her two horns- she doesn't even try to act casual about it, and he isn't even bothered in the least. I also wonder why Mr. Feathersmith would give up his two deeds just to be back in the present day. he went back to Cliffordville for the rustic, nostalgic charm- so couldn't he keep the deeds and make his fortune in some other way? He could work as a fry cook until a better oil drill is developed- in fact, that's why Hecate becomes a millionaire at the end- because he was more patient and hung on to the deeds until a suitable time. There are more ways to gain wealth than just by buying an oil field- and if Mr. Feathersmith was going to build up his money in the exact same way, then why go at all? If he's not even going to put a little creativity into it, why not just stay in the present? He'd also apparently rather go back to the present day, where he's older- than stay in the past, and be optimistic about his situation. I mean, he gives up his worldly possessions just to go back to the sixties. What's so great about the sixties? Sure, they had better medicine and stuff- but also more pollution, and less opportunities to make money- which is why Mr. Feathersmith went back in time to begin with. The last gripe I have with the episode is the way in which Ms. Devlin tricks Mr. Feathersmith. He says he wants to look the same when he goes back into the past- so she makes him look the same, but she keeps his real age the same, so he's still old and far less agile. It's supposed to be a loophole, I know, and it's meant to prove that The Devil always finds a loophole somewhere- but she says that his insides are the same and only his outsides are different. Who's to say where the outsides end and the insides begin? Are his teeth still rotted? What if he went to the local Cliffordville doctor? He'd be treated as a medical anomaly. 

Apart from that, this is a good episode. The makeup is superb, the actors are terrific, and wholly believable, and it's an interesting way to handle the whole time travel concept. These are some problems I have with it. Can you answer them? ",Iamnotthethe,Of Late I Think About The Episode About Cliffordville,1528756067,8,True,TwilightZone,2018-06-11

2,"I love The After Hours, honestly. Great episode. I can't get enough of it. The plot's great, the characters are convincing, the twist knocks the wind out of you. I've seen it lots and lots of times. But, recently, I rewatched it, and I noticed one tiny little quirk in it. Just one tiny little quirk that I don't really get.

So, there's the scene where Marsha goes to the manager of the store or whatever, and she says that she got the gold thimble on the ninth floor. The manager tells her that the store doesn't have a ninth floor. Now, that's all fine and good, I get that. But I have to wonder, here- if there is no ninth floor, and humans can't access it, and only mannequins can go up there- then where does the store get its mannequins?

The manager says to Marsha that there is no ninth floor, period. If the ninth floor is where the mannequins hang out and chill- then the store would have to get them from up there. Instead of telling Marsha that there's no ninth floor, maybe he could say, ""Well, we DO have a ninth floor- but it's a storage space where we store mannequins and stuff, and it's not accessible to customers."" That would make sense. That would fix the whole thing.

Let's say that the store just goes up to the ninth floor whenever they need some new mannequins, and the mannequins pretend like they're not alive when the store sends somebody up to get them. That would make sense. I mean, the ninth floor certainly does RESEMBLE some kind of storage space, being so empty and desolate and all. 

The store clearly isn't in on the whole living mannequins thing, at least not so far as we can tell. The guy at the end is weirded out by how the mannequin resembles Marsha. They don't know that their mannequins are alive, or that they live on a floor that doesn't exist. Those mannequins have to come from somewhere, they have to be put away somewhere when they're not being used. The guy in charge of mannequins, being human, would have to go somewhere that doesn't really exist every time he went to get some mannequins. That's a little nutty. 

Every store has some spot where they put mannequins when they're not in use. Maybe the ninth floor is just a storage space, but it has to be somewhere that humans can access. Every store has some sort of mannequin circulation, I know that for a fact. I can accept living mannequins, that's awesome. But I just can't accept that the store isn't aware of where their mannequins come from, that they've come straight out of a spatial paradox.

3,"In the beginning, we see Al Denton being harassed by Dan Hotaling, town bully. Denton is such a desperate alcoholic, he would embarrass himself by singing a little song just to get some booze. We also see the cocktail waitress, Miss Smith, feel sorry for Denton. I think she sees the broken man he is, and has a gut feeling that things weren’t always that way, and something caused this break down. 

Later on, we see a mysterious wagon stop by, and a gun falls to the ground. Denton picks it up, and as Hotaling is about to harass him again, a challenge ensues. Denton surprisingly gets his shooting skills back and shoots the gun out of Hotaling’s hand. He proves his talent again in the bar and regains a sense of purpose. 

Denton’s rise as a top marksman doesn’t go unnoticed. Soon, a brash young challenger arrives in town and Denton must prove himself once again. He wants to avoid the showdown, but can’t. 

We see the wagon appear in the night. A peddler, by the name of Henry J Fate, gives Denton his special tonic. It will make a person perfectly accurate for only 10 seconds. Denton shoots a lamppost way off in the distance, and is satisfied with the tonic. One of the best lines is then spoken, as the peddler says to Denton, you can think about “the night Fate stepped in”. 

Denton and the young challenger, Pete, duel in the bar. The twist is that both men have the same tonic, given to them by Fate. The duel is a draw, as both men are grazed on the hand. Denton says to Pete, that he’s blessed and can never fire a gun in anger again. Denton is able to regain his pride and honor, and is no longer bullied by Hotaling, who has presumably left town.

A very captivating Western themed episode. It’s a story of redemption for Denton, who had been bullied, harassed, and intimidated into a pile of broken ruins. We find out the reason for Denton’s alcoholism, as he was once a top shooter, but killed or injured several men along the way, including a young 18 year old, who likely died soon afterwards. 

Throughout the episode, Denton’s emotional ups and downs are revealed. He feels more powerful with the gun, as Hotaling can no longer bully him. Yet, he knows his past, and the sense of having to prove himself means potentially leaving more victims in his path.

Fate is an interesting character as well. He has the desire to help other with his tonics and potions. He’s a traveling peddler, going from town to town. But does he have a special item for each person he meets, similarly to how Pedott in “What You Need” can see into the future? Or is it pure coincidence that he had a shooting accuracy tonic available for both gunmen in that town? I like to think it’s a combination of both. 

The setting for this episode is great. It captures the feeling of a small, Western town very well. With the saloon being the main place of people gathering, and the sense that the town is so tiny, a bully like Hotaling can have control over it. Until Denton gains the courage to face him.

2,"OK, so you all know this one, right? Archibald Beechcroft, antisocial introvert, hates everybody and everything. His annoying acquaintance, Henry, gives him a book about how people can do things through the power of suggestion. He takes the book and tries to use it, and makes all the people in the world vanish in a poof. But then he gets really bored, sitting alone with nobody to talk to. So he thinks, ""Hey, if there was a world full of ME, that would be great!"" But then, everybody in that world is just as antisocial as he is, so he restores the world back to the way it was. There's just one titchy problem with the whole thing. And that one problem kinda unraveled it for me.

The problem is this: He has complete control over the world, right?  he can do anything he wants with his mind, anything at all. If he creates a world of HIMs, and HE's OK with everybody being HIM- then all the other HIMs should be OK with being around other HIMs. Am I right? It has to be that way. It's the way his mind operates. He only hates other people. He enjoys being around himself. He's a big egotist. If there was a world with nobody but HIM, then I think all the HIMs would be just hunky dory and they could really get along, because they all share common interests and everything. The episode seems to imply that his ONLY CHARACTER TRAIT is being antisocial. He must be a little more complex than that. 

Aside from that, he can do anything with his mind- anything at all. Nothing he does can go wrong. If he says, ""I want a world of ME, and everybody will get along,"" then that's how it'll be. They won't fight, and they won't bicker- because that's not the way he thought about it. And he could always have tried again until he got it right. I mean, he's practically God- so who's there to stop him from creating the perfect world, full of HIMs who pleasantly chat about how nice it is to be Archibald Beechcroft? It seems insane. The episode goes to all the trouble of introducing us to a character who only cares about himself, and hates other people- and then suggests that his beliefs are somehow flawed. But HOW? If he likes himself, and he hates other people, a world of HIMs wouldn't be antisocial to each other!

It makes no sense. You might say it's only a moral. I say that morals have to make sense. There are better ways to prevent antisocial behavior. Or maybe there shouldn't be episodes like this- I think that antisocial introverts have the right to behave the way they do. The concept is interesting, he plays the character pretty well, and it's incredibly funny to see him in drag in the elevator. But it just makes no sense, and that part is badly written, except to produce this very, very mind stimulating paradox. Can anybody explain this? i don't get it. I really don't.

5,"This is the script that put Serling on the map.

From Wikipedia:

In 1955, the nationwide Kraft Television Theatre televised a program based on Serling's 72nd script. To Serling, it was just another script, and he missed the first live broadcast. He and his wife hired a babysitter for the night and told her ""no one would call because we had just moved to town. And the phone just started ringing and didn't stop for years!"" The title of this episode was ""Patterns"", and it soon changed his life.

""Patterns"" dramatized the power struggle between a veteran corporate boss running out of ideas and energy and the bright, young executive being groomed to take his place. Instead of firing the loyal employee and risk tarnishing his own reputation, the boss enlists him into a campaign to push aside his competition. Serling modeled the main[clarification needed] character on his former commander, Colonel Orin Haugen.

The New York Times critic Jack Gould called the show ""one of the high points in the TV medium's evolution"" and said, ""[f]or sheer power of narrative, forcefulness of characterization and brilliant climax, Mr. Serling's work is a creative triumph."" Robert Lewis Shayon stated in the Saturday Review, ""in the years I have been watching television I do not recall being so engaged by a drama, nor so stimulated to challenge the haunting conclusions of an hour's entertainment."" The episode was a hit with the audience as well, and a second live show was staged by popular demand one month later. During the time between the two shows, Kraft executives negotiated with people from Hollywood over the rights to ""Patterns"". Kraft said they were considering rebroadcasting ""Patterns"", unless the play or motion picture rights were sold first.

Immediately following the original broadcast of ""Patterns"", Serling was inundated with offers of permanent jobs, congratulations and requests for novels, plays and television or radio scripts. He quickly sold many of his earlier, lower-quality works and watched in dismay as they were published. Critics expressed concern that he was not living up to his promise and began to doubt he was able to recreate the quality of writing that ""Patterns"" had shown.",-XQV-,Patterns is available for free on Amazon Prime,1527411241,5,True,TwilightZone,2018-05-27

Both deal with war. 

Max Phillips is a bookmaker down on his luck. He drinks because he can’t shake the negative images out of his head. Wherever he goes, death follows close behind. Only it’s not his death impending, it’s the death of those around him. He can see death on the faces of those to soon die. The final straw is when his son returns home for a surprise visit. Death is on Pip’s face. Pip will die after being shipped off to Vietnam. Max takes Pip to the local amusement park for one final memory, and makes a deal to trade his own life for the future and well being of his only son. 


A Game Of Pool/Steel 

Both deal with sports, competition, the desire to win at all costs. 

Jesse Cardiff is the best at his game. He dominates Lister’s Pool Room. Nobody can beat him. He has run out of legitimate challengers. He’s getting bored and needs the ultimate challenge. He summons the ghost of Fats Brown, who to his surprise, actually shows up. 

Jesse and Fats begin the game. Only Fats has a secret. He’s a perfectly precise mechanical robot, built by his creator, Steel Kelly. Steel created Fats as the ultimate pool player, so he could make a fortune and live in luxury. Jesse and Fats battle down to the last shot. Jesse sinks the game winning ball. Before Fats leaves, Jesse rolls up his sleeves to show he is also a robot, only a better one. 

Ring a Ding Girl/Nick of Time

Both deal with subliminal messages, superstition, and beliefs

Bunny Blake is a Hollywood Star, famous and mega rich. Although money is no object to her, she whittles away her time by tossing pennies into the fortune telling machine at a cheap diner. Bunny is superstitious to a fault, and credits her acting success to following good luck rituals. She also carries a rabbit foot and a bag full of four leaf clovers wherever she goes. And most importantly, her lucky ring. 

Bunny receives messages from the fortune telling machine that suggests death and tragedy will soon occur. She has no choice but to believe them. She gathers everyone in her hometown to the auditorium for a performance of her most well known play. The performance falls on the same day as the Founder’s Day picnic. A plane crash occurs at the picnic grounds, luckily most people are not hurt, because they chose to attend Bunny’s performance. Satisfied with saving the townspeople, Bunny mysteriously vanishes after leaving the auditorium.

OK, bear with me here, while I point out all the similarities. 

Normal seeming setting, group of people. Strange occurrence leads to suspicions of aliens in the area. People are completely isolated and can't go anywhere. Paranoia starts in. Weird things start happening. People start pointing fingers at one another. The conflict ends. Then the real alien is revealed. The end. Those are a heck of a lot of coincidences.

The only thing that sets them apart, really, is that on Maple Street the paranoia goes a little further. As I recall, Maple Street came first. That makes the diner one seem completely extraneous, although I have to admit, I do appreciate that real cool third eye at the end. That's one of the only things in the whole series that's really scared me. Other than that, though, it seems like they took the same idea and repeated it, twice. Any reason why they would do that?

9,"OK, so this has bugged me for a long time. The Midnight Sun is about a future where the Earth has moved just about an inch or two closer to the Sun, right? And it makes everything become all hot and terrible. But here's my problem- Rod Serling, in the introduction, says that ""There is no Night Anymore"". That's not hyperbole- one of the aspects of this episode is that there REALLY IS NO NIGHT. 

I'm not sure how this could happen. The episode never mentions the Earth completely stopping its daily spin, on its axis- just getting closer to the sun-but even if it did stop spinning on its axis- which is an event that's unlikely to happen in exact synchronization with the Earth moving closer to The Sun, mind you- there would still be night. One side of Earth would be lit up forever, and one side would be dark forever. In that case, humanity could just move to the dark side, or, if the dark side was too cold, they could live in between the two zones. Either way, regardless of whether the Earth stops spinning or not, there is no way that everybody would be basked in perpetual daylight. The people over in China wouldn't be facing the same predicament- they'd be having a continuous night. Maybe a warm night, sure, but a night nonetheless.

This is really just simple astronomy. A body of light like the Sun can't light up the whole Earth at once- even if it was closer. It could only light up half the Earth. For there to be constant lighting over the whole Earth, there would have to be multiple suns, multiple light sources- and thee episode never mentions that. So how in the world can something like this happen?

Please, don't answer this with ""Oh, it's just fantasy, it doesn't have to make sense"". Fantasy does have to make sense, in some respects. I can't figure out how something like this could happen. The only answer, I think, is lousy screenwriting. That's all I can think of, really. They just didn't realize that, no matter how horrible a predicament like this would be, there's simply no way that every single inch of the Earth could be perpetually bathed in sunlight. It just can't happen. Or can it? Let me know in the comments below. ",Iamnotthethe,"How does ""The Midnight Sun"" work?",1526163492,20,True,TwilightZone,2018-05-12

3,"“The Hunt” is a bad episode. Not just bad, it fails in pretty much every department. I can’t relate to the protagonist, the plot is cliche, and, furthermore, it just doesn’t make any sense. Allow me to give you a brief overview. This hillbilly lives with his wife, in a little cabin, and he’s a hunting maniac, so he goes out into the forest one night, with his dog. He dies, but doesn’t realize it somehow, and then he goes back to his cabin, and finds that he’s become an invisible ghost. He never tries to pick anything up and signal to anybody that he’s there, and he’s so dense that for five minutes or so he can’t tell that he’s dead even though he sees his own grave being dug. After this, he ventures off into the woods again and comes across an eternal fence, which serves as the entrance to the afterlife. He sees a gate, and the guy at the gate says that it leads into Heaven and that he can come in, and that there’s nothing else outside the gate. The hillbilly decides not to enter because they don’t allow dogs, and he has his dog with him. He goes further on, and finds a second gate, and there’s an angel there, who says that the first gate was actually Hell, that THIS one is Heaven, and that he can come in with his dog and live there happily ever after. Now, here’s the flaw:

The devil LIES. The devil lies. That’s my problem with this one. The Devil says that HELL is HEAVEN. I don’t think he should be allowed to do that. I think that God should give him a good going over. Think about how twisted this situation is, for a moment. If that guy hadn’t brought his dog with him, he would have been burned up for all eternity- EVEN THOUGH HE HADN’T SINNED WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. Is it just me, or is that unjust? There are lots of evil people in the world- does Satan really need to TRICK people into being burnt up? I don’t think he should do that. I think Satan needs to have some limits.

Take, for example, the hour-long episode where Burgess Meredith is Satan. He’s probably the best Satan in the whole series. He’s devious, and cunning, and he lights crooked cigars with his fingers. Consider the scene where Pengy tries to get the owner of the newspaper to sign his soul over with a contract. The contract is very blunt. It says, in plain lettering, that the guy is supposed to give Burgess his soul in exchange for good newspaper stories. There’s no beating around the bush. Burgess does try to deny his being the Devil, I’ll admit, but he also admits that, if the guy doesn’t sign the contract, then there’s nothing he can do about it, he’ll just leave and the guy will be alone again. People have to make deals with the Devil willingly, or the Devil is a cheater. Very simple, really. God has put certain restrictions, certain limitations on the Devil, to ensure that he doesn’t catch anybody off guard. Satan cannot lie, and his victims have to be OK with it. Burgess Meredith fulfills that description perfectly. He’s actually believable as the Devil. Not so with the guy in “The Hunt”.

Now, I have to ask you, why would Satan lie to the poor hillbilly guy? I don’t think Satan is entitled to do that. It would be OK, maybe, if Satan said, “This is Hell, yeah, but it really isn’t as bad as people make it out to be, it’s really very fun.” Then, if the hillbilly guy entered the gate, THEN Satan would be allowed to burn him up, I think, for falling for it. But Satan just flat out LIES. And that’s wrong. What sort of crumby afterlife allows Hell to disguise itself as Heaven and then punish people who did nothing? Heck, what can be certain? What if the Heaven at the end, the second gate, is really Hell? How does this afterlife work? Why does Satan get to do that? I think that God should, I dunno, discuss some ground rules with Satan here, and tell him that coaxing innocent people into his gates is a no-no. Seriously, I just don’t get this episode. Why does Satan get to do this? Can anybody explain it?

4,"Whenever I watch the original I also have to screen the John Lithgow remake too. Both are fantastic. True, the remake omits some pertinent details — our protagonist in Lithgow’s version, for instance, is merely afraid of flying while in the original he’s just been released from a sanitarium after suffering from a nervous breakdown on a plane six months prior (was he harassed by a creature only he could seemingly see then too?) — but it more than makes up for that by besting the original in its creature design– and wisely confining it, like Freddy Krueger in the original “Elm Street” movie, largely to the shadows. Also, the remake depicts what the original couldn’t owing, I guess, to budget constraints: the cabin depressurizing as a result of someone shooting out a window (or, in the original, releasing the emergency door) while the plane is in flight. And, finally, in the original, we mostly spend time with Bob, his wife and the crew. We never get acquainted with the other passengers. In the remake, we get a feel for some of the other personalities traveling with our protagonist and how it might be like for them to have to deal with someone who is totally wigging out in the middle of a storm… Oh, and one of the passengers is a little girl who is surprisingly not annoying at all.

They visit her and find that she appears normal but hysteria overtakes her and she threatens to kill them with a knife. Amanda suggests that it may be a disease since it is spread from person to person.

He eventually discovers that the source of the problem is not a physical disease but an idea—a short secret phrase—that is being passed by word of mouth from person to person. The phrase is about the purpose and meaning of existence. It was somehow discovered by the local resident, Jeffrey Potts while he was traveling abroad; his brother Andrew was the first victim of the word-disease. Jeffrey is compelled by a desire to share this insanity-inducing phrase with others, and sets up an appearance on the local radio station to tell the entire town the secret.

Sayers cannot make it to the station to stop the disclosure but he is able to reach Amanda in time to smash her radio. She then points out that she has already been visited by two townspeople and that she has something very important to tell him. She whispers in his ear, and his eyes widen in dawning comprehension.**

I find it interesting that a person would find an idea dangerous and intriguing.  Especially regarding the secret of life.

This episode was made a fifty years before people actually started being replaced by robots. This episode is from when computers took up a whole room. And if it wasn't for the computer that took up the whole room, and the episode was in color, I'd think it was from today. How the Hell did Rod Serling invent this problem before it was a topical issue? This is Jesus level prediction, right here. Does anybody care about it? How did Rod do it? This episode predicts robot AI in the 60s. THIS IS A HUGE FRICKIN' PREDICTION. How did Rod do this? HOW? This is just like a 9/11 prediction, but real.

The new ending would be that the law prohibiting human boxing is repealed, and Steel vows to get stronger to resume his former prizefighting career, and defeat the Maynard Flash in an eventual rematch.

Night Call: I don’t feel this episode needed a twist. I think the more justifiable ending would be that Elva Keene finally finds peace in her life, and makes amends with her dead husband over the phone. She promises to not boss him around once she passes on and joins him in the afterlife.

12,"This seems to be a fan favorite among most, and I used to like it, but I always felt like something was a little off about it. Now, I know what's wrong with it. As a kid, I accepted it without questioning it, passing it off as a simple story about an alien invasion with a killer punchline. Now, though, I know just how corny and awful it is. It's a good episode in its own right, but trust me, once you see the source material, you'll get why I hate it.

I saw a book a while back called The Best of Damon Knight. It was from 1976, and I usually don't buy sci-fi books, but I noticed it had about 20 different stories in there, so I got it. There was an introduction about this guy, Damon Knight, and he was born in Oregon, I guess, and he opens each story with a small introduction and then goes on. The stories, I noticed, were very satirical in nature. Which is to say, they were allegories, not intended to be taken seriously. I noticed that one of them was called ""To Serve Man"". I was intrigued. I thought maybe it had something to do with the Twilight Zone episode. As it turns out, it does. Rod Serling ripped the story wholesale off this poor guy. Sure, he paid him, so it's legal, but he messed up the core message of the whole thing.

The story beats the episode in a lot of ways. For one, the story is funny. Dark humor, sure, but humor nonetheless. Damon Knight wrote lots of funny and inventive sci-fi stories. They're all just big jokes. ""Backward, O Time"" is so funny it should be made into a comedy movie. Anyway, the episode is treated so heavy handed that, when trying to discern the true meaning of the whole thing, I thought it was a metaphor for Communism. Turns out it's not a metaphor for Communism- it's really just a story about aliens that cook people, according to Damon Knight.

In To Serve Man, the story, the Kanamits look like pigs. And it's funny, and it makes a statement, because, you know- pigs eating people. Funny, right? As a  metter of fact, on the cover of my Damon Knight book, there's a drawing of two Kanamits looking at a book, written in some ancient language, presumably- and they look like they were taken out of a cartoon, with Teletubbie-type overalls. In the episode, they aren't even slightly laughable in appearance. Instead of being little pig people, they're tall, morbid guys that look like Lurch from The Addams Family. Their image as it was supposed to be was ruined forever by this one show.

The next thing that gets me is the characters. In the episode, there's a guy, and he works for the United Nations. Same with the story. But in the story, he's a bachelor. In the episode, he has a girlfriend, a love interest, who's completely unnecessary- her only reason is to say the punchline at the end. In the story, he has this friend. And this friend, I think, is absolutely essential. In the story, the friend talks about how he suspects that the Kanamits have ulterior motives, and how nobody would solve all world hunger and war if they didn't want something in return. This one friend of the protagonist makes the story a lot more believable. In the episode, they don't even bother to check the Kanamits out. They just go right ahead and start letting them fix everything. This friend, in the story, who's completely absent in the episode- gives a different viewpoint, and shows that, in a case like this, where freakin' ALIENS arrive on Earth, some people would be skeptical about them.  In the episode, they don't even make a fuss. That friend makes everything more realistic. MOST of the human race can be stupid and give in- just not ALL. 

And the ending bugs me. In the story, when the friend says the punchline, they're not about to abducted and captured- they're talking things over in a restaurant, so they still have time to stop the aliens and get their planet back. In the episode his love interest says the punchline when they close the door over him and he dies no matter what. In the story, you nervously chuckle. In the episode, you just groan. 

In short, the Twilight Zone is normally praised for it inventive twists- and people always seem to really praise the twist in this one- although that praise isn't deserved, since Rod Serling never even came up with it to begin with. I highly prefer the Damon Knight version, and I'd suggest you read it, too, and see which one you prefer. It's a good twist, but Damon Knight came up with it, and he should have been able to execute it the way he saw fit. That's all I have to say. ",Iamnotthethe,"I don't like ""To Serve Man"".",1523298783,21,True,TwilightZone,2018-04-09
13,"This episode is highly overrated. Everybody knows it. It's regarded as a pioneer of the post apocalyptic genre and an episode with a stunning, never to be expected twist. But what I don't like about it is that it doesn't make any sense, and nobody seems to get that.

First off, I love Burgess Meredith. I have nothing against him. His acting in this is great. Top notch. I liked him in the one where he's holed up in his apartment and he's forced to die because he likes books. That one's great. He's also good as Penguin. He's actually the only villain I like on Batman. His rendition of Penguin is incredible. Best Penguin portrayal ever. I don't like Danny DeVito. He just can't beat Burgy. So this review isn't directed towards Burgess. It's based on the plot.

WE open the episode in a bank, where Burgess is reading a book. His boss comes up and says that he stinks as a person and he shouldn't read so much David Copperfield. He tells him that he sucks at his job and if he keeps reading dumb books then he'll be fired. After that, he goes home, and tries to relax, but his vain, screaming wife tells him that his books suck. She vandalizes them, throws them in the trash, tears the pages out. He begs her not to, but she mentally assaults him and threatens to get a divorce.  

So then, Mr. Bemis, like any sane person would do, goes down to the bank vault to read alone, away from the jerks who pick on him for being a nerdy, literary guy. The bomb goes off, and he goes outside, and he thinks, ""Oh, wow. I'm free from my stupid boss and my nagging wife. Yay."" So he goes around in the rubble, and he gets to a library, and he's about to read forever and enjoy his life forever, and then he breaks his glasses. That's it. End of episode. Fade to black. 

What people fail to notice is that the moral is HORRIBLY SKEWED. The whole episode, I feel nothing but pity for him. Why do his glasses break? That's not justice, that's frickin' torture! What is the moral? That a guy can't read books peacefully if he wants to? That he should have been NICE to his fat boss and his evil, yelling wife?  That he should have been a soulless conformist? This episode is just sad. The episode should just end when his wife and boss get killed- there. Justice served! The moral could be: Don't be mean to poor Burgess Meredith when he just wants to read! Can't he be an introvert if he wants to be an introvert?

Nope. I don't get the moral here.

I don't get it. The Obsolete man, the other one he's in, praises the use of books. This one seems to be anti book. That's pretty contradictory. 

Here's how I think the whole episode could be improved: They made his wife and boss complete jerks and made him a sweet, completely likeable, sympathetic character. If they were going to make the moral that he shouldn't have been such a bookworm, then that's fine. They just need to make HIM the bad guy. Maybe his boss could have said that the business was failing, that he had built the bank out of the ground with his bare hands, and Bemis is so lost in his book that he's worth as much as a statue. Then Mr. Bemis could throw the book in his boss's face and say, ""F you"". The episode doesn't make him a jerk. It makes him a cuddly nerd.

In the next scene, his wife could come home, and beg for him to pay a little more attention to her, and he could push her aside and go over to his armchair and read and not listen to her, and be a total asshat. That would give a reason for him to break his glasses. But freak, she's as likable and charismatic as Norman Bates. I don't sympathize with HER. I sympathize with HIM. That's what this episode does wrong. People bully this guy, and then he gets ""Justice"" for no reason. I don't get it.

Also, the ""problem"" isn't even THAT bad. It seems incredibly easy to fix. Earlier in the episode, he finds an abandoned gas station, finds some potato chips, crunches one, and says, ""I won't starve"". COULDN'T HE FIND SOME GLASSES? Some glasses that were shatter-resistant, or in good packaging? Or, he could go and find some crazy glue and try to fix his glasses- I mean, they're just glasses. They're probably not the last glasses on Earth. if he could find some potato chips, he could feel around for some glasses. RIGHT?

Everybody seems to like this one, and I tend to question unanimous decisions. Some have even gone so far as to call this one the best episode of ALL TIME, like this guy, here, who put it at the top of his top 10 list:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2kOSuz2VZM

To begin, the concept is brilliant, very brilliant. Kudos to the TZ people for coming up with a concept like this. It was desperately needed at a time when beauty was highly overrated and most magazine ads were for beauty products. I just think it was poorly executed, is all. The makeup is good, the dialogue is good. My problem with the episode, I guess, depends on the way it was executed. I'll start off with the most obvious problem when running a story like this. 

Namely, the problem is that none of the doctors, or nurses, can show their faces. You might think that this seems rather obvious, as their faces have to stay hidden until the big reveal. And it's true, their faces DO have to stay hidden. And that, right there, is the problem. We never see their faces until they get revealed. That's why this episode isn't very good. WE, as an audience, know something is WRONG with their faces. Even if we've never seen the episode before, we KNOW that something is being hidden, that there must be some REASON for obscuring their faces. No other Twilight Zone episode has all the characters walk around with their faces obscured in shadow. That's why I feel the twist doesn't work. Good twists have to take you by surprise. Like the one with the guy on the boat who's the good version of the evil Nazi guy and he tries to warn everybody on the ship but they're all ghosts and so on. That one has a good twist. Or the one with the guy who can stop time with his watch but breaks the watch when he's robbing a  bank. Those are good twists. Or the one where the guy asks the psychic salesman for too many things and he gives him a set of shoes and he gets run over by them. THOSE are good twists. You never see them coming. This one, though- you can see a twiss of some kind, involving their faces, from a mile away. It would ruin the twist to show their faces, but it ruins the twist to hide their faces, too. It's a loss either way. That's the problem with this story.

A few more problems. Before the big reveal, the script has to fill about a half an hour, so the doctors and the nurses talk about things for a while. The problem with their dialogue is that it isn't even very subtle. We're supposed to assume that the hospital is just a normal hospital treating a lady with some kind of facial disfigurement. But there are lots of points in the doctor's dialogue where we feel like something is a little off. Like, for instance, the doctor says, ""I wish these ugly people could just live among us!"" And the nurse says, ""Oh, no, don't say that, you'll be accused of treason."" Right from those two lines, a bright viewer will catch that, not only are people not ALLOWED to be ugly in this world, but FREE SPEECH is illegal, and you can't THINK about progress, or nonconformity! This is clearly an Orwellian society, and I just don't know why, when a plot relies so heavily on the viewer perceiving the hospital as a normal hospital, there are so many dead giveaways. 

Another dead giveaway comes when the nurse says, ""It's time for the LEADER'S MANDATORY SPEECH"". Not the PRESIDENT, even, just the LEADER. Doesn't that sound a lot like Big Brother? Only an idiot would think that the place is a normal hospital at this point. Then, the nurse pushes a button, and this HOLOGRAPHIC VIEWING SCREEN pops up on the wall. Not a normal TV, no, but a HOLOGRAPHIC VIEWING SCREEN! This is clearly in the future! We can see everything from a mile away! maybe, before the big reveal, they could just talk about, I dunno, normal doctor stuff. That would hide the fact that the hospital isn't a normal hospital.

My last problem with this episode might seem a little picky, but it's one line, in the script. The Nurse is in the room, and she's talking to the lady with the facial disfigurement, and the lady says, ""Nurse, how much longer do I have to go around looking like a PIG?"" Now, this seems normal, it's a common insult for an ugly person. But think about it for a moment. EVERY PERSON in this society looks a lot like a PIG. It doesn't matter that the pig people are considered beautiful. Regardless of what the standards of beauty are at this particular moment, I think even most Pig People would agree that THEY LOOK MORE LIKE PIGS THAN THE NORMAL PEOPLE. So PIG, therefore, would be a COMPLIMENT, not an INSULT. I don't know what to make of this line. It confuses everything. Do PIGS look like HUMANS in this world? Who knows? The scriptwriters should have been more careful with what the characters said, is all. 

Anyway, that's what I have to say about this episode. It could have been good if they had put a little more thought into it. Good message, I like the message, and the twist, and the moral.

0,"I've heard that some people hate this one. I'm not sure their hatred is meaningful, however. It is one of my all-time favorite episodes, and I think I might be able to shed a little light on why I favor it so much.

First off, it's a very creative way of dealing with the whole time travel thing. I think it should be put in the top 10 list of all the time travel TV episodes. The turn of the century was a time when time travel was just starting to be accepted as a novel concept- so taking a man from 1890 and placing him in 1960 is a neat idea. Sure, the time machine looks nuts, but that's because in 1890 things were made out of cardboard and tape. Mulligan is a fellow who's forced to cope with the present- and he copes with it in the most hilarious ways possible. 

The realism. If I saw the first part, I couldn't tell it wasn't a real movie. Rod Serling made this at a time before silent movie software was available- and he does a good job of it. The soundtrack is good, too- changing just at the right moments to give just the right feeling. The ways in which the format is played around with are creative too- when Mulligan blows on the harmonica and falls into the pig pen, in particular. And let's not forget the tremendous efforts that were made to make a street look like it came from 1890- they bought chickens and penny farthings to make it look top notch. Heck, they even bought signs. When he goes to 1960, the format changes, and you feel all the wind knocked out of you. Then, it switches back, and you get a rush of nostalgia.

The gags. This episode isn't like a normal Twilight Zone episode, and that's a good thing, because it provides a dose of comic relief to contrast with the gritty, dark feeling of the other ones. What I think most critics of this episode don't get is that The Twilight Zone isn't meant to be a horror show. It's just a bunch of moral dilemmas played out for fun. What-if scenarios. Normal people put into weird, kooky situations. This is an episode where your Average Joe is put into a weird situation and reacts to it- he just reacts to it in a more humorous way. This is not a scary episode, so don't look at it as a scary episode. Look at it as funny, and it'll seem better. I like how Mulligan sees the signs and notices that inflation's a reality. I like how he talks to the TV when he sees it. If you don't like it, then you're looking for dark themes where there are none. 

Buster, for one. Buster Keaton is a master of the art- and in this episode, in his elderly age, he displays his talent. It's like watching new Adam Sandler movie 15 years since he made another one. I bet the viewers enjoyed it. They could have just hired anybody to play the grumpy janitor- but they got HIM. Do you know what this episode was like? It was like the new Star Wars! 

It's quirky, but it's golden. It's the story of a guy who wasn't content enough with his own time and then decided that he hated the future even more. it's funny. If you hate it, then you've never gotten a good kick out of anything before. ",Iamnotthethe,"In defense of ""Once Upon A Time"".",1522193216,15,True,TwilightZone,2018-03-27

4,"This episode never gets talked about much, and I can see why. I like both Rod Serling and Ray Bradbury, don't get me wrong. They're both geniuses in their own right. But the first time I saw this, I wondered what was going on, because I knew that Ray Bradbury had written a story called I Sing the Body Electric. Turns out, the episode's actually based on that story. And Ray wrote the screenplay himself. This is my problem with it: it's not supposed to be there. Ray Bradbury was not meant for film or TV. HGis words are his greatest power, the way his pen breathes life onto the paper. One of his stories cannot be expressed within the short space of a half hour. With this episode, the story, which I'm sure was wonderful to begin with, becomes a simple-minded bore. There's a dad, and he had three kids, and they hire this robot from some robot agency to help them live their lives and then the robot lady leaves. That's literally IT. No moral like there usually is, no twist, nothing. It's like a bad Mary Poppins ripoff or something. In addition, the plot is absurd, since it's set in the present day and they didn't HAVE robot making places back then, much less now. There's nothing controversial about it like Rod always does, but there's nothing cool about it like Ray always does. The most it comes to being intriguing is when there's a small amount of conflict in the dull family and one of the daughters gets run over by a car, but then, in some form of deus ex machina, she's brought back to life. I've never read the source material, I'll admit, but I bet it was a lot better in short story form than in half-hour TV show form. It's creepy and dull. Ray Bradbury and Rod Serling, I think, weren't meant to mix. The only other nod to Bradbury I know of is the alien mystery one in the restaurant, where the crazy old Grandpa guy(Who serves as a form of comic relief but also as a prime suspect), when asked about aliens, responds to the absurdity of the question by saying, ""It's like somethin' outta Ray BADbury!"" And that IS funny, because he mispronounces Bradbury's name. That's a good way of acknowledging Ray. I dunno, maybe another one of his stories could have been adapted, one with more complexity to it. Maybe I Sing the Body Electric WAS complex and it was watered down for television format. I dunno. Maybe The Twilight Zone could have had one of his Martian Chronicles, or one of his stories from Green Town, or something like that. I just don't like this episode. It's a bad episode.

6,"I've heard a lot about trying to discern what's the best ever Twilight Zone episode. That's what I consider an impossible feat, because they're all competent. But I'm a critic, and I've seen a few which bear scrutinization. After running them all over in my head. I think I've discovered the worst ever Twilight Zone episode ever produced. Tell me if you agree. 

The worst episode I'm referring to, of course, is episode 7 of season 3. The Grave. If you watch it once, you might think it was a masterpiece, but you know why I think it's a piece of garbage? It's ripped off an urban legend that's been played out through the years a gazillion times. I watch The Twilight Zone because each and every plot is original. Rod's mind was a whirling powerhouse of inventive twists and allegories and so on. Before the Twilight Zone was made, There was no story about a lady who gets a call from her dead son or a suburban neighborhood that turns grotesque after a phony bomb threat. And I can accept the corny ones, like the one where Burgess Meredith gets the power of super strength from a two headed alien, or the dark, gritty ones, like the one about the man who takes three of his enemies down to his basement and tries to test their cowardice. But I can't stand this one episode because Rod put no effort into it. He looked in a book of scary ghost stories, picked this one out, and thought, ""Heck, I'll do this."" That's why this one gets me.

The urban legend that this one rips off is a classic that everyone knows- but it can be set in a variety of settings, and it can be claimed as fact, even though it happens under impossible circumstances. For some unexplained reason, Rod decided to set it in the Old West- although, to be honest, he could have just as easily set in on Neptune. Not that his Old West ones aren't good. I like when The Twilight Zone takes a jaunt out to the desert. It was a neat way to connect with the most popular genre of the time- the Western, and Rod really was pretty creative with all of it. ""Showdown with Rance McGrew,"" in particular, is a real laugh-fest- and I like it because it dared to question the historical accuracy of the old showdown shows. I hate this episode, though. Rod thought that, by switching the setting to the Old West, he could make it seem original, and by putting in some cheap characters and a decent script, he could escape cancellation. But I can see through it all, and every time I watch this episode, I like Roddy a little less. He could have thought up something mediocre that week, just so long as he didn't put this sleaze on the air. No creativity, really.

We open the episode by hearing that there's been a big showdown in the town, and Pinto Sykes, the vicious outlaw, has been killed. This is tricky, deceitful way to open. It sounds intriguing, and the viewer thinks something interesting is going to happen. Soon, a beefcake enters the local saloon, on a spooky night, of course- we can hear the wind blowing all SPOOKILY outside just to tell us that it's all CREEPY. Right? So this guy comes in, and they shoot the works for a while, chat it up over a few shots of whiskey. Really, this part is just filler. I'd say that the original urban legend could be told in its entirety in about two minutes, but of course Rod has to stretch it out for half an hour, so they talk about what a jerk Pinto was and how his death is controversial and whatnot. It saddens me to think that they wasted time writing a script for this.  If it had an original plot, this patter might be necessary. After a while, we get to the part where the rip-off really begins. One of the guys says, ""Hey, if yore really a tuff cowboy like ya sez ya are, then go down to thet thar grave an' stick this hyar knife inta his grave!"" Or something like that. The tough beefcake cowboy, of course, accepts the bet, and goes down to the graveyard. On the way, he encounters this weird lady who's there for no reason- she talks more ominously than Morticia in The Addams family, and I guess she's the relative of Pinto, or something like that. So the cowboy goes down there, and he tries to stick the knife down, and he does, but then when he tries to walk away, he falls down, pulled by some unseen force, and then the camera cuts back to the saloon. The cowboys realize that Mr. Hunk Cowboy hasn't come back yet, so they go down to the grave and check it out. He's dead. Like in the original urban legend, one of the cowboys points down to the corpse and says that the guy had stuck the knife into his coat by mistake, and when he got up and felt the knife tuck in his coat, he thought it was the dead guy's hands pulling on him and he had a heart attack and died. Same explanation I've heard so many times that I've gotten tired of it by now. Then, in one last desperate attempt to make the episode original, the creepy lady points out that the WIND was blowing last night so that his coat wouldn't have been over the grave, and the wind is still the same way tonight, and so it WAS the dead guy after all! OOOOOOH! Except for the fact that the wind easily could have shifted at any point during the night, and it's the weakest point that anybody could have come up with. This is Rod trying at the last minute to make it more interesting, but it's so pathetic that it ends up being tiresome and pointless. The original urban legend, to begin with, has so many plotholes that it doesn't make for a good Twilight Zone episode. If a person has the guts to enter a fricking graveyard and stick a knife into a grave, then they probably won't have a heart attack when they feel a little tugging on their coat. Wouldn't somebody be able to tell the difference between a knife and a fricking DEAD HAND? Anyway, this episode is very poorly done, and it makes me sad to see Rod resorting to something as cheap as this. If you don't read the urban legend first, it seems OK, but it loses its value the minute you realize just how hackneyed it is.

Opening Narration 
&gt; *What you're looking at is a ghost, once alive but now deceased. Once upon a time, it was a baseball stadium that housed a major league ball club known as the Hoboken Zephyrs. Now it houses nothing but memories and a wind that stirs in the high grass of what was once an outfield, a wind that sometimes bears a faint, ghostly resemblance to the roar of a crowd that once sat here. We're back in time now, when the Hoboken Zephyrs were still a part of the National League, and this mausoleum of memories was an honest-to-Pete stadium. But since this is strictly a story of make believe, it has to start this way: once upon a time, in Hoboken, New Jersey, it was tryout day. And though he's not yet on the field, you're about to meet a most unusual fella, a left-handed pitcher named Casey.*




Closing Narration
&gt; *Once upon a time, there was a major league baseball team called the Hoboken Zephyrs, who, during the last year of their existence, wound up in last place and shortly thererafter wound up in oblivion. There's a rumor, unsubstantiated, of course, that a manager named McGarry took them to the West Coast and wound up with several pennants and a couple of world championships. This team had a pitching staff that made history. Of course, none of them smiled very much, but it happens to be a fact that they pitched like nothing human. And if you're interested as to where these gentlemen came from, you might check under 'B' for Baseball - in The Twilight Zone.*

4,"Which episodes bring out the contrarian in you? Where you go contrary to the common mainstream perception. 

I don’t care for Long Distance Call or Its A Good Life as much. In both episodes, I find the main character to be manipulative in an annoying way. The grandmother is too selfish in tying to make Billy go with him in her death, and the child was evil in It’s A Good Life. 

I also don’t like The Howling Man that much either. The storyline itself is intruiging, but the episode is just kind of depressing to me. Also, the howling sound is like nails on a chalkboard. 

I really like Showdown with Rance McGrew. I find it a lighthearted comedy, almost in a Three Stooges way. It’s supposed to be so silly that you can’t help but laugh and giggle at certain scenes. 

Similar sentiments with Once Upon A Time. Charming, old school slapstick comedy.

**Plot** - A woman is treated badly by some odd salespeople on an otherwise empty department store floor. [IMDB]


Opening Narration 
&gt; *Express elevator to the ninth floor of a department store, carrying Miss Marsha White on a most prosaic, ordinary, run-of-the-mill errand. Miss Marsha White on the ninth floor, specialties department, looking for a gold thimble. The odds are that she'll find it—but there are even better odds that she'll find something else, because this isn't just a department store. This happens to be The Twilight Zone.*




Closing Narration
&gt; *Marsha White, in her normal and natural state, a wooden lady with a painted face who, one month out of the year, takes on the characteristics of someone as normal and as flesh and blood as you and I. But it makes you wonder, doesn't it, just how normal are we? Just who are the people we nod our hellos to as we pass on the street? A rather good question to ask . . . particularly in the Twilight Zone.*

Opening Narration 
&gt; *This is Gart Williams, age thirty-eight, a man protected by a suit of armor all held together by one bolt. Just a moment ago, someone removed the bolt, and Mr. Williams' protection fell away from him and left him a naked target. He's been cannonaded this afternoon by all the enemies of his life. His insecurity has shelled him, his sensitivity has straddled him with humiliation, his deep-rooted disquiet about his own worth has zeroed in on him, landed on target, and blown him apart. Mr. Gart Williams, ad agency exec, who in just a moment, will move into the Twilight Zone—in a desperate search for survival.*




Closing Narration

Maybe it's wishful thinking nestled in a hidden part of a man's mind, or maybe it's the last stop in the vast design of things—or perhaps, for a man like Mr. Gart Williams, who climbed on a world that went by too fast, it's a place around the bend where he could jump off.

I want to include that I think this stands for rewatching episodes you’ve seen too. For example when I rewatched “it’s a good life” just the other day, I accidentally skimmed the summary and remembered the strange powers the child possesses. This totally ruined the experience of that episode because the best part of the suspense is that you don’t really have a handle on what is going on with the boy and everyone he’s involved with.

Most episodes are psychological, haunting, and best watched alone in the dark, but this episode is completely different, and I'm curious if there are other episodes with a similar, lighthearted tone. 

For those who need a refresher, it stars Burgess Meredith as a timid, vacuum seller who becomes an experiment to an invisible two-headed alien and gains super human strength. The aliens, Meredith's performance, and the entire plot gave it an unexpected, welcomed change in tone that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Is it some cosmic occurrence that bleeds into our world? Or is it us who leave our universe and into a parallel one where these strange events unfold? Can these rifts somehow be triggered?

Anyway.

Happy family finds out they cannot leave their house (the windows were either completely black or bricked). It ends with them digging in the cellar and banging against a metal surface with some sort of design on it - at the time I didn't recognize it and I thought it was meant to mean that it was a toy house

In my memory it is linked to the remake of ""a kind of stopwatch"" that, I think, was aired as A little peace and quiet, so maybe it's the same period?

And it is also linked to the short segment of the old lady working on a jigsaw puzzle at night, forming the figure of herself in her house at that moment, and a man entering from the window - which I also would like to see again ^^

Opening Narration 
&gt; *Her name is the S.S. Queen of Glasgow. Her registry: British. Gross tonnage: five thousand. Age: Interdeterminate. At this moment she's one day out of Liverpool, her destination New York. Duly recorded on the ship's log is the sailing time, course to destination, weather conditions, temperature, longitude and latitude. But what is never recorded in a log is the fear that washes over a deck like fog and ocean spray. Fear like the throbbing strokes of engine pistons, each like a heartbeat, parceling out of every hour into breathless minutes of watching, waiting and dreading... For the year is 1942, and this particular ship has lost its convoy. It travels alone like an aged blind thing groping through the unfriendly dark, stalked by unseen periscopes of steel killers. Yes, the Queen of Glasgow is a frightened ship, and she carries with her a premonition of death.*




Closing Narration

This is what is meant by paying the fiddler. This is the comeuppance awaiting every man when the ledger of his life is opened and examined, the tally made, and then the reward or the penalty paid. And in the case of Carl Lanser, former Kapitan Lieutenant, Navy of the Third Reich, this is the penalty. This is the justice meted out. This is judgment night in the Twilight Zone.*

This is a cheap man, a nickel-and-dime man, with a cheapness that goes past the suit and the shirt; a cheapness of mind, a cheapness of taste, a tawdry little shine on the seat of his conscience, and a dark-room squint at a world whose sunlight has never gotten through to him. But Mr. Hammer has a talent, discovered at a very early age. This much he does have. He can make his face change. He can twitch a muscle, move a jaw, concentrate on the cast of his eyes, and he can change his face. He can change it into anything he wants. Mr. Archie Hammer, jack-of-all-trades, has just checked in at three-eighty a night, with two bags, some newspaper clippings, a most odd talent, and a master plan to destroy some lives.*

**""Where Is Everybody""**


**Written by** - Rod Serling


**Directed by** - Robert Stevens


**Plot** - Mike Ferris finds himself alone in the small Oakwood town and without recollection about his name, where he is or who he is. Mike wanders through the town trying to find a living soul. The tension increases and Mike has a breakdown. [IMDB]


Opening Narration 
&gt; *The place is here. The time is now, and the journey into the shadows that we are about to watch, could be our journey.*




Closing Narration
&gt; *The barrier of loneliness: The palpable, desperate need of the human animal to be with his fellow man. Up there, up there in the vastness of space, in the void that is the sky, up there is an enemy known as isolation. It sits there in the stars waiting, waiting with the patience of eons, forever waiting ... in The Twilight Zone.*

15,"The ending is a ""10"" -- absolutely brilliant. However, the rest of the episode rates a ""6"" or ""5"" for me at best. Too often, owing to Moorehead's uneven central performance mostly, but to pacing issues as well, it feels clunky. Which is not to say, mind you, that everything before the reveal is ineffectual: the score is top notch and so is the moody cinematography. I applaud the innovativeness of this piece of TV-- after all how many shows from that period would forego dialogue and tell their entire story through visuals and music (well, there is some dialogue at the end). I just wish the rest of the episode was as good as its ending ... because truly if that had been the case is would probably be ""TZ""'s crowning achievement.

**Plot** - A pitchman is visited by Death and is forced to get his priorities in order. [IMDB]


Opening Narration 
&gt; *Street scene: Summer. The present. Man on a sidewalk named Lou Bookman, age sixtyish. Occupation: pitchman. Lou Bookman, a fixture of the summer, a rather minor component to a hot July, a nondescript, commonplace little man whose life is a treadmill built out of sidewalks. And in just a moment, Lou Bookman will have to concern himself with survival – because as of three o'clock this hot July afternoon, he'll be stalked by Mr. Death.*




Closing Narration
&gt; *Louis J. Bookman, age sixtyish. Occupation: pitchman. Formerly a fixture of the summer, formerly a rather minor component to a hot July. But, throughout his life, a man beloved by the children, and therefore, a most important man. Couldn't happen, you say? Probably not in most places – but it did happen in the Twilight Zone.*

3,"This really happened.  The wife had a bad night of sleep and woke me up at about 2am the day before Halloween about two weeks ago, and you know how you remember dreams clearly if you wake up suddenly?  That happened to me.  

Here’s the weird part, my dream was a complete, full-length, black-and-white version of the 1960s Twilight Zone.  Not a dream about an episode that I’ve seen, but rather a brand-new episode concocted entirely by my subconscious.  Almost right away the next morning I started telling people about it and my wife in particular encouraged me to write it down.

I didn’t wake up in the middle of the episode and decided to finish it, I dreamt the whole damn thing start to finish.  And was woken up at the exact moment it ended.

My dream had Nazis in it.  I’m going to write about Nazis.  f you think for a minute I condone Nazis or hate you are dead wrong – and I think my values are pretty well reflected by my dream.  Before you react to this post *please read to the very end*.  If you are a Nazi or a racist and you feel a need to reply, don’t.  I’ll ignore you and your dead ideology.  

They say men don’t dream dialogue but women do.  I can’t say either way.  I don’t recall distinct words or conversations, just mostly thoughts, scenes, and concepts.  I did embellish my dream with the opening and closing narratives Rod Serling-style that matches my impression in the dream of knowing the setting and implications of the story.  I also made up a title to match my dream.

I’ve also heard that men dream in black and white.  Not too sure about that since I’ve had colorful dreams.  This dream though was completely black and white, just like the old Twilight Zone series.  

I don’t think a story like this would hold up today. But, compared to Twilight Zone episodes (which I’ve since researched – I never saw them before my dream) like “Death’s Head Revisited,” and “He’s Alive,” I think it holds up pretty well.  I have seen plenty of Star Trek stories with Nazis in them.  This story is similar to Man in a High Castle but not in a contemporary sense, everyone in my dream really talked and acted like they did in the original Twilight Zone.  

I’m also not a writer, I’m an engineer.  I have no idea how to write a screenplay.  So, I’ll write this as an outline like a Wikipedia episode summary.  

Oh, and I apologize this isn’t a particularly scary Twilight Zone, even though I dreamt it up pretty close to Halloween.  

Here it goes:

“Living History”
Opening Scene:  An outdoor museum similar to Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, with wood fencing, horses, and people in costumes, and school children bustling about.  But the cameras pull back and reveal tanks, Nazi flags, soldiers, and statues.  Visitors, children, and staff alike wearing Nazi armbands.

Opening Narration:
“Picture an America, a lovely field in Pennsylvania, but not an America or the Pennsylvania we know today.  No, this America succumbed to the Nazi hordes in the Second World War, and now lives as a subjugated people of the far larger empire of the Third Reich, and the bitter memories of this war have long faded.  In this America lies a museum, a living history museum on the site of the last battle of that conflict where her last hope was extinguished. The visitors to this museum come from far and wide to learn about the Master Race’s victory over the feeble democracy-loving Allies.  What the visitors, workers, and administrators of this museum will soon come to find out, some candles and flames cannot be so easily extinguished…in the Twilight Zone.”

Plot Summary:
The museum is in full swing on a busy day.  Located somewhere in Pennsylvania, the staff put on a show for visitors like a living history museum.  There are horse rides, tanks, fake uniforms, and weapons, and a few old-fashioned wood fences near some WWII trenches.  

There is even a pit where Nazi children can come and stomp on an American Flag, and several are there stomping away with many more lined up behind them.

[note:  no it kind of doesn’t make sense that a horse would be in a WWII museum, but there was definitely a horse in my dream and played a big role.]

The museum staff is quite large with quite a few workers but the Nazi administrators are pretty bored and disinterested, except when they are giving orders.  The museum really isn’t being run all that well, Nazis clearly looking forward to the future and not spending much time keeping the place up.  The horse ride is a disaster, the road to the museum is a mess, and the place is generally completely run down.

Our story starts with a person I felt was an Affable American Loser.  He didn’t get a name in my dream, so I’ll call him “AL” for short.  He is the youngest and lowliest member of the staff, in charge of horse rides.  When the supervisors aren’t around he makes all sorts of jokes with his fellow staff, who advise him to keep it down or else he’ll get in trouble.

A Nazi Supervisor, an American but in a Nazi uniform, is dressing him down for not following orders to give all the children rides before the day is over.  He complains that the horse is overworked, and hasn’t had enough hay and water.  

The Nazi supervisor isn’t having it.  He becomes outraged, denies Al’s request for more hay and water, and insists that he fills his ride quota as ordered.  He explains (or shouts) that he has been ordered to maintain the museum in an orderly and efficient manner in accordance with the tenets of National Socialism. There is a grand inspection tomorrow evening, and he insists everything be working at peak efficiency – or else.  With that, he stomps off.  
That evening, when putting the horse away, Al gets separated from his other workers and discovers a back door to the prop and supply room, normally off limits.  He pauses to admire a Nazi general’s uniform.  In the supply room he finds a basket of apples and secrets them out near the kid’s horse ride area.

The next day Al has his horse ride operation running at peak efficiency, thanks to the apples he is secretly feeding his horse.  The Nazi Supervisor comes by and notes the better operation.  He still holds a grudge from yesterday’s debacle, and moves on without acknowledging Al’s work.  After he leaves a messenger arrives with a message for the Nazi Supervisor.  The messenger states that the head Nazi General administrator has been delayed for several days.  Al, being mischievous, tells the messenger he’s a trusted senior member of the museum staff and he’ll convey the message personally to the Supervisor.  The messenger leaves, and Al pulls an apple out of his pocket, starts juggling it in the air, and whistles.  He clearly isn’t going to deliver the message.

That evening, Al sneaks back into the prop room to get more apples.  On his way out he again admires the general’s uniform – this time he decides to try it on.  After putting on a fake mustache and monocle, his is nearly completely indistinguishable from his former self.

But, as he is putting on his last goose-stepping boot he leans up against a wall – that turns out to be a door to a conference room!

Straightening up he sees the Museum and local Nazi administrators all lined up at a conference table.  Seeing him they snap to attention and salute – “Heil Hitler!”

After a few stunned moments Al realizes he needs to fake his way out of this situation.  He decides to vent his frustration of working at the museum.

[Note:  Al fakes a pretty good German accent.  I just can’t write one that well.]

“You call this a museum?  Look at this place!  The attractions are barely functional, the staff lazy, this place is a mess, and the road coming in is a disaster!  This place is a disgrace to National Socialism!  I order that the roads repaired immediately, animals fed, clean-up crews established, etc. etc.  I order you to make this place run like a well-oiled Nazi machine!”

The Supervisor sputters, “but…sir, we have not been ordered before to do any of these things.”

The ‘General’ replies, “Well, YOU’VE BEEN ORDERED NOW!  THINK OF WAYS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND GET TO WORK!”  After a few moments of stunned silence, Al says “DISMISSED!”

At that word, the Nazis in the conference room scramble out the door to enact the fake General’s orders.  Al waits just a bit, then hurries back to the prop room to change back as fast as he can.  He emerges to find the Supervisor barking orders at the museum staff, empowering them to make as many changes as possible.  

Al comes out of the prop room just in time.  The Supervisor starts to chastise him for not being at his duty station, but the horse comes by with a happy child on its back.  The Supervisor leaves without another note.  Some of Al’s fellow museum workers give him knowing glances, showing that some of them likely know about Al’s biggest trick ever.

A key beat is when the Supervisor insists that the museum staff think for themselves making the museum run more efficiently.  The Supervisor pauses for just a moment, not quite understanding the implications of what he is ordering people to do.

Flash forward a few days, the museum is running at its highest efficiency ever.  The road is fixed, people are very happy to be there, and the trash is picked up.  A visible transformation has occurred.  Al has become a leader of this effort, and the Nazi American Supervisor has grown to appreciate him.

At the museum’s conference room, the gathered Administrators, which now include Al himself, are congratulating themselves and discussing at great length what else could be fixed.  Having gotten the museum up and running smoothly they are looking at their surrounding towns and villages and start making suggestions how to fix them, like getting trains and buses running on time to allow more visitors to the museum.

Just then, the real German Nazi General shows up.  After the usual saluting and “Heil Hitler”-ing, the General launches into a tirade.

“JUST WHAT IS GOING ON?  WHO GAVE THE ORDERS TO USE RESOURCES TO FIX THE MUSEUM!?” and so on.
The Nazi American Supervisor speaks up hesitantly, “Sir…we were just following orders to make this museum run as efficiently as –“  He gets cut off.

“WHO AUTHORIZED YOU TO MAKE THESE CHANGES?!  HOW DARE YOU WORK WITHOUT PROPER ORDERS! YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING PROPER NATIONAL SOCIALIST POLICIES” and he really starts sputtering accusations.
The assembled Administrators glare at the General.  [You know, in the way they always seemed to do in the old Twlight Zone show.  That kind of long 60’s glare that would be edited down to 0.02 seconds in a modern TV show, with the horns blaring]  

The Nazi American Supervisor grows a backbone, maybe for the first time ever.  “No sir, you are wrong.  We are following proper National Socialist values.  It is you who are out of line.  Guards, please take the General to the Officer’s quarters and hold him there.”  They do so, the General sputtering the whole way.

The Supervisor turns to his administrative staff.  After a moment of careful consideration, he speaks.

“Gentlemen, I believe what we have learned here at this museum can be a great benefit to the people of the Third Reich.  There are many inefficiencies of how our Government runs.  How do we best spread our techniques to the larger country?”

After a rapid discussion, the gathered Administrators come to an astonishing conclusion.  They realize they must take charge of the weapons at the museum, bring them back into service, and seize the local burgermeister’s office.  Then they will be able to implement changes to the trains, bus line, food supplies, quality of life, etc.  The Administrators are absolutely convinced they are acting in the best interests of National Socialism, and all excitedly rush to action.  

A revolution has started.

But a small detail comes up as they are rushing to exit the museum.  Someone calls out, “how will we distinguish ourselves from the Nazis who have lost their way?”  Some discussion ensues.  Everyone wears the Nazi armband, and everyone has the same uniforms and Nazi flags.

Then Al, standing near the back, is lightning struck by an idea.  He rushes over to the flag-stomping pit and reaches down…for the American flag.

As he grasps the staff of the tattered, torn, and beat-up stars and stripes, the museum workers and supervisors all gather around and look up to it.  

Just starting to comprehend that they haven’t been acting in the best interests of National Socialism.  
They’ve been acting in the interests of…something else

…something that has been forgotten for far too long.  A faint music plays, a memory of…

-SCENE-

Closing Narration:
“The gathered people and staff don’t quite comprehend what a profound transformation has happened in their humble, worn-down, and nearly forgotten museum.  Seeking to enact a more perfect form of National Socialism, they have learned it’s basic, intrinsic flaw. Human initiative and thought are incompatible with a system that demands strict obedience to orders above all else.  From this modest spark, a great fire of freedom has been kindled.

Granted, it is a throwback to Universal Monster movies, and the lighting, Dutch angles, and scenery-chewing acting all make you feel Bela Lugosi or Boris Karloff is just around the corner. But, couldn't it have been more than just decent homage? I think it could have -- by omitting the Howling Man's transformation at the end and keeping it ambiguous as to whether or not the guy was in fact the Devil (like Charles Beaumont did in his short story this was based on).

4," Serling making his hero a bible thumper undermines his anti-totalitarianism message. It baffles me that intelligent people like Serling were apparently blind to the ""groupthink"" and ""Big Brother"" just as present in Christianity, Islam and other faiths as they were Stalin's atheist regimes. This blindness dates ""The Obsolete Man"" and keeps it from being the hard-hitting tour-de-force Serling obviously intended it to be.
