1,"Doing a marathon here of the original series. This one had me gripped. I know it's a TV show yadda yadda, but watching John Denver play a great character rubbishing superstition only to be scared out his wits and ultimately facing his doom. 

His journey through the park, reminds me how I felt having to do it late at night so many times myself. Paranoia such a bitch. 

Amazing episode, definitely one of my favourites.",neads1,"The Jungle (S3, ep 12)",1553006234,8,True,TwilightZone,2019-03-19

5,"Picture this, if you will - a young lad in his 20's who saw brief flashes of a zone at a young age.  Scarred for life, he's now digging through the past and hits the bedrock known as The Twilight Zone.  And now I guess he goes to a lab and analyzes the mineral composition or whatever that is this review.  And I called it The Groan Zone.  What the heck is wrong with me.  Enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

I love Anthony Freemont.  I think he's a real fascinating character.  A lot of people write him off as the spoiled godlike dictator that everyone in Peaksville fears but I don't think that's totally fair.

In Jerome Bixby's original story we get to see more into Anthony's mind (as watchers of art, we have some level of mind-reading too).  Sometimes he goes into the grove and plays with the animals, bringing them nests and water and such.  At one point he cornfields (re: murders) a sleek, furry thing (ferret?) for thinking about attacking another li'l critter.  It's not out of malice, Anthony just doesn't realize that animals need to eat and they can't just expect him to materialize soy dogs or whatever.  Even when he forces a rat to eat itself, that's only because Aunt Amy doesn't like rats in the basement and he's trying to do her a favor.  He probably doesn't even realize he broke her brain.

We see some of this in Serling's adaptation as well.  It's clear he's framed more as a villain in the Twilight Zone, to bump up that spook factor.  Literally the first thing we learn about Anthony is that he's a monster.  But there's still a strange childishness to everything he does that lends a very particular brand of charm.  He makes a gopher with three heads and other funny animals.  On television night he has this little plastic dinosaur movie (with great effects too, if Odyssey of Flight 33 is anything to go off of).  He's doing the whole town a huge favor by making TV in a place without electricity.  And at some point he wonders why other kids won't play with him.  It's oddly isolating, having everybody constantly praise you and tell you how great everything is.

Basically, what I'm getting at is that Anthony is a child.  He might be an omniscient, omnipotent little mutant but he's still a child, darn it.  In the original story the fear doesn't just come from ""oh no he'll cornfield me"" so much as ""i don't know what he'll do"".  Even with good intentions he doesn't understand the full extent of his powers and how they affect people.  He likes Bill Soames.  But Bill's dog doesn't like him, so he'll just cornfield it.  And given how everyone's always enabling him, this is unlikely to change.  Rod points out one particular thing of note in the intro - he can feel every emotion.  The reason why he's so nice to the grove animals in the story is because it makes them feel good which makes him feel good.  You could even say he's an empath.  I suspect he doesn't feel a lot of genuine joy from people and has grown to expect this good fakey joy.  He might realize that something's not quite right but they seem happy and everyone reassures him how good he's being so he just rolls with it.  That's also why when he detects negative emotions he hones in on those and feels them strongly, even more so since everyone's trying to be happy all the time.

I really gotta hand it to Bill Mumy - he does a great job of creating this matter-of-fact god-emperor vibe.  Given how most child actors are he goes above and beyond to make Anthony feel smug and callous but in a way you kind of like.  He also has that thosuand-yard stare that adds to the spook factor.  He really makes the episode.  I'm glad he eventually got to go into space and build robots or whatever.  None of the other actors were terribly impressive, mostly because they're stuck on that hivemind of fear and fake smiles.  The only other characters with any semblance of personality are Aunt Amy and Dan Hollis.  Amy is a living example of how Anthony could mess up anyone, even his own family.  It's never clarified what he did to her but a vacant stare is brought up so you get the gist.  That might be why she seems less terrified of Anthony, having the audacity to complain about the heat.  During Dan's speech she reaches ever-so-slightly for a poker, implying she was thinking of stabbing the little brat but chickened out.  Even though she's not quite right, she expresses her resentment toward Anthony a little more bluntly.  Also the snow at the end is a big screw you to her, having commented on the weather earlier.  Dan's the guy who stands up to tyranny and gets gunned down immediately.  He seems petulant in a ""it's my party, i'll cry if i want to"" kind of way but the booze doesn't help.  On one hand it's like ""c'mon bro, you can't wait 'till you get home?  you've been living under this god for like six years, what's an hour or two?"" but don't forget they live in a subsistence economy.  In the story it was clear that everyone traded things around, and I don't think gramophones grow on trees.  It's implied that they'll all die eventually unless Anthony materializes some food (probably candy or something) and they can enjoy that.  In the story Dan is transformed into ""something like nothing anyone would have believed possible"".  The dan-in-the-box was all Twilight Zone.  It's the perfect balance of horrific yet childish.  We don't actually see it on screen, it's just the shadow with a brief cut to his face.  Just like how they didn't show the triplicate gopher, this is a smart touch not only because their special effects aren't great but they leave more to the imagination.  When I see that cartoonishly deranged rabbit puppet pop out of the hat in the 1983 movie I can't take anything seriously.  For what it's worth it's a funny scene filled with cheese, just not what I expected.  This also happens in the 2002 revival when old Anthony burns a hole through someone and sets them on fire.  That episode has its own share of problems but we'll leave that for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this was a real good episode that deserves its spotlight.  Some worldbuilding and the of the nuance of Anthony's character is lost from the original story but other things are added like Dan telling Anthony off that heighten the conflict and make for a more entertaining watch.  Moonglow was a good musical choice, leaving behind a nostalgic bitterness behind its cheery service.  If I'd been familiar with this I would've felt the absence of Doris Day's lovely voice.  Not a super deep one but it compels you with the fear of being subjugated by a fickle, omnipotent force to the point that you can't even have your own thoughts.  And the feeling of closeted entropy that permeates this episode is just wonderful.  Everything will rot.  Hurrah.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a random note but sometime around the end Mrs. Fremont calls Mr. Fremont ""dad"".  I can't tell if this was a mistake or if she just does this because he's Anthony's dad and the world revolves around Anthony.  His parents are never given names which is odd.  Don Keefer was great too.  I love how when he says the brandy is ""real good"" you can tell he's actually being genuine for the first time in a long time.  So uh, give this one a watch.  And read the original story too.  It's online.  For free!  And tell me if you want more of these.  Leave some comments, give your thoughts on the episode.  More to come.

29," Something I kinda love about the original Twilight Zone is just how early 60s it is. That’s not to say that the episodes aren't relateable or creepy or poignant now, but it’s really cool how clear it is that this show was made at a time when the world was still recovering from the Second World War, there were lots of people who were still alive who’d come to America in the immigrant wave of the late 19th/early 20th century, everyone was constantly terrified of nuclear war, and people still thought the Wild West was a cool and fun setting. Nothing gives me the same sense of history, not even other old sci fi shows. Both the original Star Trek and Classic Doctor Who have socio-political commentary (don’t let anyone tell you otherwise), but their protagonists are people who go to different places and have adventures, not various ordinary people who wind up in various fucked up circumstances. I really hope that Jordan Peele’s version of The Twilight Zone is able to stand the test of time and give people the same sense when they watch it 50 or 60 years from now. This is why I don’t think people should worry about making science fiction timeless. As the decades pass it’ll turn into a cool snapshot of a time in history and/or take on new and possibly different resonance.

31,"This was a TV movie from 1994 that featured two unproduced scripts. One from Richard Matheson, the other by Rod Serling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really hated the Matheson portion. A woman goes to a movie theater and sees portions of her past and future life play out. This just sucked.

&amp;#x200B;

The Rod Serling scripted episode was a lot more nuanced. It features Patrick Bergin and Jack Palance. It takes places in 1868 Boston where a Civil War-era surgeon goes to meet a man who can re-animate dead human flesh. It's a lot more interesting than that.

43,"I'm dropping the Serling shtick.  I can't keep it up.  Basically the idea is that I saw some episodes of The Twilight Zone as a child and I want to revisit it.  It's an iconic piece of television and I like that it's episodic so I can skip around.  I was a dumb kid (""One for the Angels sucks.  It's not even scary!"") so I'll find something new even in rewatches.  Also I looked up all the twists on Wikipedia because I was a dumb kid.  Hopefully those stay buried.  I'll mostly be looking at the original 60's series but never say never.  It's worth mentioning I don't have Season 4 so we'll save our Jess-Belles and Printer's Devils for later.  Browsing through the catalog, one of the episodes that made a huge impression on me was Perchance to Dream.  I remember it being terrifying, and it had a cat in it which is always good.  But this cat's out of the bag and diving feet-first into... the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

It's still spooky.  Part of that is just me being particularly spooked by funhouses and statues and all that.  Even when people say they're silly and cheesy I can't help getting spooked.  But most of the spook comes from Robert Florey's directing - I'll have to get back to some of his other episodes.  According to Charles Beaumont, Florey strove for quality and ""\[this episode\] might have been the most expensive MGM feature.""  It shows.  Right at the beginning we trail along a low-angle shot of a building, making it look powerful and imposing.  After that we cut between Edward Hall's weary face and people cycling in and out of the building, emphasizing how nerve-wracking such a trivial task is for him.  It instills a sense of anxiety and curiosity, like an opener should.  With how quick these cuts are I start to feel dizzy, there's a distinct sense of vertigo here.  In my previous review I think I gave off the impression that written stories are capable of conveying more information than television.  That's obviously not true, and this episode serves as a deep contrast to how much TV can add with shot composition, movement, and sound.  Granted I haven't read Beaumont's original story but I can't stress enough how great Florey's directing is here.

This episode plays with fear and paranoia and takes its sweet time to build up to Hall's serialized nightmares.  The fear of someone hiding in your backseat is all too real and the way it's shot really makes me anxious.  Just like the beginning we flash between Hall's panicked face and a seemingly innocuous object - you gotta go back and wonder what Hall was seeing in the building and people going through it.  Seeing the infamous eyes for the first time isn't even that spooky but I empathize so much with Hall that seeing anything in that mirror drives my heart rate up and the aftermath feels like an afterthought.  Hall is aware that this is all in his head but he can't help it - and its consequences are all too real, whether as a car crash or death itself.

This idea continues as we enter Hall's dream.  In a way, a dream is just a form of Hall's imagination, only stronger and harder to escape.  When he talks to Maya for the first time she points out that he is indeed afraid but he acknowledges that it's only a dream, not realizing how much a dream can affect him.  It's not dissimilar to how someone can try to dismiss paranoid thoughts without realizing how they're being consumed, or how others can wave off one's paranoid thoughts as something you can just think away.  Maya uses this to her advantage - it's only a dream, so why not indulge a little?  Not only into Hall's fears but also into the thrill of a funhouse, a rollercoaster, or even a courtesan.  Maya represents Hall's indulgence - whether it's into moving a painting of a sailboat or seeing something in the rear-view mirror.  An amusement park is the perfect place to feed this indulgence.  The idea isn't that Hall secretly enjoys doing this but moreso that intense danger can easily snowball from an innocuous thought.  The power of the mind is terrifying.

A low-key fear of mine is Maya's freakin' laughter.  It's there at the beginning of Hall's dream, it's there as Hall gets spooked by Maya and it's there as Hall enters and exits the funhouse.  Juxtaposing laughter with dark, unsettling imagery evokes not only that someone knows something you don't but also that they delight in your disorientation.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's time to talk about my least favorite part of the episode - the twist.  This episode didn't happen.  Hall died 3 minutes into the episode, just after he entered Dr. Rathmann's office.  It's a real Playtest.  There's always something that bothers me about these kinds of twists - it cheapens the episode a bit, basically admitting to the audience that this was all a fat load of nothing.  This episode fares better than most because thematically it's deeply ingrained in dreams as a stronger vehicle of the imagination.  Although Hall's official cause of death is ""probably a heart attack"" we see that in his mind he commits suicide - he can't handle the idea that Maya has followed him to this safe space and fears that she's going to kill him so he ends up doing it for her.

So what's my beef with the twist?  So the idea is that Hall's imagination ends up consuming him - Hall sees someone who looks like Maya and it scares him so much that he jumps out the window.  But when this is revealed to be a dream, something is lost.  It's not like in Twenty-Two where Liz experiences the terror of seeing her dream play out in real life - it would work if that were the case because Hall's paranoid dreams create dissonance with reality - the painting isn't really moving.  There's nobody in the backseat.  Hall's imagination is superseding reality.  With the twist, Hall's imagination is only superseding his imagination.  He's imagined this scenario where the receptionist looks like Maya and it's too much for him.  Of course the ending reveals that the IRL receptionist, Miss Thomas, bears a striking resemblance to Maya but that's practically irrelevant.  His dream is only referencing itself.  There's no reality to ground it.  Who's to say that both Maya's appearance in the dream within a dream and the psychiatrist dream aren't both based off of Miss Thomas?  If Shadow Play is anything to go off of, Maya's appearance might change with every dream.  Her piercing eyes are her main feature.  And you could argue that the shock of seeing Maya is what drove his heart over the edge in real life, but they barely feel connected.  The powerful fear of becoming disconnected with reality is lost completely because dreaming is a normal, commonplace thing - you're not disconnecting from reality.  I actually like the set-up - Hall's dreams are affecting him IRL from the start - not in some tenuous physiological connection but because they're forcing him to stay awake. Some have said that this is a more realistic episode but this is the part that swerves into fantasy - the idea that the dream affected him so much it killed him.  You die in a dream, you die in real life.

So why even have the twist?  Some say that Beaumont is overly indulgent in twists and I can kinda see that - it's a little cheesy in Person or Persons Unknown and A Nice Place to Visit but we have other examples like Shadow Play and Long Live Walter Jameson that don't really have twists (though the ""twist"" to the latter is pretty weak).  The main two aspects of this twist are the ideas of imagination consuming Hall's life and the dissonance between reality and imagination.  What better way to show how powerful Hall's imagination has become by putting him fully into it, through a dream, and having that kill him?  Maybe I would've liked it more if he just had vivid hallucinations and ran around completely disorientated.  But the second part is the crux of the twist - in his dream, Hall dies violently and of his own accord - he jumps out of a window, signifying his heart giving out.  But he dies peacefully in real life, without nobody realizing the trauma he's gone through.  On the one hand, I like that the Twilight Zone is acknowledging that people see, think, and feel things differently and wants us to empathize more with others but this theme isn't developed well enough.  I don't hate the twist, but I think it's kind of lame and I wouldn't go to its birthday party.  I don't always like the subtle touch but the way it's used here is decent, just not in a way I can really get behind.  And I'm totally biased against this ""genre"" of twist so if you've made it this far, take this salt with a grain of twist.  Writing this out makes me appreciate the twist more.

&amp;#x200B;

Also John Larch, who played Mr. Fremont in It's a Good Life comes back (front) as Elliott Rathmann, the psychiatrist.  Total coincidence.  I like him a lot better here, as this wry understated psychiatrist that cracks jokes about not looking like Freud.  It's interesting that he offers Hall a smoke as even then the health effects are known - of course this is all Hall's dream so we don't actually know anything about the real Rathmann.  This was probably an excuse to get him towards the window.  In fact, what little we see of Rathmann shows him as a more concerned, active figure - maybe Hall thinks of him as this droll character to help calm him down.  When Hall is explaining his strong imagination, with every one of Rathmann's reassurances Hall immediately responds with ""I know.""  At no point does Rathmann challenge Hall or give him any new information.  Hall is talking to himself.  And the smoke ends up paralleling Maya giving him a light in his dream, signifying the false sense of calm preluding the very real danger he's in.  Clever.

Hall ends up being half-right in his paranoia - falling asleep does end up killing him but not in the way he expected.  He doesn't end up dreaming in serial, back to the carnival, but rather someplace as safe and prosaic as a psychiatrist's office.  It's one thing to find something spooky in a spooky carnival but in an ordinary office?  Shock city.  Overall, this is the kind of episode where you have to be right there with the protagonist to really enjoy it.  If you aren't relating to Hall, you could easily see this episode as slowly-paced and kind of boring.  He loses me a little near the end but this is easily one of the better ""psychological thriller"" episodes of the Twilight Zone.  And I know nobody will share my gripes with the twist, so all the more reason to check it out.  This is a dream you won't want to wake up from.  Also, I forgot to talk about Richard Conte and Suzanne Lloyd's performances.  They were good.

83,"*""What is this, some sort of new-wave expression or something - saying 'dinosaur' instead of 'lunch'?""* \- Hinge Thunder

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care what Hinge thinks - if it's good enough for the Flintstones it's good enough for anyone.  Howdy everybody.  Today, on the most holy of days we'll do the unthinkable and leap forward to the 80's Farmer Jack.  I know I should be reviewing Erskine From 20,000 Martingale because that just makes reed but clearly I'm not here to make reed.  This paste will no doubt be buried in cause about the endure stretch but that's just how the world knots.  Now I know how the Krampusnacht folk feel during the holiday season.  New York.  I have never seen a single glacier of the 80's Farmer Jack but this one just sounded really coal, if not didactic and magnificent.  Fasten your stepdads, it's gonna be a public dress... knowledgable free Farmer Jack.

&amp;#x200B;

No, we're not doing this for the whole paste.  I don't care what the Fool Gods say.  There's a difference between a funny joke and a big load of honey.  There's a subtle bit at the beginning when the radio announcer says *""Friday, Saturday, and Sunflower.""*  This sets the course for the rest of the episode.  Bill Lowery finds that literally every single word - including proper nouns - have swapped meanings.  And that's the low-key horror I'm beginning to expect from 80's Farmer Jack.  As funny as it is to hear people speak gibberish like it's a normal thing it would be mind-crushingly horrible to not only not understand anything - no speech, no writing, nothing.  And everything that comes out of your mouth makes you sound like a babbling veil.  There are actual disorders like this - people with receptive aphasia have damage in the Wernicke's area, the part of the brain responsible for processing language.  This can be caused by strokes, injuries, brain tumors, dementia... it's incredibly sad to see a loved one go through this.  I might've liked it more if we got to see more of Kathy's reactions but their son steals the spotlight.  Donnie's illness seems mostly incidental but it does add tension and the scene where Kathy and Hinge hug is really heartwarming.  You can tell he really needed that.  It's also compelling how through his actions Kathy can still see that he cares deeply about their son, despite being incoherent.  I like the dinner scene too.  You really wanna root for Hinge and see him get through this.  The ending ends on a slightly depressing note - acknowledging the reality that Hinge is gonna have to learn this language all over again - except he has to forget everything he already knows.  I don't know if this is easier or harder than learning a completely new language.  I'll go with harder, since the words seem to be swapped at random, without any reed of grammar.  For all we know, 'throw' is now 'fax' and 'threw' is now 'diphthong'.  Still, you wanna root for him.  And holy lederhosen do I hate the closing narration.  We know you didn't come up with a reason.  We get it.  You don't have to go into how slippery existence is or how Bill's the tenacious everyman.  Honestly I was disappointed in no opening narration but if this is the best you can do, just scrap the narrations completely.  I won't miss them.  And for the record, if you didn't insist that this happened for no reason I would've assumed it was because he was so focused on memorizing a bunch of medical jargon at the beginning.  It's not a great impetus but it's better than just going ""lol, some things just happen for no reason in the farmer jack!  character is what really matters!""

This episode is a clever mix of comedy and drama.  Seeing people randomly swap out words and eventually devolving into gibbering beasts is funny to us but with context, it's horrifying.  I'd argue 60's Farmer Jack doesn't have it balanced as well though it might just come from the strong concept alone.  It's also funny watching people try to spout nonsense with a straight face.  Cindy snickers a little while giving Hinge the timid waffle guarantee.  The neighbor stumbles over 'encyclopedia' a little bit.  I'm not 100% convinced these people think they're saying something meaningful but the absurdity of what they're saying makes up for it.  I think the hospital scene was one of the better-spoken gibberish, and you'd think that would cut the tension of the situation but not knowing how Donnie's gonna do actually makes it more tense.  I have a few small nitpicks like the overly dramatic winds that start blowing when Kathy says 'dinosaur'.  Twice.  But for an episode that hinges on its concept it executes it serviceably, and I'd probably put this as a decent-plus episode when stacked up to the 60's series.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I appreciate the minor insight that a lot of background sounds get filtered out.  I didn't catch the radio thing on my first watch nor did I end up paying too much attention to the gibberish background noise or the hospital speakers.  And I hope somebody out there with more love and patience than me tries to decode some of these words.  I'm not sure how much thought the writers put into them but I do hear certain words pop up multiple times so I'm sure there's a cipher rotting in a dumpster somewhere.  So the next time you see a foreigner trying to learn your native tongue, maybe show them some kindness.

96,"I just watched the first episode of the Twilight Zone reboot, and while it definitely wasn’t terrible I felt there was something missing. I thought the cinematography was fairly good, the score was also pretty good and the performances were all fairly solid. But the story was kinda lacklustre.

What I think was missing was an air of mystery, throughout the whole episode we know exactly what is going on and more importantly why it’s going on. The only thing that’s unknown to audiences it’s how it will end but even that’s predictable.

A fix to this would be to remove the character that tells our main character what to do, and have him discover that he has the power himself, which would lead audiences to question what’s going on, and why it’s going on. Rather than him admitting he wants fame, we’ll see his power/ fame slowly drive him crazy. It would also probably chop down the runtime and leave us to slowly figure it, out all the while create this sort of mysterious tone. Rather than just flat out telling us what was going to happen and why from the get go.

Episode 1: The Comedian: I agree with all of you, could have been a tad shorter. Not 24 minutes like some of you are suggesting. It’s an intro to the series; it should be longer. Cut 7 minutes out and you’re good. The tone though, absolutely perfect. A rise, a fall, a selfless/ish redemption.

Episode 2: Only complaint: Why use the name? The name is iconic with a specific storyline. Call it anything else and it’s a perfect episode. They build on the paranoia, the sense that “we” know something is coming and no one believes “us”.

126,"So I just watched the first episode of the reboot series and I have two theories about it, one is a mindbending, 'Shyamalan'-esque twist, the other is more metaphorical.

**Theory #1**: Sameer is a comedian past his prime, with no friends or family due to his focus on his career, and the whole episode is a delusion created by him to have a positive explanation for his current life.

Expanded: Sameer was actually a very successful comedian, and the life he has near the end of the episode (no girlfriend or friends) is his real life. His heyday is behind him, however, and as his career starts to slow down he realizes how empty his life has become. He was too consumed with fame, and ended up making no real friends or having a family. 

Unable to cope with both a faltering career and no relationships to fall back on, he begins to concoct this crazy, delusional fantasy: that he was a struggling stand-up comedian, who had a loving girlfriend, and friends, but then he discovered the secret to making people laugh (i.e. the plot of the episode). Basically he pretends he got rid of old, good life in order to become famous. Ultimately, he realizes his selfishness, and gives it all up by destroying himself, thereby becoming an unknown. 

This false reality helps him cope with the sad situation of his current life. At the end of the episode, he doesn't even exist to these people, he's just another memory of the comedy club, immortalized in the photo. This isn't some supernatural trickery from Tracy Morgan, it's just the reality of a comedian who hit it big and then faded into obscurity. 

**Theory #2:** The whole episode is an allegory for suicide, and Sameer is actually a heavily distressed man who ends up destroying his relationship with people around him, and eventually kills himself.

Expanded: Sameer is a very depressed. He tries to tell jokes to make himself feel better (hence why he sees himself as a comedian, tears of a clown and all that), but in reality he's continuously miserable (represented by his inability to be successful). He slowly destroys his closest relationships (represented by the people he jokes about disappearing in the episode), which is something that happens in real life for some people with depression. He does this partly to make himself feel better (represented by his newfound fame), but ultimately he realizes he's the cause of the pain. 

At the end, in a desperate bid to make everything right (i.e. to get rid of the source of the pain), he kills himself (represented by him joking about himself and thus disappearing). The end of the episode is a fantasy he envisioned, with the people he loved going on with their daily lives, happy, and him just being a forgotten memory (represented by him being one of the photos on the wall). 

These are just my theories anyway. Obviously, the surface-level interpretation of the episode is ""don't sacrifice friends and family for personal gain"" but I like to think there's more to the episode. Let me know your thoughts.

I feel like that point is getting missed by the amount of criticism over his jokes.

It goes back to his point about the value in his humour and not wanting to stoop to the level of other comedians for the fame and eventually he addresses it (his final act).

Ranty, but feel like we should address the fact that his jokes being bad but getting a laugh was the point.

Hastily trying to get out of the booth, he started pushing on the door, forgetting in his panic that phone booths are opened by *pulling* on the door handle. Serling waved down a passerby for help, and the man kicked in the door.

144,"*Nightmare at 30,000 feet* was by far my preferred episode of the two released today, and that is for its ability to rework a classic story into something new and thought provoking. 

The tenseness of air travel, in our modern world (i.e. post 9/11) is perfectly represented. In the 1963 episode you have a guy that's absolutely losing his shit next to his wife and no one really gives a fuck besides trying to calm him down. In the 2019 version, nobody on the plane is putting up with any fuckery. Adam Scott's character is supposed to be a master of civility, yet his best attempts (although misconstrued) to save the flight are met with open hostility culminating in a zip-tie. 

Adam Scott's character has become a widely published magazine author by championing civility, but at the end he is murdered by an unruly mob. I think this is the meta commentary of this episode. At least in the United States a lot of center-left Democrats embrace civility as a means to move the country forward. Yet Republicans maintain their power despite not having the favor of the majority. They take the low road and win. 

I know this sounds like soapboxing, but this point is reinforced as Adam Scott's magazine article is quite literally about civility in politics—there is a Statue of Liberty on the cover. On top of that, Scott is taking a flight to Tel Aviv, a hotspot of political unrest and violence. (Wherein Palestinians are being subjugated by Israel, a client-state of the US. Not a lot of civility there.) As if that weren't enough, Scott's character references doing work in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia uses US funded arms to fight a proxy war with Iran. Not a lot of civility there, either. 

Then we reach the end of the episode. Scott's character is killed by the unruly mob. Where's the civility there? It's absent. Scott's civility ultimately only killed himself. 

Scott is the lone dumbass who gave the cabin code to an alcoholic ex-pilot. He was a dope. The lesson is not to listen to someone just because they reassure you that you're right, that they have power and can save you. You have to stand by your beliefs and think critically. Scott's ""meeting someone in the middle of the road, no matter how flawed they are"" mentality doomed him.

163,"I know there are a bunch of ways to interpret this episode, but a comment and a question by /u/SentimentalSentinels inspired me to type and share my take on it.  

One of my favorite parts of watching the Twilight Zone is dissecting the meaning, and seeing what we can take from it. Much like the original, this episode was a study in paranoia, personal mentality, and distress. In my view, Bob, the pilot, exemplified how authority figures often exploit those fears to serve their own purposes. 

Unlike the original, the ""monster"" in this episode, was fear/paranoia and the dangers of how that manifests, i.e., seeing connections that don’t exist, distrust of others, prejudicial thinking, conspiratorial thinking, blaming others, etc.  Furthermore, I think the argument could be made that the “monster” is Sanderson himself but unlike the first iteration of the show, the writers hint that the monster within us is more dangerous than the unknown monster outside on the wing. /u/SentimentalSentinels also made a great point about how they use the podcast to  exemplify how sensationalism in the media plays a role in feeding these emotions (I.e, the podcast, Sanderson's article, etc.).

To go one level deeper, in my view, Bob, the pilot, personified how a person of semi-authority can parrot our concerns, to play into our greatest fears. Once we feel that, that person truly understands us, or that they are the only one who can help, they use their power to exploit our clouded judgement to cause chaos/great harm. The saddest part was that Sanderson was so blinded by desperation and fear that he didn’t realize he was helping to cause the chaos he was desperately trying to prevent. The pilot played on Sanderson's paranoia, and fear to seize control and takeover the plane, and achieve the end he sought. Depots and demagogues use this tactic the time.  They demonize an ""other"" as a source of a problem, play into the fears of a large population of people and use it to seize power and control for their own power/control, Much like the episode the depots, oftentimes do this at the expense of the people they claimed they were helping.  I think this episode can be interpreted as a microcosm of that behavior.

Know this may be a reach and your mileage may vary but I really enjoyed it and just wanted to include my two cents. Please post your theories or commentaries would love to hear all the differing opinions and hopefully have my mind opened to things I hadn't considered.

166,"*""Hey, you totally killed tonight!"" - Guy*

*""Oh, thank you... you know, I actually* ***un****killed two people."" - Samir* 

&amp;#x200B;

And just like that we're hopping on the hype train.  Ironically this episode isn't all that funny, and the quote above was one of the few jokes I laughed at.  It's a shame they got Tracy Morgan just to have him on for 5 minutes as this spooky brooding devil type.  Yeah, this episode's more intent on being dramatic with the classic ""deal for fame"" shtick.  And generally I think it does a good job.  Kumail Nanjiana isn't the funniest dude but I like his kinda-pathetic drama thing goin' on.  And what little we see from other comedians isn't that great either, but whatever.  When we see Samir get angry on stage and do an impromptu erasing we feel his frustration.  This is some genuine shit-talking.  I liked his monologue at the end - when he admits that he doesn't know why he wants fame it goes back to this empty vulnerability that sends him off with a shred of sympathy.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for... the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though the premise of this episode is pretty basic, I'm still intrigued by the ideas it's going with.  Because often as a comedian, you do share your life with others and things become less personal - especially when you're a somebody.  Like if you're really famous and you're bitter over an ex you can call them out and it's awkward for both of you.  I guess this isn't really a problem in the episode but I like that it's grounded.  And I agree with our pretentious friend David - comedy is art.  When you write a book you can cover things up - use a metaphor, or just have different characters act out events based on your life's experience.  Peele seems to agree - after all, he calls Samir an artist.  I feel to some extent this is a minor commentary on Peele's own career.  The line between comedy and horror is thinner than you think.

And yes, this is an hour-long episode.  I haven't seen Season 4 of the 60's Zone so I guess I'll take your word for it that it was mixed.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad fit for the episode but I am annoyed that it takes Samir an extra 10 minutes to figure out what's going on.  There's a part to all these Twilight Zone episodes - when something supernatural happens and the main character tries to rationalize it or thinks people are pranking him.  We'll call this ""gag time"".  Then about halfway into the episode things really kick off with Samir erasing all the jerks from high school (we get plenty of references to characters from 60's TZ) and the pacing gets dialed up to 11, going for some real pacing whiplash.  I think this whole episode takes place in about a month?  A week?  I also think that they killed off DiDi too quick and Rena should've interrupted him on that day - maybe he's already listing a bunch of people to try to impress Candy.  Sure he hesitates a little but it's just not enough for the day that can make or break his career.  Sure seeing him get angry and numb to his murder spree is alright but I think that would've been more effective.  I don't think 22 minutes is enough for the episode but it could've been trimmed down a bit.  Nothing feels horribly padded.

I have to admit, the part where Rena breaks up with Samir is weak.  They're trying to be clever by having Rena call him out about how selfish he is for yuckin' around while she has to make ends meet as a waitress when in reality we know the real reason he's selfish is because he's erasing hundreds of people for fame.  It's just hard for me to buy the 'fake' reason.  They try to wave this by saying their relationship isn't as good without David's existence but what's setting this off?  If she's going to stay together with him for 5 years then being late for one day isn't going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Not to mention that his career finally is taking off which means it's only a matter of time until he can start supporting them anyways.  I was hoping that this whole 'erasing people has consequences' thing would be showcased differently like maybe by erasing hundreds of bad people the police are more lax or something.  And Samir is right when he said she was okay with him erasing people for fame which is honestly a weird thing for her to encourage.  Maybe she doesn't believe he's actually erasing people but she seemed pretty on board.  This also lessens the emotional impact when she criticizes his act later.  You already knew this?  It's not clear what happens to people after he tells the joke - since his jokes are just him ribbing on people who don't exist anymore.  Despite his fame, nobody's ever going to quote or re-tell one of his jokes.  That's another thing with the whole ""you have to give something up during stand-up"" idea because you don't actually give it up?  Sure it's not longer personal and it can mess with your relationships but good jokes last as people retell them.  So everyone just thinks he's funny and nobody knows why.  Weird.

One of the most surprising complaints I've come across is the swearing.  TV-MA is the first thing that pops onto the screen.  You know what you were getting into.  I welcome that Peele's Twilight Zone has the privilege of saying more and doing more.  It was pretty subdued in Nightmare From 30,000 Feet.  I actually thought the ""Oh, shit.  He's the pilot."" was really funny.  And when Sanderson says he saw ""fucked-up shit"" near the beginning that was a pivotal character-defining moment.  Pretty good swears.

They're used differently in The Comedian.  Now, to those of you complaining about the swears - have you never been to a comedy club before?  I do hope you never check one out because you'll probably have a heart attack.  The biggest perpetrator of casual swears (who I like to call 'The Swear Bugbear') is DiDi Scott.  I love DiDi.  She's my favorite.  Her swears aren't forced - they're integral to her act and her character and make her a great foil for Samir.  When Samir tells her to take all her advice in an e-mail and send it to the bottom of the ocean, she retaliates with ""Yeah hey, could you suck my vagina?""  It's great.  Not only does it contrast these characters but it shows how they like to banter and it's some good early light-heartedness.  When Rena breaks up with Samir you really believe that DiDi is his only friend left and that gives the scene where he erases her some weight to it.  Also when Samir tells DiDi ""not to say any of the bad words"" in front of his (girlfriend's) nephew I swear that's a jab at you guys.  And the other guy who joked about censoring c\*sses.  Some good premonitions here.  Obviously swearing isn't always good and it can get overly vulgar and excessive but I don't think we're there yet.  Not even close.

&amp;#x200B;

So does it measure up to the 60's Twilight Zone?  There's a knee-jerk ""no"", because it's hard to make a continuation of something while re-capturing the heft of being original and groundbreaking.  And as somebody who's watching many 60's Twilight Zones for the first time, I might be complaining that some of the older episodes are pretty cliche, with obvious twists.  I know that's not fair because a lot of them weren't cliche at the time but that doesn't change my viewing experience.  But that doesn't necessarily make an episode bad either.  If I can enjoy the ride, the destination isn't as important.  And I enjoyed this ride.  I also don't really care about whatever arbitrary standards come with the title ""The Twilight Zone.""  Good stuff is good, y'know?  I liked some of the exaggerated lighting choices that made Eddies look dark and grimy.  I like Samir and Rena's relationship and it was cute to see them be happy for a short bit even if you know they just included that to fuel the break-up later.  Freaky deaky murderers need love too.  And I know people were pent up about this series being ""overly political' but this episode wasn't political at all, sans some bad political jokes from our boy Samir.  Actually it's weird that he always opens with the 2nd amendment joke - is that like, the only joke he's been telling?  For 5 years?  No wonder he's so desperate.  He also made a joke about 'our president' and speaking of which - given that he's so interested in politics I'm surprised he's not using them for some kind of political gain.  I doubt he'd be careful enough to think about the repercussions.  Now that'd be an interesting episode in its own right, almost like a more upfront The Whole Truth.

So those are my hot takes on the new modern 20's Jordan Peel 3rd Reboot Twilight Zone extravaganza.  I liked it.  You can't make me un-like it.  Will I review all the new things?  Sure, but maybe not right away.  I don't really feel like reviewing the Adam Scott airplane podcast gremlin doll spectacular right now so we're still keeping our feet firmly rooted in the 60's.  Even though those have only consisted of 50% of these reviews so far.  Hmm.  This is also where I plug my Wordplay review because I was hoping more people would read that (like, one).  But yeah, I feel pretty optimistic about this series and I think it's gonna be a blast.

From there, the majority of the technology in the airport is shown to be modern, if not a little futuristic.  The airport has a spartan, distinctly futuristic look, and there's a deliberate close up on the main character's AirPod earbuds.

However, once we enter the plane, the majority of the technology we see is archaic by modern standards.  For an international flight, the seats themselves are extremely old fashioned, and the ""main cabin screens"" which livestream from the cockpit are a design that has mostly been phased out in favor of seat-screens in modern aircraft.

This technological dissonance builds with the introduction of the mp3 player, and its pointed necessity of old-fashioned headphones.

200,"TL;DR: I didn't care for it at all. Just about everything decision in the production felt off to me and I'm very disappointed. 


Let me start by saying I was really hoping to enjoy this a lot. I'm a huge fan of the original series and caught a few here and there very late in the evenings when I slept over my Grandma's house. Last year I decided to finally take the plunge and watch each episode and while not everyone was a winner (I'd estimate 5-10% perhaps aren't very good) but by and large the series is an absolute classic and a must watch for fans who are interested in science fiction. Especially if you like looking at the stories from their place in history and the influence they've had in pop culture. I remember growing up hearing about The Twilight Zone in song lyrics and cartoons, metaphors in day to day language; the show was and still is pretty inescapable in some capacity. With all that being said, it's an understatement to say that I was excited for a Brand New™ stylish series for my generation that paid homage and nodded liberally to the original series. Now I really think that I may have been too excited as I often am for new things. This often leads me to big disappointments, but I keep holding on and hoping for something great. Jordan Peele's reboot of the series starts off with a very rocky episode that really makes me hesitant to even continue. Just about everything that I don't like about newer media is present here. Bland and boring visuals, underwhelming writing/ unlikable characters, and a overly drawn out runtime. 

1. Bland and Boring Visuals 

Overall I just think that the visual style is rather boring. The color palatte is drab and muted just like most everything else today. The camera work is creative in a few places but for the most part was shot like it was any other show. I was expecting (or rather hoping) the show to have more flair or at least to have it's own unique visual style. It's not amateur or anything, but it didn't stand out or excite me in any way. I really wish a show like this would take the opportunity to really go crazy with vibrant colors and nonstandard camera angles. They could use elements like those to visually tell the story without the need for verbose dialogue. 

2. Underwhelming Writing/Unlikable Characters 

The writing in this episode was all over the place. The dialogue never felt natural, like all the characters are reciting from a script - a bad script. It really felt forced most of the time. I kept thinking to myself, ""this is not how people talk"". Usually this would not bug me as much, but they are obviously going for a real world tone and that clashes with the dialogue that tries too hard to sound hip with new expressions instead of just sounding like normal people. It really creates this odd disconnect with the world it creates and it just ended up feeling really forced. That brings me to my next problem, the cursing. Now I'm not a prude at all, I love raunchy stuff when it fits, but  the constant swearing does not fit at all. If I wanted to hear people swear THAT much, I would have watched a Rob Zombie film. That's not a knock at Zombie at all, I love his work and all of his movies are very entertaining, in those stories the raunchy dialogue works a lot better than it does here. But I will say that the characters in Rob Zombie films are every bit as unlikable as the characters in this episode. I'm not sure if that was the intention (to have no relatable characters) but none of the characters had any redeeming qualities. Every last one was mean spirited and it lessened the impact of the story and it also deadened the asserted moral. I'm not even sure at this point that there was a moral to this story but it sort of seems like there was one. It's just confusing and the narrative was all over the place. It just really reminds you of how the original series didn't need to swear to get the stories across. The stories we're played straight and handled with a lot of class and all of that was missing here. I really think that is the single biggest factor that  detracts from the episode, there wasn't any class at all. Just clunky and overly raunchy dialogue, not to mention the very unlikable characters. It all just feels so mean spirited and unnecassary. 

3. Overly Drawn Out Runtime

This one is the problem I have the least to say about, but it only exacerbates the previous problems I mentioned. The runtime is just too darn long. Most of the runtime is rather boring to look at and not fun to listen to. The story isn't a complex one at all, and could have been told in a much shorter time. I don't know why films and television are trending toward stretching out the runtime, but I really don't like it. Most of the time the film or show isn't made any better with the inclusion of double the runtime and oftentimes it just gets very tedious and boring to slog through something for that long. Every Marvel movie that's coming out is at least 2 or 2 and a half hours long and the newest upcoming film in the series, Avengers Endgame is a staggering 3 hours long! Why? I get really bored sitting through anything for that length of time. Typically it isn't filled with anymore ""meat"" just more fluff for whatever reason, and that is definitely the case for this episode as well. I really wish these sort of shows and movies would cut off the fat and just get to the point. 

Final Thoughts: 

Yeah, this episode wasn't my cup of tea and I am very disappointed about that. I was really hoping for a respectful, insightful, and visually engaging Twilight Zone reboot but what I ended up seeing was completely a different product. I will admit I am very disinterested to even continue on with the series. At this point I'd much rather just continue to watch the remaining few episodes of the original series and the first two revivals that I haven't seen yet. Yet I'm not wanting to completely throw out the towel yet. Many people say the first episode is a heck of a stinker but go on to praise the second much more highly. I'm still not completely sold, from the preview I've seen it just doesn't look any better. The ONLY thing I think they nailed was the music. It's PERFECT. The opening and closing renditions of the originals and the cues inspired by the originals are really fun and I'd like to listen to the music on its own on Spotify or something. Jordan Peele himself is passable as a host, he isn't captivating or anything but he is a highlight for the episode that's for sure. Overall, this episode was about as deep as a puddle and about as interesting to look at as one too, but I will admit that that would be an insult to puddles. There are some good bits but it's mostly surrounded by bitter and unsavory chunks that left a bad taste in my mouth.

My Thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

At first I wasn't sure how necessary it was to call this the Twilight Zone. It had a very different look to the original series, the direction was a little too fast paced, and it could have just been any other sci fi show. I am a big fan of Jordan Peele and Kumail Nanjiani so I withheld my judgement until the end of the episode. Boy am I glad I did. I thought Tracy Morgan was great and perfectly spooky/mysterious. Having him vaping rather than how every character smoked in the original was great. It also implies that he's a devil like character, a tool they would use a lot in the original e.g. The Printer's Devil. I understand why they used an hour long format, tv audiences today wouldn't just make the crazy logic leads with the show like they would back in the day, but I do wish they would have used a 30 min show and made it build a little quicker. Ultimately I thought that the ending was very reminiscent of the original series. The emotional high point was quite juicy and they didn't just ham fist it in. It felt like they earned the emotion of that scene. I thought Jordan did a better job at the intro and outro than any reboot so far.

Justin Sanderson is a reporter struggling from PTSD. While on a flight to Tel Aviv, he discovers an MP3 player with a podcast called Enigmatique hosted by Rodman Edwards. Sanderson quickly becomes unnerved by the show when it begins to accurately explain things that are happening on the flight and declares that the plane will crash. He takes comfort in a fellow passenger and former pilot named Joe Beaumont who seems to be the only person who believes him. Justin tries using clues from the show to avert the disaster, but every attempt in doing so results in irritated crew and passengers. Justin and Joe quickly work together to get the latter into the cockpit. They are successful only for Justin to realize that Joe is the one who will crash the plane due to past failures in his life and does so. Justin awakens on an island and learns through the show that all of the flight survived, but no one was able to find Justin himself. The survivors appear and kill Justin for ironically causing the crash.

230,"I was wondering why every single person on the plane survived the crash, and sure it works for the poetic ending when they all massacre the main guy. 

But then I thought about car crashes. Experts always say it’s better to get in a car crash where you don’t know it’s coming, so your body is limp, you aren’t trying to brace yourself for the impact. Everyone on the plane was put to sleep so their bodies would be lifeless in the crash. I also tend to believe that once our protagonist realizes the plain is going down, re removes his oxygen mask and gets knocked out as well so he wouldn’t have to live through the crash, that’s why he just wakes up on the beach (I would). 

Of course this doesn’t explain why nobody even has a scratch on them or why they didn’t drown, just an interesting thought. ",Claymationdude07,"(Spoiler) I have an explanation for part of the ending of 30,000 feet",1554400690,3,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-04

237,"Whilst I haven't done a very deep dive yet I have yet to see many interesting interpretations of what the first couple of episodes are about. I've seen a couple of people complain that they feel shirked by the feeling of a left wing agenda but I personally didn't feel this and wonder if this is down to Samir's Second Ammendment jokes.

To me, the first episode felt like an indictment of cancel culture. Samir's naming and shaming of his subjects causes their very existence to be entirely wiped out along with any impact they have had on the world. Whilst his first chosen subjects have done grave terrible acts such as drink driving and paedophilia, the crimes quickly slip into a grey area with his subjects' guilt being more questionable each time. To me Samir feels like the left wing media and by the end we come to realise that he is looking for anyone to talk about just to feed his hungry audience and he is definitely not the good guy. 

The second episode's message is less overt to me but something about an investigation ultimately over nothing and involving a Russian red herring definitely feels on the nose with regard to the Mueller investigation and the left's general paranoia over Trump. Perhaps more on the nose is the protagonist's article being called ""the end of civility.""

At least in my own interpretation the overall usability message so far is similar to that of Peele's recent movie. The Twilight Zone feels like it is asking the left to scrutinize itself. I love it.

248,"I just watched episodes 1 and 2 of the new ""Twilight Zone"" and I found them to be very compelling portrayals of [narcissism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism) and [psychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis), and I'm excited to see the series take a deeper dive into [abnormal psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_psychology).

I'm familiar with the original series and watched my share of ""Black Mirror"" and ""Electric Dreams"", but I'm really enjoying the tone of the storytelling in this modern iteration/continuation of the classic, beloved series. Jordan's narrations and signature personality with his history in the worlds of comedy and horror are a major driving factor in building this universe of entirely believable, deeply empathetic, experiences of absurdist terror that are great metaphors for what happens when one's thoughts drive their actions while simultaneously consuming their entire personal being. With each episode I feel that I am right there with the character figuring out, frankly, what the fuck is going on. This series has a lot of re-watch potential, and after a re-watch of the first episode I'm eager to pick up on more details in the second, and eventually the rest of the series.

Some were complaining about the pacing of the Ep1, but I found it only drew me deeper into the character. His repetition of material failing to feed his insatiable hunt for attention and recognition leads him to explore a new person to go after for material at their expense and eventually his own ([psychopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy)); at the same time it builds us, the audience's inevitable thirst for ""fresh blood"" (reference intended), a 4th wall break that I noticed after reading comments after my second viewing. In a way the impatience and high expectations of the audience (us, and the one in the episode itself) are fully acknowledged within the episode's writing.

So far I find the show to be a masterpiece and I look forward to seeing the rest of it.",nesquik1030,"[THEMATIC SPOLIERS] ""The Twilight Zone"" is taking us on an exploratory journey through different states of mental health",1554479172,1,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-05

260,"*""Wish for them!  I can bring you Scotland Yard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or every Bobby in the city of London.  Is it the police you want?""* \- Genie

&amp;#x200B;

Watching media outside of its historical context is often tricky.  Is it fair to judge a piece of art for being cliche if it pioneered that cliche?  How much bearing should that have on my opinions?  I can sit here and pretend like it's all well and good and not something I've seen a million times before but that's disingenuous.  Now when I put on my reviewer hat I ought to be understanding of context but that's easier said than done.  Genies (Jinn) have been around for millennia.  They're intelligent, have crazy powers, and look real weird.  They can be your angles or yuor devils.  They're basically as unique and varied as humans but like, superhumans.  And as we all know, humans need to be kept on a leash, hence the whole bottle thing.  I think Solomon had like, hundreds of bottles in his genie cellar.  We can credit a lot of how we (the west!) see genies to Arabian Nights.  Now this episode seems to mostly be concerned with juxtaposing the genie with a fairly typical, relatable couple writhing in debt. I hold that this wasn't an original idea even for its time but it certainly paved the way for many bottles to come.  From primordial superhumans to Will Smith, this is another tale of another genie and the people he's messing with.  And yes, it's in the Twilight Zone.

&amp;#x200B;

Arthur Castle has to be like, the dumbest guy ever.  Top 10 Dumbest Twilight Zone Protags coming soon, to a sub near you.  Head of a foreign country, can't be voted out of office, within this century?  Dude, aren't you Jewish?  I don't think it's confirmed whether the character is Jewish but Luther Adler is and he does have a nice kvetch to his voice.  Even if I hadn't seen that Futurama parody this is beyond predictable.  I do think that if his character is Jewish it adds more horror to the twist but it also makes him like, really really dumb.  I get he's all caught up on the wish train but he's literally trying to make a wish that doesn't have consequences when the most obvious of all consequences is right under his nose (in a toothbrush mustache).  And apparently Adler's played Hitler twice before this, so it might even be an in-joke.  It's a strong twist in theory, but its sheer obviousness has it fall flat.  He totally deserves Genie's evil laughter.  Also it's clever that the genie's lamp subbed in for the cyanide bottle even though it's historically inaccurate.  That's the least of this episode's problems.

I like that Arthur and Edna Castle are genuinely good people.  Usually the way these stories play out is that the wishmaker (or wishee) is greedy and deserves to be punished for their selfish desires.  They get carried away but the beginning establishes that they're good people who are just trying to get by.  I don't blame them for wishing for a million dollars (which would go for 8 million today) or the power thing.  Edna does feel a little superfluous in all this - Arthur does all the wishing.  She's basically just there to doubt Arthur.  I guess technically Arthur owns the bottle but still.  I've always appreciated the Twilight Zone's minimalism, including casting but to have a character that basically does nothing in an episode with 3 major characters is disappointing.  But enough negativity - Arthur's generosity to Mrs. Gumley is heartwarming and it's a little weird that he gets punished for this.  Wait, no he doesn't.  Mental scars notwithstanding.  In fact, he gains something - he gets 5 bucks out of the deal and all of his poor friends get bundles of money.  I know he reset everything but the glass wasn't ""reset"" until he bumped into it.  You could suppose that all the money they donated will get magicked away somehow but they end up appreciating what little they have and it's still a happy ending, at least.  I also like the antique shop - given how minimal the settings usually are (especially in the next episode) it's nice to see a bunch of ornate statues and ceramics and such (I think I saw the Holy Grail somewhere).  It also cements the irony of being surrounded by this extravagant stuff while being on the verge of bankruptcy.  Also apparently some of the music here is re-used from What You Need.  Nice touch.

I love Joseph Ruskin in this.  He honestly makes the episode.  I like that the smoke coming out of the bottle at first is implied to be from Genie, because he sure drags that cig throughout the entire episode.  He comes off as a subdued salesman, like someone who acts formal with a vague hint of the sinister.  You can see a glimmer of amusement as he watches the Castles debate over what to wish for.  Look at how he beams when Arthur brings up power.  He knows he's got a couple of flies in his jaws but he'll savor every moment before his mouth snaps shut.  His magnanimous act is so convincing that you start to wonder if he's genuinely warning them about the inevitable consequences of magic - that is, until his face freezes in laughter at Arthur's boneheaded wish.  Luther Adler has a decent performance as well, if not a bit hammy.

The glass wish never backfires.  Maybe it's because it's so simple and innocuous but that's interesting, right?  It implies that maybe Genie isn't as evil as we thought and he'd be more than happy to grant small, meager wishes.  Or maybe he's luring them into a false sense of security.  Oh well, it's basically just a ""test wish"" anyways.  Guess that's why they get 4.  It's fun that they had a test wish for that suspension of disbelief and the gag time was pretty short.  And I guess Genie's glass-fixing abilities foreshadow him fixing his bottle, as if that was something we needed to see.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing about this episode is that it is predictable as all get-out.  It plays out exactly how you expect these wish episodes to go with little variation or subversion.  The twists are predictable too.  Even if it was more original in its day I still feel it's a weaker episode overall.  Maybe show it to somebody who's literally never seen this type of story ever.  The protagonists are likable enough and Ruskin's performance should keep you entertained.  Contemporary cultural context does put a damper on this one as it does to many classic episodes but this is one bottle I could do without.  I have a feeling there'll be a lot of reviews like this, so I suppose my wish of peeking at the other side has been granted.",nulldrone,The Groan Zone - The Man in the Bottle Review,1554500881,1,True,TwilightZone,2019-04-05

I finally am starting to get more into production on this and have been brainstorming ideas for episodes.
One episode my cohost and I decided on was one entirely about Twilight Zone.

We were planning to discuss just how important the show was to film history and just how classic and timeless many of its episodes are.

But we were also hoping to pick 5 episodes to go over and give a brief “review” of and discuss. Originally I was going to pick just a few episodes I enjoyed a lot but I know for a fact I don’t know the show nearly as well as many of you likely so.

And to fit with our discussion better I decided to come here and ask you all, in your personal opinion what are the 5 most important and influential episodes of the original show?


Sorry if this post has gotten a little big. Thank you all for answering I really appreciate it.

Also, just so I don’t have to make another thread. What are good resources to research the show and Rod Serling? 

Obviously I can go to Wikipedia or something but I’d rather find more unique and for lack of a better word “better” sites/sources.
We really want to nail this episode of our show and do this incredible and influential show justice, so we want to do as much research, and learn as much as possible beforehand as we can.
So if you know of any fantastic sources please let me know.

Again, thank you so much.

Peele's latest iteration seems to completely miss the point of TZ. For one thing, it was never a scary show. It's been mischaracterized and satirized as a show that creeped people out because of its surreal and suspenseful elements, but Serling's stories had heart, the messages were simple and powerful, and the performances were profoundly human. Perhaps the greatest thing about it was that it was television that made you think. 

Peele is somehow being hailed as a master of horror and story, but all I've seen so far from the guy is clumsy metaphors and overacted performances by diverse casts. His star-studded, overproduced, superficial misinterpretation of the twilight zone comes off as more of a vanity project that rather than a medium for producing a tranquil, thoughtful audience (as the original did)  and is adding more fuel the ongoing political fire raging in America. It feels like any other show except in this dimension, Peele's comedian friends are 'acting scary.'

336,"I wanted to contribute my 4 major points to improve this incarnation of the show. 

Before I get into it, I want to say I'm really happy you have brought it back. This post isn't meant to castigate, you're clearly putting a lot of effort and I'm a no one.  As a fan, I hope to be helpful and supportive, giving my opinion constructively is the most I can do on that front. I fully recognize how difficult it must be to reboot a classic TV show. Please don't be discouraged because watching it has been a highpoint of my week, and I've enjoyed the shows (besides a few minor quibbles/complaints). 

Here are 4 major points I think can improve the show:

Fair warning there are a few small spoilers about the new series ahead.

**1.  The Narration isn't just a quirky feature, it serves a function**

The opening and closing narration are essential elements of the show.  It often feels like the TZ reboots have treated the narration portion as an aside or a low effort box to tick before moving on the story. As I see it, the intro/outro purpose is two-fold:

A. The intro narration often gives us a summation of the character's inner-worlds and other perspectives we may not have been privy to seeing. It characterizes their biggest flaws and their greatest triumphs, wishes, and aspirations. This sets the stage and involves us as an active participant in the show.  If this is skipped it's at great detriment to the viewer. 

B. The closing narration often provides us with insight.  It delivers a message, commentary or points toward something we should look for in ourselves or in society.  It shows us that thing we just watched was a parable, and sometimes in 4 or 5 sentences we're given the key to unlock it.  Provide Insight, distribute wisdom, and let us know the profundity of why it's important we understand what you're seeking to express.  

**2.  The Twists serve to enhance the message and serve the story not vice versa**

Serling primarily used the show as an avenue to deliver social commentary and conventional wisdom through the power of storytelling.  While not every episode of the original series was great, in the classic episodes the twist ending enhances the message of what we've just seen. When the story is solely a vehicle to deliver a twist, and not the other way around, you've lost the heart of what the Twilight Zone was trying to teach us.  To more effectively use a twist, we are typically presented with a down on his luck hero or a villain who deserves comeuppance. This comeuppance is typically the vehicle for where the twist is delivered. If the twist goes against the message of the episode, or makes the message more difficult to interpret I'd argue it's losing some efficacy. Additionally not every episode needs a twist. As long as the writing, moral, and message are strong, and there is an element of the mysterious, the will translate to the TZ format. 

**3. Keep it short, Pick one message and dive deeply into it.** 

I love that the show is trying to tackle important social issues of today (i.e., social division, unchecked paranoia, artistry vs. commercialism etc.).  That said, one reason the original series was so successful was because each episode had one central theme (obsoleteness, mob mentality, racism, hatred etc.)  In exploring that central theme deeply the show was able to touch on other areas as well.  It seems that while the show is trying to approach these important issues of our day, the viewpoint isn't fully formed or fleshed out in a way that dives deeper than the service level.  I think keeping the episodes to 30-35 minutes, picking a direction, and diving deeply into exemplifying the perils of police brutality, social division, social media etc., will allow you to have a greater impact that trying to ham-fist as many elements into each episode as possible.  Keep tackling the hard topics, but focus your scope. 

**4. Don't be afraid to use parables**

Serling was constricted in what he was allowed to talk about which forced him to become creative in the ways he told stories.  This constriction proved to be a strength as it allowed him to communicate difficult messages to people who otherwise may not have listened. Rather than talk about the dangers of McCarthyism he showed people on an average block who were afraid of an unseen evil. Rather than overtly discuss the evil of racism, he showed how one hate crime could turn an entire town dark.  Rather than confront people's fear of immigrants he used an alien who came to earth in need of help.  Rather than....well you get the point.  Serling was masterful using parables to communicate messages that ran deeper than surface level viewing.  I think using this device would not only enhance the show, it would increase conversation and repeat viewing.

359,"Fuck it, I’m going in head first at this episode. I think it’s called replay, I don’t care enough to check the full title. 

It sucks that I have to make this disclaimer, but my hatred for the episode has nothing to do with its themes and meanings. TZ has always had political and social commentary hidden behind the sci-fi. I think the theme was both current era appropriate as well as something I think should be discussed. 

The first half of the episode I actually enjoyed. The cop was genuinely scary, the main character trying to figure out what happened is a TZ cliche that really doesn’t annoy me. 

The other half made me want to rip my hair out. The entire uncle character should’ve been cut. My god that entire scene where they were planning they’re way into the college felt so out of place. I seriously wanted to close the app because I felt like I was watching a zombie movie. 

Then the climax scene with the police showing up... was just.. so ridiculously corny. The weird triumphant music while the main characters speech to evil by using “emotions” and “love” was so incredibly annoying to me. It falls so flat because it’s so unrealistic, nobody talks like that in real life. A cop or someone who has such a huge power trip wouldn’t even bother to register the words coming out of her mouth. I hate to put Twilight Zone and Tumblr in the same sentence, but that ending could’ve been written by Tumblr and I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. 

How could they butcher such a good first part with a pointless ending and an even more pointless epilogue (something that further pushed the episode from being a TZ one into a short film) 

I seriously think this entire episode would’ve worked if they made an hour longer, fleshed out the uncle character, changed the title to something else, and completely remove the episode from the Twilight Zone brand and Peeles narration.

361,"Hey just a quick thought what are the dimensions and physical properties of the twilight zone. Like it seems like some kind of nebulous dimension that kid naps people and forces them to live out ironic morality plays for some sinister reason. Like does it feed off of the energy of the people it kidnaps and if so how many people does it kidnap per yer?

&amp;#x200B;

Given that there are a some rather fanatic worlds seen in the series does that mean that the twilight zone creates entire planets custom built as a set piece. What are the people on these planets made of and did they exist before the person arrives and do they continue to exist after the play is done? How much energy would that take to fuel?

&amp;#x200B;

Or is every one who ""enters the twilight zone"" trapped in a imaginary world in their own mind. If that's the case is each episode the dream of separate person. Given that the original series  has 156 episode does that mean that something rendered 156 separate unconscious at the same time? Or is this spread over decades people randomly falling asleep and never waking up, or do they wake up at the end of a episode. I think I just described sleeping. I'll admit im high and just finished watching the episode and these are the questions that im currently obsessed with.

&amp;#x200B;

Like do the npc's of the story just pretend not to notice when the person enters the twilight zone arrives .  Like that's Bill he runs a successful flurb business he wakes up in the twilight zone and the flurb's never existed and that's how Bill realized that the true meaning of Easter was friendship. Like the people  who make up the universe  where the flurb was never invented what the fuck do they think happened, Bill just had a break down and start going on about fucking flurbs? Like is this a normal thing for them is Bill always going on about imaginary shit or is this the first time? More importantly what the fuck happened to Bill the successful Flurb salesman. Did he just wake up and not recognize any thing in his life and what the fuck is a Flurb? How does Bob's the salesman family react to him not knowing anything about his own life?

do they flip back when he learns the secret to Easter or is a one way trip and they are forever stuck living in world that they are just slightly off from everything , where everything is almost right but juuuust off. Like when some one is visiting and they move your furniture two inches to the left and at the time you think nothing of it but as you lie awake a night it occurs that something is off in the living room and you will never know what it is and this is just your life [now.](https://now.Is)  Is their every waking moment a banal existential terror at the knowledge the universe is alive at it hates them and is petty enough to personally forever fuck up Bill the flurb salesman's life and his alternate flurbless double just so the salesman can learn the meaning of friend ship.

&amp;#x200B;

Would you take comfort that the universe is alive and you can prove it is fucking with you or do you worry constantly about what the universe going to fuck you over with next. Would knowing that the universe is sentient be comforting or pants shittingly  terrifying? Like knowing its sentient do you try to grab more of its attention or do  you do everything you can to never get noticed by it. Like do you see out other people that you know its paying attention to or do you run away and hide from them in a bid to make yourself uninteresting as possible. Fuck I think that's love craft.

386,"Some ground rules:

* You have to be specific. For instance, if you say ""I'd make the Comedian twenty minutes shorter,"" you have to explain what specifically you'd cut to make the story work within that time frame, and why that would make a better story.
* Remember, only one change per episode. It could be something as small as a single line, or something that would drastically alter the entire theme/plot. It has to be something you can first sum up in one sentence, and then elaborate as need be.
* No excessive negativity. ""I would make episode X not be trash""-type comments should be ignored. 
* If you only have ideas for one or two episodes, feel free to just do those.

Example:

(this is the thing I'd change for The Comedian)

**I would cut the nephew character completely**. I think every other ""erasure"" in the episode serves to advance the plot/characterization, except this one. The dog disappearing establishes the premise. Joe Donner shows that the power could be used for good, the mentor shows how it could be used for bad, the two businessmen show how just far Samir's morals have fallen, etc. The only disappearance that truly feels repetitive IMO is the nephew's. All it really does is let Samir understand what's happening, but I think they easily could've had him figure it all out after Donner disappeared, and he would've had almost exactly the same conversation with his girlfriend afterward as he did after the nephew. It would also make Samir more sympathetic in the beginning, so his moral decline would feel more powerful. (Having him shrug off his nephew's erasure from existence makes him look so much worse than shrugging off the erasure of a guy who killed a mother and child.)",hithere297,You're allowed to change ONE aspect of each episode of the reboot in order to make it better.

30,"Hello! I've been binge watching this wonderful show the past few days, and despite watching and enjoying this show all throughout my life, I hadn't really sat down and really given the writing my full attention. It is really mind blowing how well most of the episodes hold up and how relevant they still remain today, and how emotionally effective many of them are.

My favorite script has been that of ""Eye of the Beholder"", as well as the performance of the lead actress- her vocal acting some is incredible. However, one line from another episode really grabbed me with its beauty. The intro to the episode ""A Passage for Trumpet"":

""Joey Crown: musician with an odd, intense face, whose life is a quest for impossible things, like flowers in concrete, or like trying to pluck a note of music out of the air and put it under glass to treasure.""

I replayed that last line several times. I don't know what it is, but that music metaphor and how it was delivered are just so beautiful to me.

The episode itself also affected me quite a bit. For anyone who hasn't seen it, it is about a downtrodden trumpet player in NYC, struggling with alcoholism and becoming suicidal. As someone who has dealt with those feelings before, it felt like I was meant to watch it. I felt for Joey and enjoyed the message of the ep. Anyway, with that said:

The Four of Us are Dying- I like that the main character uses his particular talent to simply mess with peoples heads.

The Trouble with Templeton- Similar to both Walking Distance as well as the Night Gallery episode They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar. Yet it gets mentioned by nobody at all.

The Jungle- The last half of this episode that features a lone John Dehner walking through a completely deserted city while being haunted by the sounds of an African jungle is truly mesmerizing to me.

Jess-Belle-Everyone hates this Season 4 episode but I love it. It is like mountain folklore and has almost a Shakespeare level of tragedy to it. Ya know who else liked it? Earl Hamner Jr, who wrote this episode as well as a hand full of other TZ episodes before going on to strike it rich with The Waltons.

3. He sees the people digging a grave for his dog Rip----\[RIP, Rest In Peace\] He tries to talk to them and later shoot them-----what would have happened if he pulled the trigger? Would just air and dust dissipate and nothing else? Or would have forfeited his chances for heaven altogether as he was trying to kill people----thou shalt not kill remember? 

4. He tries several times to talk to his wife, to no avail. It turns out Hyder Simpson and Rip are no longer alive at the very end and unable to go back to the land of the living.

5. Hyder follows the pall bearers bearing a coffin asking who's in it, but now he's mostly talking to his dog. Instead of finding the cemetery, he finds the other gate.

6. Hyder Simpson and his dog Rip died during the night, but neither knows it.

7. The episode ends with Hyder Simpson walking his dog up to heaven with him finally at peace having accepted that it is what it is, and he is dead and finished with life on earth. He's at peace and acceptance.

In short, Dr. Malcolm Crow from The Sixth Sense went through all of these same situations since the start of the movie The Sixth Sense. I know M Knight admitted that The Sixth Sense wasn't even his own idea, he stole the inspiration from Are You Afraid Of The Dark's Dream Girl, but yes the side by side comparison is uncanny and it fits with only a few minor infractions. Instead of almost---attempting to shoot people, Dr. Malcolm Crow actually breaks the glass on the door of his wife's jewelry store. Instead of seeing people digging a grave and grabbing coffins, Dr. Crow and Cole attend someone's funeral together. And Dr. Crow had no pets. 

And it is possible that Rip The Dog no offense to Cole The Kid, since Cole could see ghosts and dead people all the time, and knew Dr. Crow was dead all along through a variety of scenes without dialogue even though Dr. Crow didn't know he was dead and  it turned out, it was Cole's mission to help Dr. Crow move onto the other side with ease. Similarly, Rip could see right through the phony gates and Hyder didn't want to separate from him, and if he did, The Late Hyder Simpson would have ended up in hell instead of heaven and that was Rip's Mission, but then again, Cole had a pet dog of his own named Sebastian who seemed to have a sixth sense with haunted apartments as well.

The main protagonist was a Senator who was investigating some sort of company/campus where weird stuff was happening.

That’s about all I remember...I don’t even remember how it ends but I’ll never forget being surprised that a Senator had those kind investigative powers. Almost like he was a detective.

Nobody except Bolie can recall how the fight began, I guess if Henry went ahead and asked the opponent what really happened and what his recollection was it would open a plot hole, but that's neither here nor there when he tried to tamper with Henry's freewill by  telling Henry that he's too old to believe in magic----let Henry believe as he chooses Bolie!

Clearly, do the people who take to forums and complain that the beauty queen was homely and unattractive-----Did they miss the episodes Eye Of The Beholder and Number 12 Looks Just Like You? Enough said with that analogy, and who's to say that someone else's definition of beauty is wrong? How do we know that the astronaut who was complimenting her and her Plain Jane librarian looks doesn't actually like his girls homely and unattractive? Not everybody is attracted to supermodels some like their women to be on the plain side and others like women who are ugly. Maybe he sees beauty in what's plain, and if that was the case then that would make me like him and not care one way or another about his two friends. Now obviously, the girl in beauty queen segment always wanted to be beautiful when she was alive, didn't happen, couldn't afford plastic surgery so she stipulated in her will that she be placed on display winning a Miss America competition while her more beautiful contestants lose and look on in envy. So what's wrong with that?

Who was the mayor anyways? We know he wasn't even really a mayor, official or a person in charge of anything. What was he like when he was alive and isn't his story worth telling? Was he a young man who was constantly beaten down and bullied and only escaped as a man about town or a man in demand in his own fantasy? Clearly he wanted to be celebrated and in charge in life, never got the chance, so why not have it in death? He cast one shadow of mystery that could never be uncloaked, and the clock with no hands signifies he'll never leave office after election. This was his fantasy so why did it come to that? Why not ask to be president, or a king, or a sultan? How badly was he bullied in life and did he ever lash out? Seems he cared more about being celebrated, loved, adored and appreciated in life and it never came to fruition so why not get it after death?

I'm surprised they didn't try to finish off Season 5 with an episode where they do something where Serling goes from being effectively the host to a character in the show. They give some sort of hint why he's able to appear unnoticed in these stories, why he brings the Twilight Zone with him, etc. It feels like it could be equally well played for horror or laughs. 

It's not like it would have been too unusual at the time, since Jack Benny's program had been pretty popular for awhile and it was a meta-show.

For this, myself and many others feel this is one of the best episodes turning the focus from the supernatural to the frightening reality of the cold war. 

Unfortunately, what ruins it is the fact that the ending shows that there ARE aliens manipulating everything meaning that while they were targeting the wrong people, they weren't wrong and their initial suspension was correct.

1. First there's the original----well done, twilight zone with pig people and a beautiful face under bandages-----making for a compelling plot about loving all people. It could be looked at as a case of discrimination.
2. SNL: I don't know whether or not anyone remembers or if it should count or not as canon since it was just a sketch and a spoof, but Pamela Anderson did it. She was the girl under the bandages and we got a chance to see what the pig masks look like in color-----they take off the bandages to reveal Pamela Anderson but instead of being put off and horrified, all the male doctors fall in love with her and the female doctors look around and say, ""What's going on? I don't get it, what's happening?"" I can't forget this qoute: ""It'll be hard for me to go home to my pig-faced wife after seeing her!""
3. 2002----Twilight Zone. Same title, same name, different host Forest Whitaker. This is awkward to say the least. No pig masks, no pig people, no pigmayllion.

Anthony is still able to terrorize Peaksville, Ohio with his powers.

63,"Even with a few awkward moments along the way, to me this is the most emotionally powerful episode of the show. From the beginning where the grandmother is clingy, possessive of Billy, as broadly as its played it still manages to convey the mix of creepiness, sadness, and vulnerability someone in her position provides. The fact Billy's parents refuse to explain to him what's happening to his grandmother establishes the theme of the episode (the denial of death) perfectly. The way that we never hear the grandmother's voice come through the toy phone Billy uses to speak to her is perfect in adding ambiguity to the episode that made it more resonant for me. We don't know what's on the other side, and not making it explicit is utterly appropriate. 

Phillip Abbot's ""If you love him, let him live"" monologue is the best moment of the show for me. It's where the hook of TZ at its best (ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances) comes most alive to me, because its possibly the most nakedly someone breaks down in the face of the potentially supernatural circumstances they find themselves in. It's a guy talking on a toy telephone to someone he shouldn't believe is there, it's so undignified and yet the moment is so committed to that I can tear up thinking about it. The insignificant things that he lists off that Billy will never experience if his potentially desperately lonely grandmother keeps tap into some really primal emotions for me. I can even fully imagine the grandmother as she lets go and feel some inkling of how painful that would be.  

By the end, it doesn't even feel like it's a story about ghosts and the supernatural. It's about confronting and accepting the loss of loved ones, reaffirming life even in the face of the inevitable death we don't want to confront. Even shot on ugly video, it's so beautiful.

42,"I’m working with a guy who is going insane trying to find a Twilight Zone episode he vaguely remembers. I’d like to find out what it is and then not tell him as I enjoy withholding information and feeling extremely low-level powerful.

So the plot goes like this.

A kid is playing with a Morse code set in his bedroom. His mum comes in and goes, ‘Stop playing with that shit and come to dinner’.

He goes all bleary-eyed and says he just wants to contact his dad. His mum tells him to stop being a wanker and he knows his dad died in a naval battle intercepting some kind of Nazi Invasion fleet. The kid says he knows, but he’s still going to try.

He taps away at the Morse code set and twilight zone shit happens and the ship starts responding. He tells his father’s long-sunk ship to divert to avoid the Nazi fleet.

In what could only be described as an extreme breach of radio protocol his father’s ship acknowledges the message from a young boy in the future and changes its course. 

Then there’s a knock at the door and his dad comes in.

The kid is all like ‘dad you’re alive!’ And he says ‘of course I’m alive come to dinner FFS’ and the kid is really happy. The kid puts away the Morse code set and runs to dinner and FINDS NAZI SHIT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE HE HAS CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY AND THE NAZIS TOOK OVER. 

So, umm, anyone here know that episode? It’s driving my coworker crazy. Now I’m kind of interested as well.

2. I hope the show doesn't call back to previous TZ episodes too much.

I think anything that gets people interested in watching The Twilight Zone is a positive and If it can reach ""Black Mirror"" quality then holy crap, it's going to be a fun time to be a fan, as Black Mirror is the only show to rival the 1959 Twilight Zone series with its thought-provoking stories and A+ production quality.

I bought every book that I could find in hopes to dig deeper into his Radio Catalog, his Teleplay Catalog, etc. then His films beyond Planet of the Apes, Seven Days in May, etc - then there’s a book out just recently Rod Serling: His Life, His Work, His Imagination - and boy, oh boy is this pretty darn close to having his fully body of work, it’s 500+ pages but it isn’t intimidating at all, it’s a clean and smooth read, with synopsis of nearly everything else ever committed to the page. (And TZ only covers 1/5 of the pages in this book) I urge folks in this sub to pick it up - 

reading over my post this does seem like an ad but it’s not, I promise, I just really love this mans work a lot of writers talk about their mission to write about the human condition but rods work really nails it, and it’s a crime that his work isn’t more readily available for the masses, because all of it is still relevant today it still speaks to those who think themselves as the obsolete-man, The disenchanted, the lonely, the brave, the bold, the strange, the beautiful and the weird... his work is parables not of his time but our time...

 I hope that the more folks pick this up, the more it will show his estate that there is an interest in Rod’s work beyond that middle ground between light and shadow, beyond that pit of mans fears and above that summit of knowledge, that dimension of imagination and that area which we call the Twilight Zone.

15,"This is an episode from Season 4. I can say it's bad. Really bad. Before you read my analysis, go watch it. I'm not going to explain the plot, because I don't understand the plot. I'll give you a quick summary. One guy stops for gas in a small town that's guarding the secret of magical alien technology that can do essentially anything, and they detain him because he knows their secret. That's it. Let me say why it's bad.

The characters make bad decisions. Say everyone in your town has some magical Alien technology, and you're trying to keep it secret. What's the best way to keep a secret like that? This town has a completely OPEN ROAD leading into it. They simply assume that, due to their remote location, NOBODY will ever wander in and stop for gas or food. Is this stupid? Yes. It is established that these people can produce any food they want, any objects they want. They have no lack of resources, and nobody ever leaves, they're perfectly content. SO WHY DO THEY HAVE AN UNGUARDED ENTRANCE INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD? This would make sense: Put a log in the middle of the road, or a big rock, so people can't drive through, and a sign that says ""Road Closed"". Not their big giant magical invisible forcefield, as this would arouse suspicion, but just a barrier that makes it seem like there's nothing notable back there. Chances are they could just fade into obscurity like that. But they have a SIGN right outside! This is like if Area 51 had a day where you could come in and take all the pictures of aliens you wanted. These people are so bad at keeping a secret- and then, they imprison this guy just because he happened to pick out their town at random!

But it goes even farther than that. When he first gets to the town, this kid uses her magical alien technology to make the guy's dog disappear. The guy wonders how his dog disappeared, and he sees the kid playing with the techno-thingy, but her dad, the gas station attendant, says it's just her radio, and then she makes his dog come back. Now, this seems like a reasonable excuse. The guy assumes that maybe his dog just ran off somewhere for a minute, and maybe it is just a radio. So he drives off. THIS IS A SMART CHOICE. By this point, the guy doesn't care. He has his gas, and his dog. If the townspeople just let him go, he WOULD NOT CARE or think about visiting this town EVER AGAIN. He's a newspaper reporter, but he wouldn't report his dog running away in some little town. Seems like the townspeople have managed to keep their secret, right?

NOPE! They raise their HUGE INVISIBLE FORCE-FIELD, and his car literally CRASHES INTO NOTHING, then his dog DIES, then the townspeople bring his dog BACK TO LIFE. These people do not want to be thought of as normal, or hide a secret. This is clear. They want to be as bizarre as possible. This is the only thing I can conceive of. Are they idiots?

Dorn, the mayor, states in the episode, that they're not really evil, they just want to keep their secret. They don't want to keep him there, but they have to, in order to keep their secret. But he says he's a prominent reporter, and people will come looking for him. Won't they? Yes, they will. Dorn calls it the best kept secret in the world. Is it? Is it really? You leave your town wide open, you act insane, and you're so obviously hiding something. These people just want to stand out. They can't sorta want to hide their secret but also keep an open connection to the outside world. It's one or the other. 

The town has a hotel, and a restaurant, but they're not real! The hotel is supposedly ""completely booked,"" but all the guests are out, and the restaurant is ALWAYS CLOSED. Why does the gas station work, then? Why would these people need gas if they never go anywhere and can have all the food they want? Does this town NEED all these totally fake businesses everywhere to make their town seem more ""normal?"" It would seem more normal to have NO restaurant or hotel than to have restaurants and hotels that ARE FAKE. Some towns have no restaurants or hotels. They could just tell him, ""we don't have a restaurant or a hotel, so you'll have to go somewhere else."" He'd leave. Easy.

But that isn't the worst part. The worst part is, at the end of the episode, THEY REALIZE THAT THEY CAN JUST ERASE HIS MEMORY with their technology, and restore everything back to normal, so he won't know what's happened. This renders all the prior conflict completely pointless. Also, we're supposed to feel sad that he doesn't know the lady anymore. It would be sad if she was his wife BEFORE he entered the town, and she had to stay there. I'm not invested in their romance. He's just some random guy, and she's just some random lady, and she betrayed him anyway, and if they go their separate ways, then so what? It's a happy ending. 

Overall, this episode is bad. Serling and Co. really struck out with this one. Twilight Zone episodes are good when he characters do believable things. We cheer on the people when they leave Pall's imaginary apocalypse, we praise Templeton when he decides to pursue his passion, we identify with the guy who's alone with nobody but his reflection to speak with. Those are good episodes. This episode is bad because nobody does anything that makes sense. It could be good if it was executed properly, like if the townspeople really did try to keep their technology a secret and did everything in their power to help this poor guy escape. 

Dorn says that the last time anybody wandered in, it was 1953. What happened to that guy? Did they turn his car into Spaghetti-Os and then tell him nothing was bizarre? ",Iamnotthethe,Valley Of The Shadows sucks.,1543255448,12,True,TwilightZone,2018-11-26

42,"SyFy regularly airs Twilight Zone on it’s early morning programming. However, each episode has about two minutes cut out for commercials. I think season 4 episodes, the hour long ones, have 4-5 minutes cut.

Mute is especially bad. The first 2 minutes were cut the last time I saw it. This is where the parents are sitting around a table, discussing the idea of raising a child without communication. It explains the whole point of the episode, but if it’s cut, how would the viewer know that?

I also believe the Midnight Sun had the scene where Mrs Brunson collapses to the floor and dies from heat stroke cut from the episode.

I haven’t seen either episode recently on SyFy, so the cuts may be different now. ",annabelltaylor2019,Worst syndication cuts,1544138439,2,True,TwilightZone,2018-12-06

49,"So in this hypothetical situation, you would be transported to the setting in the episode that your character appears in.

You can choose to play out the entire episode, or just certain scenes from it. However, everything that occurs in the episode also happens to you, there’s no changing anything to your added benefit.

You can also choose to leave the episode setting and return to your normal life at any time.

Which character would you like to experience being for a short time?

I would personally choose Henry J Fate from “Mr Denton on Doomsday”. You get to help out a down on his luck Al Denton and having access to all those potions and tonics seems cool.

Other fun choices to me are Gabriel from “A Passage for Trumpet” (being an angel and a great musician), Frisby (coming up with crazy stories and actually being abducted by aliens), and Gregory West (being able to make anything come to life by describing it).

54,"“TZ” season 5, Ep. 11 The 7th is Made up of Phantoms. 

At the 10min 8 second mark MSG conners and Capt. Dennet are conversing about the Indians. 

I find it strange how the camera changes angles and zooms in on Capt Dennets face. 
It seems like something else was said and some type of censoring took place. 

When the camera cuts to the close up (which I believe was inserted afterwards) Capt Dennets says something surprisingly nice 

“ if you see any Indians can you take it slow ( cut to close up) because they’re all college graduates, and they’re probably running tests on the soil. “ 


This seemed like an odd thing to say at the moment... iv come to Reddit for answers.


Does anyone know if my intuition about a previous line being censored is correct?
