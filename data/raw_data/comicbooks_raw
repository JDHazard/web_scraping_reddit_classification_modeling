45,"To me, it's not so much a superhero's powerset or costume that make them interesting, but their backstory, personality and attendant themes. To me, it doesn't matter if a superhero has a similar powerset and/or costume to another superhero, if their story is original and thought-provoking. It is for these reasons that I prefer Sentry and Blue Marvel over Superman. Sure, their powers are basically the same as his, but their premises, I believe are far more engaging than Superman's has ever been.

Superman is just a goody two-shoes 1950s boy scout. Insufferably wholesome, righteous, chivalrous, infallible; always doing the right thing, incapable of thinking a bad thought; he rescues cats from trees and helps old ladies across the street and everyone loves him. (And yes, I know that I'm generalizing here - that there *is* more to Superman than this and that there have been some very in-depth explorations into/defences of his psyche and *why* he acts the way he does over the years, so don't flame me, Superman fans - but the above is the basic spirit of him).

Sentry and Blue Marvel, on the other hand, seem to have far more creative, nuanced, serious personalities and backstories to me. Think about it. Sentry was an unemployed, overweight, middle-aged, drug-addled loser who essentially created his persona to escape from the crushing mediocrity of his life (plenty of room for commentary here on the escapist aspect of the superhero genre), who was present during the entirety of his world's superhero history but was forced to retroactively erase himself from it, and who now struggles with mental illness and a constant battle with the dark side of his own self. Blue Marvel, meanwhile, was a black man who possessed superpowers during the Civil Rights era, and could have used them to rise up against white people, yet made the choice not to, even as he incurred the scorn of both his own people and white people and was forced to give up his career by the president due to the latter's fear, and who was eventually forced to battle his own former best friend when said friend attempted to found a world free of racism.

To me, the latter two simply come off as possessing far more interesting pasts and far more psychological complexity than Superman. To me, the premises of the latter two come off as involving far more interesting themes and subjects, which could be spun off into far more interesting storylines. There's far more moral ambiguity and far fewer easy ways out.",fastzander,"Sentry and Blue Marvel are more interesting than Superman, IMO.",1552998849,21,True,comicbooks,2019-03-19

53,"Hi :-)

Begin rant / memories.

in the late 80s early to mid 90s, I would buy comic books at newsstands mostly.  

At the time in the late 80s early 90s, you could buy a comic for 1.25 or 1.75.  

I was the dummy that never filled out a subscription card to follow the stories.

I would just buy whatever i could afford, which was more than now with inflation.

My point is that my local comic book shop tends to be high with back issues of comics.

I have ren and stimpy comics from 1993 that i bought for $2.00 a issue sometimes $3.00.

I also have some xmen comics from 1993.  Those were more expensive.  

The local place i go to sells them for $4.00 to $5.00 an issue!

Yes i know there is digital but im not buying a tablet to read a comic and would have to rotate it etc just to get it to display properly.

Trying to remember this comic that I read many years ago that's set in the Spiderman universe and can only remember some details.

Essentially it's about the villains of Spiderman talking in a bar about their encounters with him. I remember one prominent villain is The Vulture. There was also another villain, I can't quite remember, that was retired and had a son that wanted to revive his father's villain persona. 
I also remember the book ending with Norman Osborn listening to the stories at the bar and finishing it off by saying that he killed Spiderman's wife/girlfriend in front of him.

I've read several books from many of the characters that I like, but I want to try something new here. I know people ask that all the time: ""Who's you favorite?"" but I'm hoping to find some new stories about characters that I probably haven't read much of.

So who is your favorite character (or team) and which comic would you recommend that I read so that I too could fall in love with them?

I'd like to pick up a trade if I could, because that's super easy, but if there's some great examples of single issues than that's fine. Also, I mostly read Marvel and DC and that's what I prefer, but I'm not opposed to other characters from other publishers.

60,"Imagine if Marvel did what they did with the Ultimate Universe (launch an entire new self contained universe of books) but instead of your contemporary high gloss and richly colored books they revert to the old school four color newsprint. 

 If you punch 12 cents from the 60s into an inflation calculator you get about a dollar in today's money.  I'd have to assume a powerhouse like Disney could get four color printed and be able to make a profit at $1.

Retro sales big these days.  They might even find success advertising the new line up in larger non traditional avenues, aimed at bringing new readers just like Ultimate did.

That's assuming that they hired a talented stable of creators. Writers who really have something to say and artists who are interested in experimenting with the four color aesthetic.  If the titles become nothing but advertisements for the MCU, or low effort SJW stories then it would surely fail.

I mean even if they started such an ambitious project with ten separate titles, you could buy all of them each month for the price of two modern books.  They'd be so cheap to stock they might even be able to try to push the lineup into gas stations again.

1. The run ends as a result of the event and a new creative team takes over like a breath of fresh air. This one is going to be pretty heavily determined by what creative team does the taking over but so long as the change was at least facilitated by the event I think that counts. 
1. And finally, the same run, with the same team (or at least the same writer) manages to take what happened during an event and apply it to their character and the run is actually better off for it. Something specific, that changes the status quo of the character, like someone coming back from the dead or a shocking revelation about someone's origin or whatever, so long as the run is improved.

Truly massive collections of Conan, Buffy, Eerie, Creepy, Lone Wolf and Cub, and Hellboy. Lots of Mask, Tarzan, Avatar the Last Airbender, Usagi Yojimbo, Smurfs, Elf Quest,  and many more. There are also lots of Manga, and various Dark Horse superheroes.

What they do not have is Marvel, DC, and Star Wars. But a huge portion of the population has Amazon prime. One of the many features of Amazon Prime is Prime Reading, which includes over 250 graphic novels, many from Marvel, DC, and Star Wars.  Note that those are graphic novels, many are hundreds of pages long, so this maybe more than a thousand comics. You can download 10 at any one time. New ones are added, and I believe old ones are taken off. So over time you have access to a much bigger collection.

Your public library usually has a large collection of comics, including Marvel, DC, and Manga. The library system for a neighboring county to me has six to seven thousand graphic novels. I believe that about half the population of America lives in library service area as large or larger than that county. So half the population should have access to a collection like that.

145,"I did a quick search and couldn't find much discussion on it, and most of the talk here seems centered around Marvel and DC books, but I thought I'd ask anyway for the following reasons.

I was able to follow it fine up to issue six, but starting with issue seven, things have gotten very confusing. I reread the entire series so far a number of times and I am still at a loss. It makes sense up to issue six. There IS stuff in there that's not spelled out, but it seems to be intentionally vague to create a sense of mystery or because it's scary, supernatural weirdness. But starting in issue seven a plot point was introduced that is very unclear to me, and I was wondering if anyone could explain to me what exactly is meant to be going on? The characters in the story themselves seem to understand it fine from their reactions, so either I'm just not getting it personally or, well, the writing is just poor here. As I said, up to this point things made sense and when something was unclear, the characters in the story didn't understand what was going on either. But in issue seven . . . stop reading here, as I am going to get into spoilers.

In issue seven, Carnahan seems to be revealing that the dead refugee couple were in fact the modern holy family, and that their dead newborn was meant to be the Second Coming of Christ. Carnahan killed them because he's the Anti-Christ. Apparently, all the child killing stuff was irrelevant, and Carnahan just partook in it because ""the vessel"" (mean Carnahan's physical body?) just enjoyed it. 

This leaves me very confused because Carnahan says a number of other things that implies he is not, nor has he ever been, Carnahan. He seems to say that he is the Anti-Christ, a separate being from Carnahan, and possessed Carnahan's body after he killed the refugee baby so Jesus couldn't use Carnahan as his vessel instead. This is very confusing for a number of reasons. First, the Anti-Christ thanks Shaw for killing Carnahan, implying that he emptied the vessel of a soul so he could possess it instead of Christ. 

There's a number of problems with this. One, if Carnahan and the Anti-Christ are separate beings, wouldn't Carnahan's soul still be occupying his body? So if Christ can't take the body now that the Anti-Christ occupies it, how could Christ take the bod if Carnahan's soul was still in it? 

Second, why would Christ's second choice for a vessel be a sadistic child killer who works with pedophiles to murder kids? Some random middle-aged guy is a weird choice, why not just be born to some other couple? But even if you accept that some middle-aged guy is a good second option, why a child killer? I know Ennis isn't a fan of Christianity and puts blasphemy into his comics for fun, but this doesn't seem like an attempt to be edgy or shock, ala Preacher. It seems like Ennis is attempting to write a straight-faced religious horror story and in that context, why would Christ want to occupy the body of a serial killer who is under investigation by the police for connections to pedophiles who murder kids? Wouldn't that make ministering to his flock or fighting the Anti-Christ even more difficult than it otherwise would be? 

Third, I'm not even sure if Carnahan and the Anti-Christ are meant to be separate beings because one moment, Carnahan talks like he is the Anti-Christ who is just now occupying Carnahan's newly dead body, but in issue eight he talks about murdering his family as a child because he was the Anti-Christ all his life. This would also make sense of his supernatural ability to make witnesses to his activities go on shooting sprees and the pedophiles he worked with commit suicide. It's pretty inconsistent and leaves me very confused. 

Fourth, why is Carnahan and/or the Anti-Christ continuing to fuck with the police? He killed Jesus, so it's it kind of mission accomplished? Why is he doing weird, spooky shit in this warehouse? Isn't he just drawing unnecessary attention to himself? If you were the Anti-Christ, wouldn't you want everyone to be ignorant of the fact you'd stopped the Second Coming? By drawing attention to it, wouldn't you just give people faith in God? And for that matter, why do all the pedophile serial killer stuff? Again, isn't that just drawing unwanted attention to yourself if the real goal is just stop Jesus from redeeming mankind?

Anyway, I'm just really baffled by all this. Ennis is one of my favorite comic book writers and I've never been this confused by his writing before. Is there something I'm missing? If you're reading the book so far and it makes perfect sense to you, can you fill me in on what's up?

150,"Let me tell you about Bad girls art ,According to comic vine which I quote 

&amp;#x200B;

""*an edgier version of Good Girl Art, focusing on sexy and scantily-clad female characters who are known for morally ambiguous and violent behavior.""*

&amp;#x200B;

and also from Wikiquote 

&amp;#x200B;

"" *""Bad girl"" characters dress in revealing costumes, possess shapely physiques, are morally ambiguous, wield supernatural powers or are of a supernatural nature, and have no compunction about killing their enemies* ""

&amp;#x200B;

In other words Bad girls art was considered a popular trend during the 90's where it has sexy women who are anti-heroines  wearing scantily clothing and likes to kill bad people 

Example of bad girl art are the female characters from zenescope,Witchblade, Glory and Avengelyne,  from image comics during the 90s and Lady death and those which are used for adult content and are now published in boundless comics like Lookers and webwitch.

&amp;#x200B;

So eventhough the trend is in decline ,some are still there especially when there is one that pays homage to the genre called vampblade and is published in Action labs

&amp;#x200B;

But let me tell you why I don't like about bad girls art.Its considered sexist because this trend makes female characters look like sex object as they reveal scantily clothing with sex appeal.And they just do sexy poses in covers.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a current time due to the #metoo movement where women must not be sexually assaulted and will be treated equally with men,They are human beings.We also have a time where female super-heroines are considered as role models like wonder woman and Captain marvel (carol danvers)  

&amp;#x200B;

288,"Brian Azzarello is a fairly well-known comic book writer in this day and age, authoring popular comics such as *Joker (2008)*, *100 Bullets*, and a considerable run on New 52's *Wonder Woman*, and even lesser known comics galore. 

Azzarello's penchant for going ""edgy"" places with his comics is known by some, but after reading through many of his comics I see that it is a far more recurring aspect of the man's writing than I've ever seen discussed. 

[As seen in this compilation (NSFW)](https://m.imgur.com/a/mTJNPnn), Azzarello has a very recurring, very strange schtick for adding abuse and sexual violence into his stories. From the ruination of the Amazon's origins in *Wonder Woman* to his strange choice to have Batman grope a woman to distract attackers in *Batman/Doc Savage*, Azzarello obviously and routeinely inserts content like this into his comics, not even getting into the many occurrences in *100 Bullets* of rape and violence. 

Note that I am not calling Azzarello's writing quality into question here. But the fact that he blatantly and needlessly injects such freakish content into writing throughout his career is something I have not often seen brought to light, and this compilation that took me barely an hour to make is proof that the man's reputation for edginess and shock value are most certainly not exaggerated.

&amp;#x200B;

Posted from a throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days ago, I was banned by a known ptyrant over at /r/marvel who likes to try to suppress any opinions and sources that don't follow the left-leaning line. I wrote out a calm, reasonable, and most infuriating to them \*rational\* essay about the growing influence of identity politics keeping Marvel in the red.

&amp;#x200B;

No surprise, I was banned under the bullshit rationale that I was being “political” and a “comicsgater”.

&amp;#x200B;

Well well well, I replied to the ban and talked to a much more reasonable mod who \*100% took my side\*. Unbanned on the spot! It turns out they are just as tired of their SJW mod as the comics community is tired of identity politics in general!

&amp;#x200B;

The best part? The absolute best part? This morning, I log in and see that their big, stickied weekly discussion thread has been edited with a \[\*\*Resignation letter\*\*\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/b2y99c/new\_marvel\_comics\_and\_releases\_for\_march\_20th/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/b2y99c/new_marvel_comics_and_releases_for_march_20th/)) from that mod. Looks like the rest of them finally got tired of being force-fed Kool-Aid!

301,"Has anyone had issues receiving their subscriptions from Midtown Comics? 

In November I ordered subs to both Guardians of the Galaxy and Friendly NBhd Spider-man for my 2 boys as Christmas gifts. I chose these as they were both starting new runs in January and they were advertises as ""order now to start with issue #1!). Spider-man came out around the 9th of January and after not receiving it by the first week of February, I emailed an inquiry to Midtown. They basically said I had to wait 4 weeks before asking (so, keep waiting). It was 24 days, so not quite 4 weeks, but I was still a bit peeved by the whatever attitude. The issue finally showed up after 5 weeks and the 2nd issue showed up the next day, haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guardians was released the last week of January. When it didn't show up at the end of February, I just kept waiting since I knew that is what Midtown would tell me. A couple more weeks went by without receiving it, so I finally reached out to them to see what was up. Their response was "" Note all issues ship on their release date and can take up to 4 weeks to reach its final destination. Customers have up to 6 weeks from an issues release date to reach out to us regarding any damaged/missing issues. We are currently outside the claims window for Issue 1.....  although we will extend a courtesy for you"" . 

Aww, gee thanks? They said they would ship the missing issue if it was still in stock, or extend the sub by 1 if they couldn't ship. 

That was 10 days ago, so I reached out to them again. Their response, "" In our previous exchange, we mentioned that Issue #1 was outside the claims window, but will extend a courtesy for you. We have the issue in stock and can re-send, or we can extend your subscription by 1. Please confirm with how you would like to proceed from here. ""

&amp;#x200B;

 WTH, why would I have to re-confirm that I wanted the items that I originally ordered? Isn't my original complaint enough confirmation that I still want my order? Are these guys in the business of accepting payment for orders, not shipping them and then expecting the customer to confirm that they still want what they ordered?

Additionally, issue #2 was supposed to be here by yesterday (according to their 4 week shipping timeframe. I am in Cleveland, BTW, not too far from NY), and it has not arrived, so there is another claim I will have to deal with (at least I am still within their timeframe, so I won't have to hope for any ""courtesy"" extended in order to get what I paid for)

&amp;#x200B;

Just a bit of a rant. Was wondering if anyone else has had issues with this company and if they ended up being taken care of?

&amp;#x200B;

 Where else can subs be ordered from? I thought I was ordering from Marvel, but they apparently use Midtown to fill their orders?

349,"So I read the following just to give you a list: **Captain America** (all of Golden, lil bit of Silver, and all of Bronze), **Sandman** (all of Golden and Bronze), **Challengers of the Unknown**, **Thor** (#131-140, Annual 2, 154-179), **Fantastic Four** (1-93, Annuals 1-7), **X-Men** (just the 1st ish), **SHIELD**, **Atlas**, **Kobra**, all of the **Fourth World Saga**, **Demon**, **OMAC**, **Kamandi**, **Losers**, **Days in the Mob**, **Eternals**, **2001**, **Machine Man**, **Devil Dinosaur**, **Black Panther**, **Silver Surfer** (that last one he did with Stan Lee), **Captain Victory**, **Silver Star**, **Super Powers**, **Destroyer Duck**, and **The Prisoner**.

&amp;#x200B;

I also got some opinions if anyone wants to talk about them:

&amp;#x200B;

* First off, any comics that I haven't read that you think I should be him? I'll gauge my taste from what I liked best to what I hated the most: Best - OMAC, To Wake the Mangog, Silver Star. Worst - Golden Age Sandman, X-Men, Devil Dinosaur.
* So Challengers of the Unknown is an obvious template for Fantastic Four. Like even down to the random aliens that picked up the Challengers is somewhat used again in FF. 
* The Fourth World Saga is an obvious continuation of Thor though a lot of the characters in the Fourth World saga feel like reinterpretations of many other Marvel characters. Orion felt like the Hulk, getting uncontrollably angry at times. Lightray felt like a more mild version of the Human Torch. Darkseid felt like Dr Doom a little only way more tamed down in terms of showboating egotism.  Mister Miracle felt like a way nicer and less sexist Mr Fantastic, right down to the way he would science his way out of things and his relationship with Big Barda, who felt like Thor meets Susan Storm. Highfather was a far nicer Odin. Desaad felt like Loki. The Forever People felt like a hippie version of The Challengers of the Unknown. Big Bear felt like the antithesis to The Thing.
* So I know that many people believe that Hunger Dogs is the ending to his Fourth World Saga but like Super Powers picks up like right after. Also that Darkseid land felt like the inspiration for Grant Morrison's far-future JLA story where Darkseid won.
* Devil Dinosaur felt like a poor-man's Kamandi.
* Those humans with super powers in Kamandi felt like a super powered version of Challengers of the Unknown.
* Darius Drumm was like the insane ending to the constantly evolving symbolic characters that represented fascism for Jack Kirby. I mean, obviously it started with Red Skull, then Dr Doom strangely enough, Hydra, Kobra, then Darkseid, and finally Darius Drumm. Am I missing anyone? Would the Mad Bomb count from Cap America? Maybe some of the baddies in The Losers I guess...
* Silver Star was the most meta and experimental I've seen with Jack Kirby in terms of storytelling. It was fucking insane.
* Captain Victory was the most Kirby in terms of art I've seen from him from the 80s.
* Jesus christ 2001 was insane.
* OMAC is easily my favorite thing by Kirby.
* Outside of the Mangog and Galactus vs Ego stories, I didn't care for Thor.
* Was anyone else let down with The Losers?
* So I noticed in many of his earlier works that hypnotism is like a really big way of dealing with enemies. I saw it quite a bit for some characters in his Golden Age Captain America and in Challengers of the Unknown its used as the most random way to beat enemies. In FF, they use it to defeat the Skrulls, Doom, the Doom uses it, Miracle Man uses it, etc. And then hypnotism was used many times in others stories too. It just seems very prevalent in his stories. Any one else notice that?",upyours192,I just read all the Jack Kirby comics I own. What else by him should I read?,1553251156,8,True,comicbooks,2019-03-22
351," Fairly new to reading comic books  and just gave ""one of the worsts comics"" a shot. Since it looked like a fairly short read, enjoyed the dynamic that I saw in the original civil war movie and it seemed appropriate since the Captain Marvel movie is currently just out in theaters and she happens to be one of the most controversial figures from that comic. While I'm fairly new to comic books, I am not to storytelling and characters from other mediums. So right now I'm feeling confident enough to have an opinion on characters from this series since I seem to have a very strong opinion that goes against almost everybody's take I've seen on this. And while  I agree that it's far from the best story ever told and could've been executed far better given the premise, I, however, cannot for the life of me imagine how anybody can think that Captain Marvel is in the wrong here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd argue that the only good thing that Tony did was investigate how the powers of the inhuman works, which to be fair, Carol couldn't really do on her own since she lacked the talent to do so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, while both of them lose someone near and dear to them, Only Tony seems like he's acting out of emotions.and while that might be very understandable given the context, it really isn't really a good point in his favor here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Captain Marvel acts proactively to prevent disasters from happening and saves countless lives in doing so. Yes, she arrests people for crimes they haven't committed yet but I don't see how that's different from arresting a suspect for a murder/bomb threat/ shooting. These people aren't convicted, they're simply put under-arrest while the heroes figure out the situation. One could even argue from the perspective that planning to commit murder is considered a crime but I don't have to since I don't need to do so to defend Carol's action here.  She isn't convicting people for crimes they didn't commit, she's simply putting them under arrest.    


Contrast that to Tony, who spends most of his time demonizing Carol and whose only argument seems to be: "" Captain America is on my side therefore I am right"".  Hell it's even revealed later that he trusted Carol with the situation but wouldn't trust someone else with that same responsibility (yet wasn't able to articulate those thoughts?). 

The nail in the coffin is towards the end when Captain Marvel seems to be remedying the situation with spider-man and Captain America but gets attacked by Iron Man, ""The good guy"".  Then gets his ass kicked.   


You can't even argue that Carol is a Mary Sue because she gets humbled quite a few times during this series. Honestly it kinda reminds me of the absolute hatred people had for Korra from the Avatar series. People seem to really hate the cocky, brash, confident and strong female lead no matter how well its executed and will hate the character regardless.  

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell am I missing here? I can see how people didn't think the comic was good,  that's a whole other subject, but thinking the Captain Marvel was so in the wrong that it made you hate her, I cannot for the life of me understand this position.

I'm hoping I can get a more constructive discussion/reasoning  here.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, here we go... Tony Stark is Science Skrull.

Four Skrulls land on earth.

One is killed in the car crash with Fury and Talos joins Carol and the gang and flies off into space.

That leaves Science Skrull and the 'Mystery fourth Skrull'.

The Skrull that fights Carol on the train is Science Skrull. He was wearing the same unique uniform and when the four transformed on the beach he changed into the human that fought Carol.

People believe that the Skrull that impersonated Carol in the house and was shot by Yon Rogg was Science Skrull.

So that means the fourth Skrull landed on the beach and just... vanished? Thats a pretty big plot hole.

&amp;#x200B;

No.

The one shot by Yon Rogg was the fourth Skrull. He had a different voice to Science Skrull and different head markings. His job was to distract and delay Yon Rogg.

Science Skrull was left behind on Earth.

Science Skrull (although made to look goofy by overlooking an 'obvious' answer) was able to convert a prototype jet for space flight, with scram jets and anti gravity, in a matter of a couple of hours. No one in the MCU can do that except for Tony Stark.

Tony Stark is also the only character in the MCU shown working with power tools in his factory/lab, wearing his trademark black goggles. You know, goggles on, power saw in hand, sparks flying.

Theres a million different things they could have shown Science Skrull doing. But for those couple of seconds they showed [Science Skrull doing this...](https://i.imgur.com/AMcMpfP.jpg) Black goggles. Power tool. Work bench. Sparks. Just like Stark.

&amp;#x200B;

A further stretch:

""Skrulls have to see a person before they can transform into them.""

Yes. The neighbour that came to Rambeau's door actually was the fourth Skrull. Carol could sense it. But that let the fourth Skrull see Carol and, as such, be able to transform into Carol.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise we are left with ""The fourth Skrull landed on the beach and just vanished.""

13,"So after completing this series, I feel a little mixed. I've come to really enjoy limited run Superman stories ala ""Secret Identity"" and while I enjoyed elements of this story especially in the beginning, Clark learning how to fly, some things I really thought were unnecessary. I didn't like that so many people knew about Clark's powers, the entirety of issue #2 I thought was overly dark and could have been executed better or left out entirely, while it was nice seeing Clark drinking and having fun because that was a good way of humanizing him the serendipity of having him pretend to be Bruce I felt was less charming and more of a reach. The comic does a better job of showing how established characters meet in issue #4 where we see great portrayals of Lex Luthor and a fun aside with Dick Grayson. Issue #5 was good with showing how Clark learns to become a hero and work with police but then #6 doubles down on what I didn't like from previous stories and has Clark's Smallville friends chat about him being Superman. Finally, Issue #7 shows Lobo \*Cue audience cheering\* whose anecdote about pissing in the skulls of long dead Kryptonians while in character I think was a bit over the top for my liking. I know I'm probably in the wrong about this but when I read that part I was taken out of the whole experience and just had to say wtf?

Marvel

Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze and Danny Ketch, had the whole 2006-2009 run up until and including Heavens on Fire at one point.  Didn’t like Robbie Reyes or the other girl one)

Moon Knight (had almost entire run of his series too)


Dr. Strange 


DC

Lobo (bought the new 52 issue 1 where its a new Lobo,  never followed up after that)

John Constantine (read alot of his Vertigo stuff,  haven’t read any of the DC stuff)

Wonder Woman



Comics I read and disliked recently
Harley Quinn Rebirth (love the character,  thought the first TPB was garbage)
Jimmys Bastards (not quite as good as Preacher or the Boys)

Comics I read recently and liked
Saga (kind of intimidated to catch up on though)

51,"Hello r/comicbooks! Welcome back to the Weekly Recs &amp; Relaxation thread. I hope you've all been well! Let's take a look at what our mod picks for the week are:

First we got /u/mikerapin coming at us with **O Human Star by Blue Delliquanti**

&gt; Imagine waking up one day to find out you've died and become a robot that looks and feels exactly as you did when you were alive. What questions would you ask? How would you feel? Blue Delliquanti delivers a powerful, emotional story of the relationship and history between two business partners and a futuristic world where sentient robots are the norm.

I for one have never heard of this book before but wow, that sounds like some wild sci-fi!

Next, /u/llamaentity recommends all of read [The Longest Day of the Future by Lucas Varela](http://www.fantagraphics.com/longestdayofthefuture/#/product/2607)

&gt; The future world is ruled by two corporate factions at odds with one another, and we follow two people as they attempt to infiltrate their opposition. There are no words and the narrative is confusing early on, but Varela’s gorgeous designs are so smooth and perfect that it’s easy to get lost in the bizarre future he has envisioned. It’s brutal, violent, darkly humorous, and often just plain weird, and I loved every single page.

Fantagraphics releases a lot of high quality books that aren't talked about very often in this sub, but totally deserve to. No time like now for you to check them out!

/u/kralben is coming in hot with **Ultimate Comics: X-Men issues 1-33 (the whole run)**.

&gt; For all the ups and downs the Ultimate Universe have, it's strength was also showing that actions have consequences, rather than resetting to a status quo like comics typically do.  This run of the Ultimate X-Men (written by Nick Spencer (1-12) and Brian Wood (13-33) shows us the end of the X-Men as we know it in the Marvel Universe.  Mutants are hunted down and put into internment camps thanks to the actions of the Ultimate version of Rev. Stryker.  This (along with other connected events in the Ultimate Universe) leads to civil war, as shown in ""Divided we Fall, United We Stand"" and fundamentally changes the Ultimate Universe in ways that lasted until Secret Wars.  The second half of the run focused on Kitty Pryde and the remaining mutants starting their own Utopia, fighting for their freedom against both the US Government and a foreign country lead by Jean Grey.  This run is bombastic, with huge stakes.  Much of the Ultimate Universe was flawed from the start, but runs like this show why the concept was worthwhile.

Sometimes we joke that the only good things to come out of the Ultimate universe are Ultimate Spider-Man, the Maker, and Sam Jackson as Nick Fury. But kralben is here to show us that we shouldn't dismiss it out of hand like that!

I'm from India but have read a good chunk of American comics and Japanese manga, including almost every critically acclaimed series or popular comic books (Sandman, Watchmen, TDKR, Maus etc.).

Nothing amazed/entertained me more than EC's Sci-Fi comic magazines from the 50s. I just can't get enough of the science fiction genre, and every magazine contained 4 short stories of men lost in time, spaceships travelling millions of light years away from Earth, encounters with Aliens, and much more. The stories used to be detailed and text heavy, as was the norm at the time, but it rarely happened that a story from those comic books bored me even for a minute. 

The USP of these stories used to be the shocking twist endings, generally featuring a reveal in the very last panel.

So, I'm pretty sure this TV Show is much better.

To the fans of the comic: One more thing, if you're a big fan of the comic and for some reason didn't catch up on the trailers, don't worry about ""Not being what the comic is"", the first trailer ending scene pretty resumes what ""The Boys"" is about and the second trailer has two scenes with super-heroes pissing the ""adult"" stuff still there.

234,"Hi 

So, I’ve been reading comics for awhile. Christmas of 2018, I was going to order the whole entire prelude up to Hickman’s secret wars. However had to wait. So, I’m doing it now and a few things are going to be a problem. One of the comics would arrive 1 within 3 months, which is a concern, because this is the 2nd volume of Hickman’s Avengers. And it’s literally the one I have to read after the first. 1 to within 3 months is a long ass time. Who knows how long it could take? Another volume won’t arrive until the 29th of March. That’s a long time as well. I know March is around the corner, but that is really a long time. Another one would also arrive on the 25th, but that’s literally in a few days. For the one that would arrive in 1-3 months, I’m gonna ask my local comic book store if they have it. Thing is, if they don’t, should I wait? Should I just wait out those months if they don’t have it? If they do and it’s a cover I’m not looking for, should I still get it? I know stuff could change and low and behold you get it the day before, but still. Not sure what I should do. I’m also kind of avoiding digital, since I want the whole collection on paperback.

I now don’t come to expect much from Shyamalan at all, honestly, but I couldn’t help but be rubbed the wrong way.

328,"I finally got my hands on Superman's first appearance.

From what I have seen/read the most long-lasting thing about it has been the car Superman smashes against that rock.

Also, we get the canonical explanations for most of Superman's lore: Krypton (here only referred to as ""a distant planet"") is destroyed by ""old age"", a ""passing motorist"" discovers Superman and drops him off at an orphanage, Superman's physical structure is ""millions of years advanced"" which meant that no matter what all Kryptonians have ""titanic strength"" upon maturity. Butch refers to Superman as ""the devil himself"".

Early Superman was intense. In what is essentially the first panel, he has a woman bound and gagged. The early depiction of Lane as fierce and independent was quite surprising as well.

Is anyone interested in talking about the rest of the stories from that issue next? Or should I move on to Action Comics #2 and circle back? Or is there another issue of something that would make more sense for me to continue with?",DannyBasham,[Discussion][Action Comics #1](June 1938),1550623219,12,True,comicbooks,2019-02-19

My Answers: Hugo Pratt:  The cartoonist behind Corto Maltese, son of a kabbalist and a colonial policeman, forced by his dad to become the youngest soldier in the Italian army (he defected to the Allies when dad died). A very full, very robust life, all over the world.

Rob Liefeld: From fan to fan-favorite creator.  From Marvel to Independent. Those early Image days, the rise and fall with the market, and the rise back up.

342,"Okay, I know that I'm not the only one who noticed this or maybe my take is super wrong but I am wondering how you feel about the universe these two companies live in.

In DC Cosmic stuff feels very Star Trek or rather Optimistic Space.  Everything is very civil and orderly, the Guardians run a very tight ship.  No real Cosmic Dangers to really be concerned with.  Sure guys like Starro, Lady Styx and Imperiex are out there but there isn't really much pressure there (Starro was dealt with in a single issue, Lady Styx in 52 while Imperiex needed a whole event).  That being said, the thing that really sticks out to me is that all of these guys could be damaged by one person, usually Superman.  

Marvel on the other had feels very Star Wars or maybe more accurate Gritty Space.  Kings and queens via for cosmic power in politics, raiders and pirates roam the star system without check, and worst of all Galactus and various other celestials.  It feels very Lovecraftian with these unknowable cosmic dieties that with so much as a flick of their finger could wipe us out whole sale.  Guys like Captain America or Spider-Man have no chance of winning.

This is especially made clear in Infinity Guantlet where none of the heroes could possibly beat Thanos and the best chance we had was an Asgardian empowered Human, or Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer (both people endowed with Incredible Cosmic power).  Now while the same comparison could be made with Superman, he is closer to Cap and Spidey is that he is the everyman or Humanity's representative.

&amp;#x200B;

Now neither of these are better or worse than the others.  Lovecraft get's boring after a while, constantly seeing these immesurable cosmic dieties we have no way of combatting or the choke hold the Guardians of the Universe  have on DC Cosmic stuff is occasionally infuriating in concept (also my opinion on why I feel while Kyle Rayner's tenure as solo Green Lantern was great, it would have been cool seeing Kyle as a sort of sherrif in a post apocalyptic western town, trying desperatley hard to see it restrored and keep order, would have been his trial by fire also why Superman stuff, Grant Morrison's new Green Lantern or Omega Men are my Favorite Cosmic DC stuff not counting New Gods), they do provide their own unique flavor as to what you want to read today.

Superheroes having multiple comics was originally a way to get around the “one comic per month” rule, but they also made following the story harder, so it began to be phased out.

Is it for his badassery? Nope.

Is it for his crazy personality? Again, nope.

His fowl language? Nope.

I love Deadpool, because he is the ultimate example of coping with pain through humor. Deadpool is hurting. Constantly. Both physically *and* emotionally. Not only is he a giant, walking, talking, bleeding, bruised, puss-filled tumor, he deals with the emotional trauma of being an ugly freak, and also of the experiments that caused him to be that way in the first place. He has PTSD from those experiments, and once admitted that he can't sleep at night, and that he always has traumatic flashbacks to those horrific events. But even through all of that, he's still cracking jokes and making people smile (or groan) even if inside he's certainly not happy or okay. His superpower too causes him pain. Sure, he's effecfively immortal and can regenerate from anything, but that doesn't mean he can't feel the pain of those injuries anyways. In the movies alone, he's been blown up, torn in half, impaled through the brain, and had his hand chopped clean off. Even from all of that, he's still cracking jokes and one-liners. Surely as a way to cope with the excruciating pain.

There's also his mental health. Saying Deadpool is mentally unstable would one of the greatest understatements in all of the marvel and X-Men universes. He constantly struggles with the likes of PTSD, depression, schitzophrenia, ADHD, and anxiety on a daily basis (from what I see of him and know about mental health). And he doesn't have the luxury of alcohol to dull the pain. Or even drugs to treat his mental illnesses. Due to his ever changing brain chemestry, he can't take an antidepressant. Or a mood stablizer. He deals with his mental problems in full force, day in day out. And he still sticks through it like a trooper trying to be funny and wise cracking. This speaks to me on a personal level. I've never been in the best place mentally, and I see Deadpool as an inspiration to me. No matter how badly he gets maimed, tortured, mocked, insulted, beaten-up, whatever, he always pulls through with a grin on his face and something to say. 

Finally there's his emotional pain. Deadpool is up there with Batman as an extremely tragic character. Being raised in a broken home, dealing with cancer, losing multiple loved ones, being mentally unstable; those are just a few examples of exactly how depressing Deadpool actually is. But, once again, even through all that he still puts on a smile and makes light of it, even if it really hurts him.

Deadpool may not be the strongest, or smartest, or even the coolest. But to me, he's one of the most relatable, sympathetic, and endearing characters in all of comic books. In all of fiction, even.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was watching an interview of Garth Ennis and how it's no secret that he dislike superheroes. That explains ""The Boys"" a lot and the tone of the book. Anyways, it got me thinking, who are some other creators that don't like superheroes? Understandable, comics aren't just focused on just superheroes but it cannot be denied that they're most POPULAR of the medium. So there's going to be a creator or two that just don't can range from ""meh, kids stuff"" to a complete dislike or even hate for the superhero genre.

Where do you turn when a big huge company like ReedPop (Reed Exhibitions) that runs 500 events worldwide each year and has a gross income of 9.5 billion each year does you wrong?

This is a story that begins on October 6th last year at the NYC Comic Con, but in way it actually begins all the way back in 1974. 

I was sixteen years old back in 74 and attending my first Comic Book Convention in NYC. There I received the 100 page program book that I still have to this day. Back then artists and writers were only to happy to autograph your program for you, and many would throw in a quick sketch too. I was thrilled to get over 20 autographs that year including such luminaries as Neal Adams, Jeff Jones, and Jim Steranko just to name a few. 

While I never lost my love of comic books, I did drift away from them while in college and in the early years of raising a family. I returned to them in the early 90s and have attended many a convention since then. That program now contains over 200 different autographs and amazingly nearly 100 tiny sketches in the margins.

So when Alex Ross was doing a promotional signing of ""Marvelocity"" with Chip Kidd at the NYC Comic Con this past fall I jumped at the chance. He does so few signings and “Marvels” was one of my biggest favorites from the early 90s. Alex never charges a fan for an autograph, at this event you were purchasing the book from Penguin/ReedPop which he would sign. Also, he would sign an additional second item for you (I was looking forward to adding his autograph to the 200 I already had in my 1974 program).

The signing ran from 1:30 to 3:00 I arrived at 1:15 and as one might expect many had arrived earlier. As the line advance, soon there were over 60 people behind me. After over an hour we were herded onto an extremely large elevator and taken up to the floor for the signing. 

What followed was truly unfortunate!

We we’re told to stay in the elevator, which then returned to the ground floor. We were then informed that Alex was spending longer with each fan than expected and we would not be able to meet him as promised, as he had a prior engagement scheduled immediately after 3pm. Our tickets were taken from us with multiple apologizes, and the promise of a refund or a book as soon as they could arrange it.

While disappointed, at my age you understand that these things happen. 

As you might expect it wasn’t the book that I was looking forward to, nor was it obtaining Alex’s autograph. What has always meant the most to me is that brief encounter with those who’s imagination and talents, entertain, awe, and inspire us, that is what I treasure. It matters not whether it is a name we all know or someone who has just published their first comic book.

Imagine how it felt afterwards to discover from the people at Alex Ross Art that ReedPop had turned away those last 60 fans without first informing Alex! Once Alex knew, his team tried to find those who might still be in the area, but sadly nearly all of us had dispersed.

Then to add insult to injury what followed over the next 3 months we’re multiple emails in which I requested a refund that month after month never came. Penguin-Random House had attempted to arrange the refund but since ReedPop had collected the $66.00, it had to come from them. My requests achieved nothing, my follow ups went nowhere, and even threats were simply ignored. Not once did ReedPop send me an email update or respond to my inquires.

Then something rather unique happened. I had copied Eli at Alex Ross Art on some of the emails, and unbeknown to me they to had been working behind the scenes since the beginning of January to try and get ReedPop to fix this. They too had gotten nowhere with the multi billion dollar corporation. However, they were determined that this treatment was not acceptable, and asked me to send them a copy of my online ticket/receipt for the event to aid in pursuing the issue. They even promised to refund me what I had paid even though they never received a single penny of it. I provided them with the requested evidence and they once again went to bat for the little guy!

This Monday ReedPop at long last contacted me stating that they had figured out why I hadn’t received the refund and it had now been processed. Then yesterday a package arrived via UPS from the people at Alex Ross Art, it was a literal “Swap Bag” of goodies containing over a dozen items including 3 signed prints.

I have wonderful stories of those I’ve met over the 45 years that I’ve been carrying around that program from 1974. Of how, Moebius actually wrote a tiny greeting to his friend Sergio Aragonés back in 93 that Sergio then read 22 years later at SDCC. Of winning a futuristic prop used in the TV series “The Expanse” while meeting James S.A. Corey (Yeah, both of them). How Janet Lee and I have become friends when we discovered we both create hand made Christmas Tree ornaments each year. These are but a few of the many.

Though I never got to meet him, of all the stories I have, how Alex Ross and his people stepped in for the little 6o year old guy is certainly finest, and I wanted to share it with you all.

50,"When Bendis first announced he was coming to DC I was honestly incredibly apprehensive. I hadn't been reading much Marvel at the time, but I had heard some of his recent output wasn't great. That said, this was the man who wrote Ultimate Spider-Man so I decided to remain cautiously optimistic.

I am so happy i was totally wrong. Bendis' books at DC are not only my favorites running right now, but some of the best comics to come out of DC in recent times. As a Superman fan, his Superman run is basically just a dream come true. Both of them just kick total ass in every way. Action is bringing that really strong street level feel Bendis is known for to the Daily Planet, and I love the idea of the Invisible Mafia. Superman is definitely not as strong as Action on a technical level, but I think I prefer it just because of how much cool cosmic crap Bendis is bringing in. I adore how well he's connecting DC Cosmic together, and with what hes been teasing I'm even more excited for where its going. Rogol Zaar has a terrible Jim Lee design, but his backstory is incredibly compelling. 

Young Justice just launched but that first issue was such a massive celebration of everything DC. With this book spearheading the Wonder Comics imprint, this has the potential to be a fantastic platform for diverse characters ala what Marvel is doing with Champions and the surrounding minis and ongoings. 

The big thing though for me is, these books are really making me feel excited and passionate about DC in way I havent really been feeling for a while. Its been a major surprise to me but Bendis has become a major voice at DC and hes really revitalized that spirit. I'm even more hopeful that the people he's bringing with him like Kelly Sue DeConnick are going to have similar success.",Atmageth,Can we talk about Bendis?,1547829240,37,True,comicbooks,2019-01-18

121,"It's interesting to note how the two versions of batman widely considered to be the best( Nolan!  And Miller!) seem to be political antithesis to each other

Miller's Batman, for example,  is motivated by rage and anger,  combined with a strong sense of punishing the wrong. He's the epitome of Vigilante justice. 

He sees the world going to shit,  he sees the system fucking up and he wants to BEAT THOSE FUCKERS UP.

In contrast,  Nolan's Batman seems to be doing it more from moral obligation than anything. There's  a focus that he's thinking his motivations out,  that it's not out of emotional sense of right and wrong. In fact that method is explicitly condemned in this version,  where Rachel slaps Bruce for planning to shoot Joe Chill after his trial failed. 

This Batman believes in making a working system, most seen when he sees Harvey's change as more legitimate change compared to his vigilante justice.

This difference is most exemplified when looking at what happens when Batman leaves his vigilante ways for years

The government has failed, and Batman has to lead a resurgence in Gotham to establish peace and separate it from the rest of the country, and then face Superman,  whose become a crony of the government.

The government has succeeded, even if through dishonest means Batman personally aided in. Batman has to defeat Bane, who leads a resurgence in Gotham that separates it from the rest of the country. 

Hell, N!Batman actually ends up serving the same role Superman typically does in his stories, as a role model and symbol for the regular citizens to emulate

There's a feeling that if the two met they would see each other as the villains of their own stories,(M! as bane,  N! as superman) 

So I was wondering, has this happened to other superheroes, where there are two versions almost opposite to each other?  What are the politics of other batmen? My batman experience is kind of limited,  so here are the ones I personally experienced.

Zack Snyder!Batman where he is something something cool fight scene. I don't know. Right wing-ish?

156,"Hi everyone! :)

I was browsing reddit while on break and I noticed some comments on Cates's Venom that made me think.

Let me start by saying that I enjoy both the new Venom run and the New 52 Batman series, even though I find the latter a bit inconsistent in places.

That said I was thinking of the similarities between the two runs and I am wondering if they are coincidences or not.

The first thing we can notice is that both writers aim for gritty and dark stories, with grandiose villains that threaten whole cities with unconventional means. Both Knull and the Court of Owls are new creations and retcon part of the character's origin story. Cates is also bringing back Carnage (Venom's nemesis) just like Snyder brought back the Joker (Bruce's nemesis) in his second story arc.

The main character is a deeply troubled anti-hero who usually ends up winning at a high personal price. Father figures have had quite a deep impact on the protagonists' psyche.

This is something of a subjective opinion, but both writers' endings appear a bit rushed after the bombastic buildups that preceded them (for example Venom #6 was slightly underwhelming for me even if I enjoyed it all the same).

Both writers are perfectly complemented by artists that show a big Todd McFarlane influence (Capullo even worked on Spawn) and seem to be inspired themselves by the 90s as far as the [badass elements](https://cdn.comicsverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/VENOM4.jpg) in their stories are concerned. For example, I haven't read Dark Nights: Metal but from what I've heard it's very 90s-influenced, plus you can't deny that the dragon symbiote is pretty much something you could find in a lost early-Image comic book.

Another thing I've started to notice recently is that, while at the beginning Cates's Venom seemed to be universally loved, it's starting to get its fair share of detractors both on twitter and here on reddit. The same could be said of Snyder's Batman, which started very strong with the Court of Owls and then started to get a somewhat mixed reception in the subsequent story arcs.

I could probably find other things in common but I am wondering if it's all just a reach on my part or if you agree/disagree and why. I suppose some of these elements are common for a lot of comic books but I can't help but connect the two runs everytime I see some new pages.

231,"This is my opinion. 

I want the old Helena Bertinelli back. This the perfect time to bring her back because Birds of Prey rebirth kind off flopped and while Helena was the not the sole reason for this(there were many reasons that I could list in another thread) I don’t see where to go with the current version, she is not the best character. Compared to  all the development the old version has, it’s a no brainer. 

Pre-New52 Helena. She was friends with Tim Drake. She butted heads with Batman as he kicked her out the JL and Barbara. She later becomes friends with Barbara and Batman warms to her during Birds of Prey. She has always been on the outskirts of the Batfamily; she was involved in Batman: No man’s land and Batman: Hush, always trying to get in closer. To be accepted by them. 

Now I always found this interesting because the original Helena, Helena Wayne, was Batman and catwoman’s daughter. So while the Bertinelli version had a different story she was always connected to Batman and involved in his stories. This always felt right to me. 

They are different characters, the two Helena’s. Not only do they look different their history is different. Their connections are different. Their stories are different. 

Yes she is white but that’s not a problem. Yes it’s important to have dark skinned characters for representation because white people aren’t the only ones who read and support comics but its not important to do it this way and replace an existing character with loads of development. It’s not the way to do it. If the only reason not to bring her back is because she is white I think that’s wrong. I don’t want to get rid of the new Helena but they can make her into her own character, she has a whole history with spyral. I have thought about this way too much but I have interesting ideas. 

And if it doesn’t happen, ok I guess I just continue reading some old stories.

Just finished it a few ago, and man was I a bit disappointed. It started off strong with the amazing bar fight scene. (And then loosing his van shortly after. RIP Punisher Van :( ) After that things started to feel pretty weak.

 There was a good 3(?) Episodes in the middle where there was a place of unnecessary filling and frankly not much action from Frank or Jigsaw.

Karen Paige showing up for 20 minutes.

A lot of Doctor drama that I personally thought was used as too much filler.

To me, it felt like Netflix really just wanted to churn the rest of this out ASAP. Going to be surprised if it takes longer than a month for Netflix to announce the cancellation.

On the other side, Bernthal was amazing. The action scenes that did happen were great (top 2 being the bar and Jigsaw's warehouse). Ended on a good, non-cliffhanger episode.

264,"For me, I'd have these two alternate continuities:

----

##The Flash

*The Flash* is female, her name is Serafina Kalinowska - name generated by FakeNameGenerator.com [ (or ""Rafi"" for short, the other well-known Raffy is from [Home and Away](https://homeandaway.fandom.com/wiki/Raffy_Morrison) and her look is modelled on [Jes Macallan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2860033/), who incidentally enough, is currently on a DC television series airing now - *Legends of Tomorrow*.

Her story arc would be taking on metahumans much like the canon Barry Allen does, but not necessarily speedsters. New villains such as:

**Owlman** [ (no, not *the* alternate universe Batman called Owlman) ] - A metahuman who has the power to control bird life to bend to his will, originally a handler of wild birds and falcon.

**Lady Manhattan** - No relation to Dr. Manhattan, this Manhattan socialite has the power to control technology and is a relative of a billionaire whose firm produces high-end technology [sort of like Elon Musk mixed with Bruce Wayne]. This metahuman gained super-strength, and other abilities [yet to be determined].

The story arc would be about Rafi taking on the metahumans, and also facing another crisis - Barry Allen from Earth-One ends up trapped on her Earth as well.

---------

##Stargirl [unnamed]

This iteration of Stargirl remains Courtney Whitmore, but is aged up to being an adult like Barry Allen in *The Flash*.

Here, she *isn't* in the Justice League of America, instead residing in a city that's not quite Starling City or National City, instead it being a different city. 

She has to deal with a crisis involving Barry Allen [*The Flash*], Supergirl and another character [not decided] as a crisis crossover.

The setting, style and tone are similar to *The Flash* [2014 TV series], although it is its own distinct continuity, and not a straight adaptation.

------------

For both, I took inspiration from *Elseworlds*, as these are technically elseworlds, unless you consider them as alternate universes.

282,"‘Once Upon a Deadpool’ was not perfect by any means, but it was way better than it should of been and it has me more excited for the future of Marvel and Deadpool now. It also made the flaws of Deadpool 2 more evident.

Let me start this off by saying Deadpool 2 is my favorite of the 3 Deadpool movies (4 if you include the super duper cut). The reason why Deadpool 2 is my favorite is because it was the most comic-accurate Deadpool in terms of Wade Wilson being human. He had real emotion and it was great. The other reason is that Deadpool 1 seemed like it was strictly for shock value while making deadpool more like the internets version of Deadpool. It was still a good film that was funny but it wasn’t “my” Deadpool and that's ok. I don’t expect them to make a character identical to the comics, since characters change and evolve with time. Plus movies and humor are subjective.

When I heard Deadpool 2 would have a PG-13 version, I was intrigued but scared. I mean, how can they remove the violence, language and jokes? Well after watching ‘Once Upon a Deadpool’ (twice) I am really surprised with how much of the movie still worked.

Let's look at the bad of it first though. They seriously dropped the ball with the beginning of the movie. The beginning was so choppy. They removed my favorite actions scenes, they removed the blood, they omitted the Logan joke and the cocaine joke (which they totally could of pushed for). These are problems that could've been handled better. The problem is they couldn’t reshoot the stuff and they didn’t plan the fight scenes around a PG-13. The rating wasn’t the main issue, it was the fact they had to work with pre-shot footage. They also played it VERY safe. PG-13 movies can have blood. Like a lot more than they showed. They also removed jokes that were totally ok like the mcrib joke and the prison wallet sound fx.

Let's get to why I loved the movie despite those flaws. Deadpool acted and talked more like Deadpool from the comics. He was more meta and his jokes weren’t reliant on swearing to be funny. He was more absurd and creative with his expletives. The bleeping was clever as hell and acted just like the swearing symbols in the comics. Some of the redone jokes were actually better in some cases too (though that is subjective) Overall it just felt more like Deadpool from the actual comics. This also made me so happy, since it means that Deadpool isn’t about a rating, but it's the character and the jokes. So many of the jokes in the original used profanity as a crutch. This is the flaw I never noticed with Deadpool 2. Seriously I never realized how much of Deadpool 1 and 2 were just sex jokes said differently with random nouns. There are times where I laughed even though it wasn’t funny or well written, but because he dropped some f-bombs. The problem with that is they wear off after and lose their impact after over-use. Once upon a Deadpool got creative with the censorship, which in itself if more clever than just crude humor.

If they announced a PG-13 Deadpool movie now, I don’t think I would be too upset. I think they would have much more blood and violence than ‘Once Upon a Deadpool’ offered. It also wouldn’t be a disjointed film since they could film around the restrictions. They can take the restrictions and use them as a way to get more clever jokes. In fact, the jokes would have to rely on clever writing instead of the shock-value the movies seem to rely on. To be honest the movie got me hyped since there is a very real chance that Deadpool can appear in mainstream Marvel movies and the movie shows that he can work very well in a PG-13. Spiderpool can actually happen now.

Sorry for my writing style and thanks for reading!

I'm new to reddit so first of all, cheers !

&amp;#x200B;

Lately i've been starting to get interested in comic books.

A friend landed me so Ed Brubaker stuff, so i've read ""Kill or be killed"", than ""Femme Fatal"" and ""The Scene of the Crime"".

They all were fine, i liked kill or be killed the most because it felt very, authentic, raw and brutal - or in one word - edgy.

But I felt something is missing...like i'm trying to find something even darker and...""smarter"", something which will make think, like a good Sherlock Holmes book would, but darker with more edge it.

So he landed me V for Vendetta which is the 4th and currently the best of them all.

The artistic writing, the edginess and the dark atmosphere, along the realism and a  very wit story telling - really did something.

And my mind just blew.
I have watched the CW series and i know he can phase so can't he just phase through any enemies heart and kill them and they cant even counter him cuz he is fast as fuck boi..Imagine the mass of the punch he will throw that would kill anyone with one blow.Your mass becomes infinite when you travel as fast as light (theoretically) and lets assume in the comic they can define infinite then his punches have a mass of tredecillion times of infinite.That makes him super OP but then why is he a second tier hero? or is it because he is not BATMAN?

332,"the Green Lanterns, specifically Hal, John, Guy and Kyle. These four men each fill in the same role (often at the same time), yet have completely different personalities that make them more than just another Action Hero.

Hal Jordan is often cited as generic, and many detractors/neutrals on the character say that he's just a generic Silver Age Character. Allow me to defend Hal for a moment here, because I've always seen that notion as a bit unfair. Hal is often praised by modern writers as ""THE Green Lantern; The Best of the Corps"" and that's never made much sense to me because of how Hal's character ticks. Hal is not a leader, nor is he a follower; he's a lone agent, a fearless, loyal thrill-seeker with arguably self-destructive, reckless behaviour stemming from childhood scars but an ethical code equal to Superman...even though he's slightly more willing to kill than Big Blue, even if he doesn't like it. Outside of his heroics, he's an Air Force Test Pilot; a job that lets him literally ""fly solo"" on thrilling flights, detached from the rest of the world akin to how his role as a Lantern has detached him from the rest of the Earth more and more over the years.

John Stewart is very different. He's an ex-marine (a sniper, to be precise) and a former archaeologist; both roles require focus, seriousness, efficiency and precision, all things John has in spades. Like Hal, he's detached from the Earth, though John is far more detached than Hal will ever be, as Hal will always going back for Carol while John, who has a confessed preference for alien women, seems to go more ""exotic"" with time. He's orderly, organised and sharp-minded, with a mind for philosophy and ethical debates. He prefers efficiency to flashy substance, hence his frequently mundane usage of the Ring; he'd rather take someone down quickly and efficiently over a big light show. Out of these four, John is the one most suited to lead the Lanterns by far. Hal's great at solo missions, Guy's great in all-out brawls and Kyle's great at being a Wild Card One-Man Army, but none of them have John's ability to lead.

Guy Gardner...is complicated. Most people look at him and just see the man who got hit by a bus and got One-Punched by Batman, and as such dismiss him as ""The Dumb Brute One"", which is sad because Guy had a fascinating history beyond being a bruiser. He had two main jobs before becoming a Lantern; a Social Welfare Caseworker and a Teacher of Disabled Children. Yeah, that's right. Guy Gardner, the Lantern whose often characterised as an oafish, idiotic loser who only cares about himself and whose face his fist is going to connect to next, dedicated his life to caring for children and inmates going through rehabilitation. This alone makes Guy a fascinating character, a man with such outward aggression yet seems to be one of the most caring characters we've covered so far, but we're not done yet. You see, the reason Guy quit the casework job was because his aggression from his teenage years was beginning to seep out of him. His teenage self was a delinquent whose behaviour stemmed from a particularly horrible childhood of abuse, neglect and failed attempts to get positive attention from his father that he only coped with through his love of comic books (General Glory stories, to be precise). A lot of people (including DC, if the New 52 historical rewrite means anything) choose to ignore a lot of this as ""Early Instalment Weirdness""  but I choose to use all this information as a basis for why Guy does what he does. At the end of the day, he's a bitter, cynical jerk with anger issues that doesn't trust authority figures and loves beating people up, but he's also imaginative, loyal, devoted to helping the less fortunate, willing to fight to his last breath to save the universe, and has a fascinating tendency to see the best in people...even if he frequently gets envious of those truly noble qualities. He's a truly flawed hero, and while he's actually my least favourite Lantern (because of how often he's just shown as a dick with none of the pathos that makes him interesting beyond that), I have to respect him for that.

Kyle Rayner is weird, out of place and shouldn't work as a Lantern. Not as a character in a piece of fiction of course, if anything his creative nature makes him perfect as a user for a multi-tool like the Green Lantern Ring. No, In-Universe Kyle makes absolutely no sense as a member of a Police Force operation like the Green Lantern Corps. He's like one of those young kids who were mandated to go to war during WWI; obviously not suited for it, but the circumstances forced him to. However, all things considered he made the best of the situation. The reason why I described him as ""The Wild Card One-Man Army"" earlier was because Kyle's mind is that of a very good artist; creative, unique and weird. This kid has the most destructive potential out of any GL ever due to the power of his mind. Hal's the best solo-act, John's the best leader and Guy's the best throw-down fighter, but Kyle could easily take out all of them by simply letting his imagination run loose. This kid even made Batman freak out once with his dangerous potential. He's a dork, but an immensely powerful, creative dork, and that's what makes him an effective Lantern.

335,"So I just read ""Hulk: Return of the Monster"" and I am blown away. I just recently started reading Marvel comics (mostly Hulk, X-Men and Avengers) and I'm loving them.

What are the best Hulk and/or Avengers comic books that have been published in the last 20ish years? I'm not really too big on the older stuff (pre-90s comics) and I don't like watching cartoons.

I'm 26 years old, I didn't really like any of the Marvel movies other than the latest Avengers since they actually wrote a cool story. Here is what I plan on reading in the next few months as far as Hulk goes:

1. Hulk: Gray
2. The Definitive Hulk
3. Incredible Hulks: Heart of the Monster
4. Hulk - Volume 1: Red Hulk
5. Hulk: The End

Please give me suggestions on which comic books from the Avengers series I should read next. I don't know too many characters from the Marvel universe so I'd rather not stray away from the original characters. However, I do like learning about the universes and I even skimmed through an edition of an alternate universe episode and it seemed pretty cool.

336,"#@$&amp; yes! This is the Punisher. It's so good; seriously so good so far, but they are hitting the 90s a little too hard. It seems to be by design from the trailer soundtrack to Frank's haircut. It's forgivable because the action is on point. Episode 3 is going to be a go to watch for me I think, it's like reading an old war journal.

Jigsaw should have been left out if they were just going to turn him into some kind of Casey Jones/Joker knock off though. Pay a make up fx guy, he's got like two cuts on his face ffs. seriously the Casey Jones from tmnt mask is weak as hell. They need a bad guy, I get it. And it's a nice plot device to tie in Homeland security or whatever, but if you want jigsaw for season two, lock Frank up and do the jigsaw story justice. 

I'm nit picking because this is easily my favorite current TV show by a country mile. I mean I m all in. I want that van as my daily driver it's that good. When they show the cuffs clamped to the desk and he's gone, then the bad guys start dropping like flies I felt like clapping out loud. The incompetent country cops were over the top, but that one line about a guy coming to town who turns out to be death it the devil made up for it in folds. It made me want to make this post in fact.

I love it so far and hope to get two or three more episodes in before my kids wake up. I'm binging this $#&amp;£ bitches.",egus,"Punisher: Netflix season two, episodes 1-3, thoughts from a fan from the 90s (spoiler maybe?)",1548070497,21,True,comicbooks,2019-01-21

Personally, I think crossovers with similar heroes are kind of boring, and would rather see some more oddball pairings.

* **Squirrel Girl / Batman** \- SG is always best when she has a straight-man to play off of, and there's no better straight man than Batman
* **Ms Marvel and the Legion of Super-heroes** \- In the tradition of teen heroes from DC joining up with the Legion, it would be awesome for one of Marvel's most popular teen heroes to join up with them. 
* **Doom Patrol / Deadpool** \- Deadpool hanging out with heroes with deformities/disabilities makes way more sense than him hanging with the X-Men.  Plus Deadpool visiting Danny the Street pretty much writes itself.
* **Wonder Woman / X-Men** \- Wonder Woman's mission of peace intersecting with the X-Men's missing of tolerance and acceptance would parallel much of the current political climate

411,"So after hearing this series reccomended so often on here I decided to buy the two omnibuses on Comixology for $12 dollars and honestly I'm glad I bought it on sale. I didn't hate it, in fact I honestly read the whole series in about eight hours over three days. 

My issue with the series and the reason I'm glad I got it on sale instead of paying full price has to do more with the last few chapters. After Elijah enacts his plan to kill the rest of the Four I felt like the series just lost all of its momentum. 

The last issue where they rescue Ambrose just seemed sort of pointless and it felt like a non-ending. Honestly, the whole series seemed more like loosely connected vignettes where Ellis just wanted to show off a cool concepts. 

I mean I realize everything came together in the end but I can't imagine reading this series monthly and having it make any sense at all.  I guess my main problem with the series is that it never felt like there was any real sense of stakes going on. Elijah, Jakita and Drums all felt hyper-condfident and for as supposedly sinister as the four were supposed to be they didn't really seem present in the story or much of a threat to begin with. They were dispatched so easily. 

I don't know; long story short I enjoyed the series but I honestly don't get the hype surrounding it and I feel like Black Science by Remender handled the multiversal aspect better. The main characters were likable but not really relatable. ",Chronos96,[Discussion] Just finished Warren Ellis's Planetary. What are your thoughts?

2. Is it specific to different series'?

Now, where were we...

Ah yes, the ol ""let's wait for the big corporations to change their model of business out of the kindness of their own hearts"" recurring discussion. Real talk, for all their speeches of supporting the Direct Market, DC and MArvel's number #1 priority is themselves. AND YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR IT!
THEY ARE BUSINESSES!

Look at DC. It went from a company that was super communicative with retailers and incredibly supporting to one that decided to give a Tom King and Andy Kubert story to Wallmart. I dunno, maybe they got big money for that. Maybe Mr. Wall Mart really loves comics and wanted some exclusives. But they literally cut out their number 1 partner, retailers in the direct market out of something that we could sell since our customers actually know these creators. It was puzzling, but just another show of how comic book stores are seen by the corporations. But hey, we'll still be here to welcome them back with open arms if this thing fails. Because retailers are suckers for punishment.

You know when everyone talks about how comics are doomed and publishers are the devil blah blah... You know who the retailers online aren't blaming? Retailers. You know whose fault it is that we have 750 million variants per month? Retailers, because they're the ones that buy them in the first place.

Marvel isn't to blame that there are 1 in 500 variants. Retailers are, because years of their practices and speculation lead to this. Retailers that spent their lives only selling DC and Marvel and not building a diverse customer base are in danger now. Because this is a different market. And some are having a really hard time with it. The entire situation the industry is living now? There isn't one single culprit. It's all of us. 

The Direct Market (remember, we're talking single issues here) is a delicate ecosystem. And we've been in the middle of our very own Climate Change for a good while.

So what can we do improve things?

The Direct Market NEEDS returnability. We won't be able to raise our orders and try to get more customers in stores in the current climate when we are being asked to take on all the responsibility.

Retailers are expected to buy all these comics from publishers  (buy them outright, you don't get to return what you don't sell), and then do the marketing  ourselves and sell them to customers.
And hopefully we'll turn a profit.

THIS IS UNSUSTAINABLE!

You're not even marketing your own books, comic companies! An ad for NIGHTWING on BATMAN isn't marketing! You're talking to the same audience! How is it that these massive mega companies can't market anything to save their lives?!

Retailers have to shoulder all of these different expenses of the business so the publishers can make as much money as possible and we don't even get treated as real business partners.

We are constantly asked to buy (not order, BUY) books without knowing what happens in them or sometimes who the creative team even is. That... that doesn't work like that anywhere else.

I mean, I love Chip and totally get why he wants to keep people in suspense re: DAREDEVIL #1 but I'm not people. I'm a business partner and Marvel should have not kept me in the dark. It's business.

Creators should be free to create and not have to worry about marketing when they're working for a corporation. Corporations have people that do just that, marketing. Put them to use.

Example: I love the creators in the upcoming AGE OF X-MAN stuff. All brilliant, talented people. Pre-orders on that are nearly zero because no one knows really what is. Because ""marketing"" for this is ""let's put something on Newsarama and call it a day""

Those creators are fighting an uphill battle, and they seem to have almost no support from the publisher. What's the point of releasing a book you don't believe in 100%? Do you want to sell it or not?

The companies don't care. Because they know they'll sell enough copies to make it or at least not lose money and that's enough. Why spend money on marketing and potentially get new customers if you're happy with milking the usual people for more?

You know why you are seeing all these announcements of new series selling out in the first 5 minutes? Of #2s selling out even before coming out? Because publishers aren't overprinting. They rather not take that risk. They rather YOU the customer wait weeks for a second printing (potentially never coming back for it...). Retailers aren't ordering as many comics as before, so publishers print these things as close to the bone. Then they can joyfully announce that they sold out in record time, gee whizz.

If you have orders of 10 for an #1 and you print 10.5, because you rather get the (sigh) marketing bump of THIS WAS SO HOT THAT IT'S ALREADY GOING INTO SECOND PTG BEFORE COMIGN OUT... you're not helping retailers or more important the customers!

If you're putting out weekly series with no returnability and where retailers are buying 5 or 10 issues sight unseen... You're not helping. Retailers are here to sell as many comics as possible, but it's incredible how our business partners make it so hard. It really shouldn't be this way. It doesn't have to be this way.

RETAILERS:
Join ComicsPro. We have a louder voice when we talk as one!
No one is going to help us, we have to help ourselves.

CUSTOMERS:
Keep being wonderful and spending money in your favourite comics book stores! Word of warning, though, more and more stores are cutting orders as much as possible and if you're not there on Wednesday or have a pull list, you might miss out.

We've seen a big increase in orders since we started using ComicHub. Customers are definitely getting savvier about ordering comics, and now we have even LESS stuff going on the shelves. If your local shop has it, open an account on ComicHub to manage your orders.

If they don't it's grand! Start a pull list. Tell the folks at the counter what stuff you're into and what you want to buy, all that helps. Again, almost all the stores we know are trimming orders as much as possible, don't miss out!

Publishers: 
Some of you are already amazing and we love, you so much. The other ones, let's see how we can work together more. We can sell more comics TOGETHER. 

Let's get into 2019 and work it out, ok?

&amp;#x200B;

So the rules/events are as follows (they're more guidelines than anything.. The point is to have fun): 

1. A portal opens beneath you and you fall through. You can't prepare for it. You go now with the knowledge you currently posses and with whatever you have on you.
2. You're sent to either Marvel or DC comics, whichever is your preference  (if you want a challenge, you can pick the one you know the least of.)
3. You find yourself somewhere on their earth (let's say somewhere populated in a country where you speak the language to not make the challenge about language barriers.)
4. You don't know at which point in time you end up. If you arrive in the 80's is the 80's comics canon that counts, if you end up in 2019 it's the current canon that counts. (So you'll probably be able to find a Batman in DC comics, but you can't be sure that every character you know exists where you end up, unless they've existed for most of the publishers history.)
5. You do not gain superpowers/mutations/etc. on arrival, but knock yourself out with whatever weird science-gone-wrong stuff you find there.
6. You can't stay (some of you probably would, but I'm interested in hearing how you'd get back here)

And to reiterate the questions:

1. How do figure out when and where you are based on your knowledge of the universe and its events?
2. What do you do with your knowledge or their world? Do you warn of major event, do you try to pass on as much as you can, are you cautious not to affect their timeline or something else entirely?
3. How do you get home?

16,"“The Immortal Hulk” is one of the most popular renditions of Hulk in spite of it **arguably** being outside of the Hulk’s natural genre. That got me thinking about the concept of “superheroes having genres” in general.

In his Spider-Man’s third appearance, he fights a group that was heavily implied to be alien invaders. The villain that was considered to be Iron Man’s archenemy, Mandarin, was clearly magic-based. Both of these examples were retconned to being within their respective heroes genres.

Older comics were much more liberal with the problems that heroes faced. **Super**heroes solved **super** problems, regardless of their specific “type”.

My curiosity comes from a common criticism that superheroes face about acting “outside” their general genre.

51,"Hey y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

Hope y'all have a good holiday season, so recently I was going through Amazon and was looking to purchase some comics of the Green Hornet. Then I was reading some of the reviews and one in particular really caught my eye. The reviewer stated that his take on the Green Hornet was ""the last good thing he wrote before the decline"". So it did get me thinking, has he really gotten bad?

&amp;#x200B;

I remember people loving Mark Waid for his seminal run on Daredevil, mainly because he stopped making his life depressing and made him a swash-buckling hero. People were sadden by his departure at DC because he wrote classic stories such as Superman: Birthright and Kingdom Come, plus his amazing run on The Flash to boot (no pun intended). I'll admit, I haven't read any recent Mark Waid books in a long time. Not because I've lost interest, but more I haven't really had time for it. I remember he was one of many writers that got me into comic books. Captain America: Rebirth was one of the books that really got me into comics and I have Mark Waid to thank for it. Superman: Birthright was a great reintroduction for me to get back into comics when I thought they were getting stale AND I have Mark Waid to thank for it.

&amp;#x200B;

So now returning to the topic at hand, I'll also admit when I read some of his material on the Archie Reboot... and I didn't like. But I admit that it's more because I'm not a big fan of ""slice-of-life"" stories with a few exception here and there. I also noticed a Youtuber made a video that it was Mark Waid's fault on why Marvel comics started to become more political with their stories and pushing towards the SJW crowd (personally I disagree with the video but that's just me).

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is when was the decline of Mark Waid? Why did this start to happen? And do YOU believe Mark Waid has declined in quality? And if you're reading this, I hope you have yourself and amazing day and a happy holiday!",ShinbrigGoku,Did Mark Waid go bad?? (Discussion),1545236181,38,True,comicbooks,2018-12-19

63,"I was pretty skeptical going into it. I didn't know how venerated BKV is in comics and wasn't too thrilled by the concept of a superhero turned politician. But I liked Y: The Last Man, so I figured I'd give this a try. 

This is a wholly unique look at superheroes. It provides a more grounded look on the genre, while not sacrificing the more out there aspects. One arc could focus on political issues and the idea of vigilantism while the next is a big mystery arc on the hunt for a murderer and the next could leave you thinking about alternate universes, time travel, or aliens. i was consistently impresses by Vaughan's ability to keep the story fresh with a myriad of situations to put Hundred in. 

Hundred himself was a great, believable character. He's just the kind of guy you'd expect to become a superhero given his situation. I love how they made him a comic book reader without making him a weird nerd stereotype. He's an actual person with layers, superhero, comic fan, and politician. The supporting cast, Bradbury and Wylie especially, play off of Hundred perfectly and are interesting in their own right. 

The main conflict of the story, the mystery of Hundred's powers and the supernatural occurrences that happen around him, had me interested from start to finish. The ending was both the surreal, terrifying, and ultimately satisfying. 

Other than that, I found BKV appearance in one of the issues absolutely hilarious. I would've like to see more of Hundred's exploits as The Great Machine. I wish Bradbury hadn't gotten such a raw deal in the end. ",Speedwizard106,What did you think of Brian K. Vaughan's Ex Machina?,1545243787,11,True,comicbooks,2018-12-19

I saw Into the spiderverse yesterday and was absolutely blown away by, what I believe to be, the best Marvel movie to date. I'm watching videos about Marvel and DC comics for around 2 years now and here and there also read a few comics so I'd say that I know my way around the topic as a whole, but I'd really enjoy getting into Spiderman more specific.   


I'm definitely going to read the Ultimate Spiderman run, but right now I'd like to start with the original. I've already heard that Big Time or Brand New Day would be great events to start with, but I feel like I'd be missing out on a lot. I'd like to know from a few Spidey fans what essential stories there are. For example, I'd really like to read Gwens death (which I believe is in a quite old run of the char) and where octavius takes over peters body (superior Spiderman I believe?).  
So my question now is: What events are essential/the best, where should I begin reading without interruption and does it make sense to read EVERYTHING (which I think could be a damn lot to catch up) or should I skip stuff?

129,"So, growing up, my parents never really allowed me to read any comic books because they said that the pictures would rot my brain and that it wasn't as beneficial to me as books. At the time I was young so I just kinda went along with it because I thought they knew what was best for me.

Now that I'm a teenager, I've seen a lot of comic book inspired media like shows and movies, and started reading comics without my parents knowing because I knew they would oppose it. I usually go to the library to read them and finish a book or two before leaving. But one day I was reading this really long book and I didn't want to leave the story halfway so I decided to just borrow it and see what my parents would say, I mean I was a teenager by now surely they would be more cool with it. Apparently not. They spent like an hour telling me that reading comics was the reason my English was getting worse. Which makes no sense considering I got top in my class for the recent exams. I told them that and they just told me being top in class doesn't mean that my English is good and they asked me to return the book the next day.

After that, I resorted to reading the comics that I wanted online. Because I didn't have a credit card yet I couldn't pay for any of the available services and that makes me feel bad because I want to support the industry and because I love reading comics. After a while I figured out I could pay my friend and then use his credit card to buy the online version of the books. While that does work, I really want to physically have some of the comics, because I like them a lot, and want to display them proudly in my room, but I know my parents would surely disaprove of it and maybe even ask me to throw them away.

Are most parents like this or just mine? Has anyone else encountered a similar problem? What are some ways you can think of to convince parents that comic books aren't harmful towards children?

178,"The new Green Lantern run is really good with a lot to dig into, but there's been one recurring comment that pops up, which I wanted to discuss. The notion of Morrison 'ignoring continuity' for his run, which, considering his great body of work, seems quite an odd criticism to me. The bulk of it emerges from Morrison not following up the 2-page epilogue to Hal n Pals which feature Carol and Hal embracing, but there's an issue there. Morrison wrote his scripts way ahead of time and is currently working on #11 (the issue meant to come out September of 2019, which is crazy ahead of time for a monthly book), so what he wrote came in way ahead of time and was all done and set in stone before Hal n Pals' epilogue was ever even done.

Beyond that, Venditti himself is the writer that tore down the Carol/Hal relationship more than anyone else. Johns spent a great deal of time and effort bringing them together again and writing their dynamics and relationship wherever he could over the course of his 9-year tenure. Then Venditti tore it all down in his very first issue, after the beautiful Green Lantern #20 conclusion, with not even a second's hesitation. The justification given at the time for this was also, quite frankly, ridiculous. I'll quote it here for the sake of context.

&gt;N: So what are your feelings about Carol Ferris? In your first issue, you had Hal and Carol break up again. Is her relationship with Hal something you just see as being played out, or do you have plans for her?

&gt;RV: I think Carol is an amazing character, I love her, and I feel like what happened between her and Hal (Carol dumps him) in issue #21, **is just something that I feel like a woman who is as strong and commanding as her would do**. And just because her and Hal are on the outs at the present moment doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have a key role to play in all of the Green Lantern titles, and not just to Hal and the main Green Lantern book specifically.

Now having done this, his tenure also saw the fairly awful issue where Carol, who's still with Kyle, tells Hal that maybe they'll be together again, which is pretty not great, to say the least. Venditti not only ripped apart the work Johns did and tore down the relationship, but over the 85+ issues of GL he wrote, majority of, if not all, Carol moments revolve around or are tied to how Carol no longer loves Hal and does not wish to be with him. You can't break something that was earned over the course of years of storytelling like that, ignore it and then pretend it's all fine again in a 2-page epilogue. What about Carol? Where is she right now, emotionally? How does she feel? We're not given any of this as Carol's thrown aside and never really used, especially during the course of the Hal n Pals era. We get Soranik's poor turn, random new OC characters like Sarko get full arcs, but Carol gets nothing. What happened can't be 'fixed' via a 'I broke the toys, here they're kinda how I found them' 2 pager. You have to work for it, you have to build what was broken again. You have to put in the work. You have to earn it. It's why the criticism baffles me, since Venditti never did that work, he just utilized a fan service moment to mark the end of his era. They're not even together again, they see each other, embrace, kiss and that's it. That's not a relationship or them dating again. (This is all putting aside all the other various instances of throwing out continuity in his tenure, from blowing up everything in the Sinestro run, the true successor to Johns' GL, both figuratively and literally to regressing of Sinestro and more.)

Morrison read Venditti's stuff early on (which is how he came up with The Blackstars), as he re-read every issue of Green Lantern and all of Hal's stories, alongside every sci-fi DC collection he could get his hands on, to build his GL run. His run has had interns going through tons of old comics to get information on old, long lost characters and concepts. The guy is the champion of 'everything is canon' and is the guy that wrote Batman and Multiversity, the guy who used *Electric Blue Superman* in Rock of Ages, he's not the one to ignore continuity. His run picks up on a facet of Hal that even Johns' run stated quite [blatantly](https://i.imgur.com/D7v60ZJ.png) and having spoken to Sharp about the book, it's about a man that's very specifically been through the end of days in Johns' run and having seen all that the universe has to offer and exploring where this guy who's been good, bad, dead, everything you can ever be is right now and how he feels. It brought back Eve Doremus, the silver age love interest who loved Hal for Hal Jordan and not Green Lantern (in contrast to Carol), which is what Hal always deeply longed for. It's set to bring back all of his love interests and plans to examine Hal through his relationships. This is a run that cares deeply for continuity and history. It's evident when you see Morrison speak on it and Carol herself-

&gt;“He has a lot of women, Hal’s had a lot of girlfriends and female characters he’s connected with over the years, and we’re bringing them all back. **Carol Ferris is his one true love with sparks and fire**, but we wanted to bring back all these different women from his past. They all have different relationships with him, and they’re not all sexual relationships. Some have a problem with him, some really like him and their husbands hate him; we’re playing a lot more with this guy who appears in your life suddenly and now Green Lantern’s sleeping on your couch for the next week. What are you going to do with him?”

&gt;""We want to explore all of those relationships, and also all of Hal Jordan’s previous relationships in the book. So Tom Kalmaku’s in issue #3. We do see a little bit of the Justice League, but they’ve been beaten. They’ve only just been beaten and Hal’s come to save the day. And all of the female characters that have been in the book, we’re bringing all of them back, and they all have very different relationships with Hal, completely different approaches to him.

&gt;So, he’s surrounded by this constellation of people that, I think they love him more than he even knows, and he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t quite get it. But I want to build another picture of him from their point of view. We’re looking at all of his friends, all of his lovers, and bringing them all back, and using them as mirrors.""

Hal clearly has a journey here, as he starts off where he does. Carol is his true love but he also has this vast history with a myriad of characters with whom he has vastly different relationships and dynamics. We're not only getting to see Hal but the book is set to be about what Hal means to everybody else, from Oliver Queen, Tom Kalmaku to even Barry Allen (Barry's in Season 2). If Hal has to be with Carol again, it has to be earned, it can't just be a cheap 2 pager, it can't just not address Carol and how she's feeling and where she's at, we need all of that. A Hal that goes through a great journey while dealing with all his history and then has a heart to heart with his true love, where we learn his perspective, feels a lot more compelling to me and that's really what we, the fans, I feel, should get rather than a random epilogue. This is a run that loves and adores Hal's great and rich history, the team isn't actively ignoring it, it's adding to it and building on it. It's why we get Controller Mu and the Blackstars, a separatist sect that permits us to have 'Evil Darkstars' without having to make the Darkstars full on bad guys, as that's not what that concept is meant for and in the long run, it's not sustainable. It's why we get Evil Star, or Belzebeth, who is a mix of Legion of Super-Heroes mythology with GL mythology.

215,"I’ll start by saying something that might be controversial: two-thirds or more of all comics are bad or pretty bad. About 20-25% are good or pretty good, and 10-5% of comics are truly exceptional.

Bad comics for me are those that have pretty bad writing, a lackluster story, pretty shallow characters, and an overall lack of innovation. Run of the mill action stories that can be pumped out really quickly with little variation to the formula.

The mid-range, the good to pretty darn good ones, for me, are those that have great writing, great stories with a lot of thought put into them or unpredictable twists, intriguing characters that are true to their overall identities in their own respective universes, and great innovation. These stories for me include titles like: Old Man Logan, Captain America: Winter Soldier (Brubaker), Hulk: Planet Hulk, The Ultimates 1 and 2, Uncanny X-Force (Remender), Kingdom Come, Court/City of Owls, Batman: Hush, Batman: Year One, Dark Night Returns, etc.

For me, the truly great and truly exceptional comics are those that have all the characteristics of the very good ones but also include some gripping, thought provoking element-some element that tackles a really serious theme or philosophical question. I think it is this truly innovative aspect that separates the good from the great in comic books. When I list some examples I think you’ll understand what I mean. Watchmen, Superman: Red Son, Batman: the Long Halloween, Maus, Superman for all Seasons, Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on a Serious Earth, Marvels, Vision (the 2016 series), etc.

I want to know what you all think. I know many who don’t really think too critically or reflect too seriously on these stories, I do though, which might explain why I think so much is just garbage. However, the example I listed arent limited to those I named and there are many “good tier” comics that approach or lightly touch on the thought provoking themes I think distinguish the “exceptional tier” comics.

229,"Let's say that in an old Batman comic, there's a detective in the background of a story about a commonly used villain, like Two-Face or Joker. He's entirely a stock character, called Detective Smith or something, and all he does is tell Batman about a key piece of information. Let's say I wrote a story later, and it features the same villain. If, in this story, I use a character with the same name as the previous detective to provide some continuity, but provide a completely new backstory and provide enough characterization that it's essentially a completely new character, who would be considered the ""creator""? Would it be the writer, who only used a stock character to further the plot, or would it be me, even though I'm deliberately establishing that it's the same character as the one in the classic story?

I don't have an opinion one way or the other, I'm just curious how this would play out. 

A few clarifications- 

-We aren't talking about a character who was initially recurring or significant in any way. They only existed for a page or two, and were never referenced again.

-The character's physical appearance is pretty much consistent in both appearances.

-In my take on the character, they'd be a major focus of the story. Think someone with a plot-relevant background of their own, who gets a decent amount of time on panel, and has a lot of agency on the direction of the plot.

Rachel has been turned fully into a Hound again, after going through it in Gold and Red recently, during the event.

An event she was barely featured in.

Now she is being used as Ahab's BDSM fetish fuel. We also know Ahab is sexually attracted to Rachel as his 616 version wanted to date and sleep with her before he became Ahab. Ahab also calls Rachel his favorite Hound and has tried to bring her back as his slave multiple times.

With her back as his BDSM slave I fully expect Marvel to put in a ton of creepy sexual innuendo and imagery with how Ahab treats Rachel. I also fully expect him to force her to carry his child or use her up breed the ultimate Hound while she is currently unable to say No or Resist.

Because whenever Jean returns they ALWAYS screw Rachel over.

Heck, in space they had Rachel sleep with Korvus AGAINST her own will. She literally couldn't say no because the Phoenix forced Rachel to desire Korvus because of Phoenix fragments. That wasn't consensual!

It is absolutely unacceptable!

Worse though?

Only Iceman cared and actually tried to help Rachel.

Jean? Her mother?

Doesn't care.

Nightcrawler? Her EX who still loves her?

Doesn't care.

Kitty? Her best friend?

Doesn't care.

Young Cable? Her brother?

Doesn't care.

Literally no X-Men BUT Iceman cared about what happened to Rachel. Jean even LETS Ahab take Rachel as his BDSM slave. Jean easily could have stopped Rachel from being taken. Instead she just stood there and watched while saying Rachel is a loss cause because she's too damaged.

None of the X-Men even desire to save Rachel aka one of their best and close friend and ally or have any plans to.

None of them.

So on top of being enslaved by Ahab again no one cares to save Rachel. Instead they are 100% fine letting Ahab do whatever he wants to Rachel and with all the time he wants to do so.

Extermination is one of the worst Marvek events since One More Day. No. Even worse than that.

Rachel has been victimized all over again only this time she's a full grown woman and Ahab has expressed interest and desire in her multiple times since. So it will be FAR WORSE.

What the heck was Marvel thinking? Who in their right mind gave the go ahead to lock Rachel, as a BDSM slave, up with the guy who tormented her and raped her mind ever since she was like 15. She still has PTSD over what he did to her!

I really liked what it did with Wolverine. I'd always thought of him as a generic bruiser type of character,but seeing him do his best for the kids and the school showed me there's a genuine guy under that hard exterior.

I was most invested in Quentin Quire's development. Seeing him evolve from a terrorist/borderline supervillian to a semi-decent person was rather satisfying. And seeing his older self as the Phoenix during battle for the atom was also cool. My one gripe is him and Idie getting together, would've liked to see her with Broo.

Most of the students were likeable and had good chemistry together. My favorites were QQ, Genesis, Kid Gladiator (kind of annoying at times but idk, I like him), Broo, and Idie. The only one I didn't like was Glob Herman, nothing redeeming for that kid. 

I liked all the teachers about the same, just wish we got to see more of Rogue, Gambit, and some of the others.

331,"My main issue is with Cliff (Robotman), Larry (Negative Man), and Vic (Cyborg).

Cliff and Larry can't emote and they're not too expressive in their movement which will provide a challenge when directing them. Cliff is voiced by Ben Fraser who is amazing, but the actor in the suit is a different guy, kinda causing some disconnect which may or may not prove to be in its favor making them a little off putting.

Vic's face plate is suppose to be integrated into his flesh. There's no real way for that to gel well. And these shows are getting a low budget. Probably especially Doom Patrol for being so niche. His body tech looks like a t-shirt. Might look better in motion. I'm more wondering why he's in the Doom Patrol since: A he and Cliff sorta have a similar storyline with they're humanity being interfered by the integration of technology, sometimes even losing themselves to it. Don't know where they'll take his story arc. But why can't he just be a Titan? Beast Boy still has a connection with them so I wouldn't be surprised if he switches over in a later season.

Crazy Jane is a Wild card since I don't know much about the actress and her ability to portray multiple personality disorder. She seems a bit moody teen hope to get a better grasp the more I see.

I do have faith in the direction of the show going with the semi-pulp horror theme with the manor and the characters. Like in the original during the silver age. And they're like an old timey family, taking group pictures having dinner together, etc. Also they're going with the mental heath root it seems since they were always characters with mental disorders and deformities. Cliff was a amputee (full body). Larry was in reference to burn victims. Rita (Elasti-girl now Elasti-woman, probably to differentiate from the Incredibles, which was a reference to the Doom Patrol ""My Greatest Adventure"") a forgotten actress. The writers seem to be going into body dismorphia which would be interesting.

They would have a bases/safe houses set up in multiple major cities (Gotham, Metropolis, Keystone, Star City, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo etc) and they would use a modified batwing for transportation.

The first arc would deal with them facing a new Brother Blood (Deacon Blackfire) in Chicago who'd be a meta human with the ability to mentally control those who ingest his blood. I'd gradually expand the roster too with Garth, Mon-el, Stargirl, Tempest, Miss Martian.

The team would save the world from an alien invasion after the league had been captured. After such a close call they'd begin aggressively expanding their members bringing back lesser utilized characters like Bunker, Bumblebee, Lagoon boy, Cassandra Cain, etc. and would split the teams in two (One led by Robin and one led by Supergirl) and there'd be a traitor who has infiltrated the team and is reporting to the secret society of super villians.

379,"TL;DR - I do think if you enjoyed Invincible and don't mind the switch in art, you will enjoy Black Hammer.  The two play with genre tropes in similar and different ways.

&amp;#x200B;

When I joined this subreddit, I was hoping to find some new comics to match my taste.  I had burned out on Marvel and DC a long time ago.  I really enjoy alternate comics that switch up the traditional good guy vs bad guy schtick that filled the books when I started.  Invincible had come to an end and I was so depressed, I waited many months before I finally bit the bullet and read the last few issues.  (It probably should have ended, but after reading that final issue Kirkman really did have many more stories to tell)  Good deconstructionist books are hard to find and I have read just about every one I could find.  Sandman and Watchmen are of course, king of the pile but Transmetropolitan, Preacher, Lucifer, Fables, the Invisibles, 100 Bullets.  Astro City was fun and scratched the itch as well, but of course you burn through those as well.  

I love alternate and edgy stories, but I have a special place in my heart for the super hero genre.  Superman was the first book to get really get me into comics, but Batman was edgy when I first started as well.  However, while I liked my early tastes of the genre, it became far too predictable after a while and I wanted newer, more realistic superheroes.  That's why I enjoyed Watchmen, Invincible and Astro City - these were heroes with real problems, who experienced true character growth.

Black Hammer is the first modern deconstructionist superhero book that I've found since Invincible.   There are probably more out there - I hope there are, I'm burning through Black Hammer quickly, but I am really enjoying it so far.  I love the Astro City vibe I'm getting from it, but it is its own book.  

No spoilers here - if you enjoyed any of the books I've mentioned above, you might enjoy Black Hammer as well.  I don't think it deserves a place beside Sandman, but it is a fun read that does clever things with the genre and fits a niche as well.

I just saw spiderverse last night and was blown away. The whole thing exceeded my already high expectations beyond what I could even believe. I was greatly moved by the “leap of faith scene” because it was powerful, but also because it’s a phrase I’ve wrestled in my head for the last five years. 

I’ve been drawn to the phrase “leap of faith” because it always felt like a great metaphor for heroism. I began to connect it to Spider-Man, the end of the killing joke and Dick Grayson (particularly as Batman).

When I google the phrase with tattoo at the end, I get a lot of religious examples. I’m hoping that the comics community can help give me some suggestions. Again, I’ve had a deep love for this phrase, have toyed with some ideas of it in the past but haven’t found the concrete answer to what form of way I want it tattooed.

61,"Apologies if this has been suggested before... but in light of recent events, I've been thinking about Stan Lee cameos. And it dawned on me... he is quite possibly the most powerful character in all comics combined (yes, even compared to Son Goku, Superman, Galacticus, Deadpool, Saitama, and Tenngen Toppa Gurren Lagaan.)

&amp;#x200B;

His power is both simple and unstoppable.

&amp;#x200B;

I refer to it as ""the nudge"".

&amp;#x200B;

Stan Lee is often there, at the onset of the beginning of a superhero's epic journey, and where ""there"" is often is in very different places. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The nudge"" is this...

Stan Lee has the power to know the consequences of his actions. Perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

So he travels, he creates superheros. Not just in our world, but in the comic book world world. He nudges people at the most crucial tipping of their lives, a casual conversation, a word... just enough to direct their thoughts in a different direction or get them to be in the right place at the right time to become their heroic self. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Earth has been on the verge of destruction so many times, but because he went around creating superheroes, the Earth and even the universe was always ready for what was to come. 

&amp;#x200B;

So many hereos were nudged into being superheros by Stan Lee.  


There was even a universe where super powers didn't work, immune from the galactic forces that create them.

98,"As a late teen early 20s I picked up a large graphic novel that a friend of mine had sitting around. Story consisted of a world wide dictator or king who ruled the world and wanted to pass on this role to his son . He had a super human guardian / cyborg created to guard the boy incase of his death. In the series the boy has to avoid being killed by his out of control mother maybe step mother and her plans to rule the world instead of him. The boy has a sister (maybe step) who has her own problems with their mother figure and runs off to live with her lesbian bodyguard and a man they meet in a three way relationship. Eventually the boy now a man meets up with his sister and along with his cybernetic bodyguard, sisters lover and men loyal to him eventually kill and supplant their mother.   


Some other details:  


* The cyborg is covered in a black armor and you cannot see his face.
* This is clearly the future after a horrific event wipes out all of the world's governments.
* Heavy incest themes are implied with the brother/sister don't remember if they got together.
* This was published at least during the late 1990s early 2000's. The quality was very good at the time considering it was a few years right before large graphic novels went mainstream and you would only find them from indy comic labels. Very thick paper for the time and extremely nice artwork. The colors were a little dull but not distracting and it could have been a choice of the artists and not for monetary concerns. 
* It might have never been published at a series and just printed as a stand alone book all I remember is the thick graphic novel.  


I know missing a lot of details but it clearly was popular enough to get a good printing during a time when most comic book stores only had one rack for indy comics at most and then almost never had full books because most people would not buy a graphic novel for 20 or 29 dollars from a series they did not follow for years.

102,"In the wake of Stan Lee's death, I've heard loads of people referring to him as ""the creator of Spider-Man"", and it's really starting to annoy me. Steve Ditko had as much to do with the creation of Spider-Man as Stan Lee did. Stan came up with the idea for the character: a teenage boy who gains the proportionate strength and agility of a spider. But Steve Ditko really finalized the character and I believe without him Spider-Man really wouldn't be the character he is today. Ditko gave Spider-Man a huge part of his personality, (not the joke-cracking side, more his inner personality at his core) as well as of course designing his iconic costume. He also had an at least slightly significant hand in the plotting of issues and arcs in the early Spider-Man comics, because back then the artist would get a rough plot and draw it out, then the writer would go in and add the dialogue. Stan was the co-creator of Spider-Man, not the only creator. This is also a testament to how critically underrepresented comic artists of that era were and are, and I feel that needs to change.
Sorry if this came off kind of like a rant, although I guess it was. I just wanted to put my thoughts down as this has really been bugging me lately. Also, I have nothing against Stan Lee or his work, I'm just saying that he shouldn't be getting all the credit for characters he co-created. Oh yeah, and I'm not saying I've seen anyone on this sub giving him full credit, it's mostly news websites and YouTubers.

I'm  praying this is the place to look for help in finding a comic I had  when I was younger. I'd love to read through it again, see if anything  came of it.

I had it in the mid to late  90s, possibly early 2000s. I can't remember the title or the artist who  drew it, but I know it reminds me of Todd Macfarlane (Spawn).

I  remember this biker looking dude. Dark black hair, big black beard.  This....the best way I can describe it is....armor that operates a lot  like Venom, like a symbiote. It attached to him. There were multiple  kinds of armor symbiote creatures, and they all duke it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I also remember a panel where a thin guy with glasses is working in front of a computer. I believe he was hacking...*something*. The memorable bit of this panel is that the guy was like....bonding with a Venom-like suit and had green lightning coming out of his eyes, from directly in the center of his glasses. 

&amp;#x200B;

This  reads like the ramblings of a complete nut, but I'm hoping this jogs  someone's memory and they can tell me what it is. If it helps, I  remember the physical copy not being like an actual comic. I think it  was more like card stock. Thicker pages, not as rough as paper.

- I loved Dafne Keen's Laura/X-23 and hope she's one of the ones who carries over. But if she doesn't and they go with an older Laura A) who'd you cast B) If they did I hope we get Gabby she's fuckin adorable (I want a Gabby/Singularity comic it'd be adorable)
- Give us the costume. Just........please
- As much as I love Jackman, I'd be fine if he didn't come back as he had the perfect ending to his story. i'm not sure who I'd cast, though I don't mind if he's short really
- I don't want another origin, but some well done version of Weapon X would be great; maybe he goes back to free some new captives/destroy the facility

293,"Hear me out

So my basic idea for Captain Marvel 2 (Captain Marvel: A-Force or Captain Marvel: Alpha Flight) is that the Kree come for the Inhumans in Attilan and capture or murder most. Then someone, be it Maximus or a Kree, sets off a Terrigenesis bomb that creates the NuHumans on Earth. The Kree then kidnap a bunch of these, including Kamala. So say Medusa was the only Inhuman to avoid capture. She, Carol, She-Hulk and some other female characters who had people close to them kidnapped team up to rescue the Inhumans from Kree enslavement. Among the kidnapped Inhumans is Kamala/Ms Marvel. She leads a group of the NuHumans/Inhumans to try and escape, and they almost get out. Anyway the A-Force arrive and help the rest escape and defeat the Kree. The end happy ever after setting up Kamala for her own spin-off (or lead in a Young Avengers/Champions movie)

I know it's unlikely, heck I wouldn't be surprised if Kamala was made an Eternal or Mutant instead but given Captain Marvel too wouldn't be until 2022 anyway I feel there's enough room for damage control/let the Inhumans rest before they get a decent version in the MCU

&amp;#x200B;

Cletus addresses rebirth—of the body and mind—and believes that Symbiosis is far more than a product of his environment, or his genes.

&amp;#x200B;

Carnage Camp comprises a body of knowledge which extends from certain fundamental truths. Prime among these are:

&amp;#x200B;

Cletus Kasady is an immortal spiritual being.

&amp;#x200B;

His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.

&amp;#x200B;

Symbiotics further holds Man to be basically good, and that his spiritual salvation depends upon himself, his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Carnage Mindset is not a dogmatic religion in which one is asked to accept anything on faith alone. On the contrary, one discovers for oneself that the principles of the Carnage Methology are true by applying its principles and observing or experiencing the results.

However, I would like to do a course of graphic analysis, but my university lacks those options, despite doing a yearly festival on the graphic medium. Still, I am able to apply for an independent study course of several credits on comics. I am wondering thought what I should do it on. Preferably on a subject I don't know much about. Her is what I have come up with so far:

-Grant Morrison: Human potential, optimism, and the occult. Invisibles, Doom Patrol, The Filth, All-Star Superman, Supergods, Flex Mentallo, Arkham Asylum

-Warren Ellis: Transhumanism, technology interactions, and discovery. Planetary, Orbiter/Ocean, FreakAngels, Transmetropolitan, Trees, SuperIdol.

-Garth Ennis- Misanthropy, Violence, and cultural conflict. Punisher Max, Hellblazer, Troubled Souls, The Boys, My War Gone By, Crossed -Alan Moore: Literary tradition, methodical deconstruction, political anarchism: Watchmen, From Hell, Lost Girls, Providence, Jeruselum

-Inio Asano: Growing up, sexuality, magical realism. Solanin, PunPun, Girl On The Shore, Wonderful World

-Osami Tezuka: Japanese history, religion, magical realism: Message to Adolf, Pheonix, Swallowing the Earth, Book of Human Insects, Ayako

-Matt Kindt: Conspiracy, outsider, psychedelic. Mind MGMT, Grass Kings, Revolver, Superspy, Pistolwhip.

Other options include protest comics of the sixties, early 1910s comics, and the Zap Comix circle. I would like to set up an interview with an expert or author as part of the course if possible. Any suggestions?

347,"DISCLAIMER: Before anybody comes in with ""NOT ALL FANS DON'T GENERALIZE!"" I know. I know it's not all fans. Generalizations happen for a reason-to discussion a broad topic/point of view. I am not blanketing all fans here, obviously. 

With enjoying fiction, I live by the rule ""who cares about anybodies opinions but your own?"" and 90% of the time it works. But comic fans...the vocal ones on the internet that is, are in a constant state of Debbie Downerness. 

It doesn't matter what title and what company, fans never seem to be able to just ENJOY reading comics. Nothing is good enough. Nothing is the way THEY feel it should be. Nothing caters to THEIR preferences enough. If a run even mildly goes against their biased status quo-it's garbage. 

Comic fans always seem to clamber for ""new, intertesting"" directions for their favorite heroes...but when a new angle IS explored these same fans bitch about it. 

""Yeah but I didn't mean do it like THAT!""

It's like they don't know what they want. These characters have been around for decades upon decades. Some are slowly nearing the 100 year mark. Are you really gonna be that anal about things and act like your understanding of a character holds more weight than the fucking writers/other fans? 

Idk...I read comics differently than most fans. I don't have a pull list and I don't read constantly. I read when I'm hankering for superheroes and choose a title/run on whimsy, mostly.  

I'm much more interested in seeing new tones/ideas/directions/themes for these characters than I am concerned about a writer adhering to my own biases. 

For example: I don't care if a current run kinda, sorta clashes with a run I love from 10/20 years ago because my enjoyment of comics has NOTHING to do with continuity or even stalwart characterization. My enjoyment comes from the writing itself. I enjoy Batgod as much as a more human-like Batman who makes mistakes. I like the boy scout Superman as much as one that is more internally conflicted. 

I like poor, down on his luck Peter Parker and a Peter Parker in charge of his own tech company.

See what a mean? Of course I have my limits as well. I'm not saying we all need to blindly love everything. But it just seems like far too many comic fans don't even try.

And yes, I could just ignore online discussion and much of the time I do-but dammit I want to enjoy robust fan discussion from time to time.

376,"What has been your impression of Marvel’s year.

My personal opinion was that it suffered from being a transitional year between Alonso and Cenulski. A lot of the first half of the year felt like treading water waiting for the relaunch we knew was coming. We got authors doing alternate reality or future storylines rather than anything substantial with the characters. Most titles peaked in 2017 and fizzled out in early 2018. Bendis jumped ship and his books wound up. Cap was stuck in a weird post secret empire limbo where nobody wanted to talk about secret empire. So he went into the future, as did Laura. Other titles got stronger endings, such as Mighty Thor and Amazing Spider-Man. 

The second half of the year was probably a rebound, with a lot of titles getting stronger with  relaunch. Personally I enjoyed it less than most reviewers, but then, I’m not the audience for the whole “back to basics” approach; I’m more interested in Miles, Riri, Amadeus and Jane Thor and found the return of Tony, Odinson and Banner a bit... same old same old? It all felt less exciting and more average to me. That said, plenty of people found a lot to like in the new Hulk, in particular, and Spencer’s Spider-Man shows promise . Coates’ Cap looks to be dealing with the post Secret Empire fallout that everyone else was too nervous to touch. I’d characterise the Thor relaunch as boring but pretty, but there’s no denying it’s pretty. And Cates’ Venom is getting some hot reviews, though I personally haven’t gotten much from it yet.

So overall I’d say that Marvel rebounded a bit with fresh start, even while I personally am less interested and looking more toward Image and smaller companies.

I haven’t mentioned the X lines much, because I’m struggling to characterise their year. It felt kind of chaotic. I feel like a bit of the X momentum from the previous year was lost; both Gold and Blue felt like they lost focus a bit, and neither really built to a climax. Tom Taylor’s X-Men Red started massively strong out of the gate, but probably needed to be bimonthly, because it felt like it lost momentum and kind of drifted into an early retirement. The Hunt for Wolverine felt badly managed, with too many inconsequential minis that went nowhere, and Return of Wolverine has so far been pretty lacklustre. 

I don’t read Deadpool but so far Skottie Young seems to be exciting people less than Duggan’s run.

I guess this sounds negative, but there have been positives too. Writers like Kelly Thompson, Donny Cates, Matt Rosenberg have reinvigorated the writing pool a bit, and others like Coates and Spencer and Ewing seem to be consolidating and improving. I think more than anything we need to see some long runs on books to let them really develop.

The first volume ended with Arachne finishing a ritual that maybe involved a cocoon in a train yard right before their first fight against the enemy organizations fighter/mage pair.

You can go check them out here

So this concludes this issue of Divinus Machina and we see Joanne deciding to approach the police to give them information about the Korean cybernetic harvesting ring she is unwillingly a part of, but what would happen if they find out about her betrayal and what sort of consequences would she have to face? Is there really a way for her to escape this brutal terrorist organization and live a life of peace and safety or will it cost her, her very life? Well to find out, you'll have to keep watching this space for the next issue of Divinus Machina which I'll be uploading next month. Let me know what you guys think s far of the story and art and any constructive feedback on how I can improve is more than welcome.

481,"So I remember looking through a comic when I was about 7 in the late 80's.  I'm pretty sure it was an Eclipse book, possibly Epic.  I know it wasn't any of the big name companies I was familiar with at the time like Dark Horse, Marvel, or DC.  About the only thing I can remember was it had detailed city art.  I think there might have been a few gags on business signs.  Pretty sure it was a futuristic city, but it might've been some type of noir.  It had a male lead.  That's all I got.

482,"So I just recently signed up for marvel unlimited, and after browsing through what to start reading I came across Ultimate Spider-Man. I’m 7 issues in right now, and I’m hooked. Easily one of the best comics I’ve ever read so far and the art is to die for.

On the flip side of things, this is my first real experience reading something Bendis wrote, and I’m finally getting what everyone’s been talking about when his dialogue gets brought up. It’s amusing for the most part, but I can see why people don’t really dig it. All in all though, this is a really good series and I can’t wait to get more into it.",SuperZer0-42,Started Ultimate Spider-Man the other day!,1543078493,15,True,comicbooks,2018-11-24

It sounds like there might be some advisable reading to do first, though. Are there any stories I should read first to really appreciate this series? My impression is that it'll reference some golden age Captain America, possibly some Marvel UK stuff.

489,"Just something that has been bothering recently. As much as comics tend to either ignore or downplay it. 

Many of the biggest Superheroes have taken a life sometime in their comic book career. 

Yet despite this, comics tend to ignore or downplay the potential consequences of such an act (at least when the act isn't being used to sensationalize a event). Or at least shy away actually going through with the act.

So my question is: Under What Circumstances Should a Superhero Kill/Not Kill a Enemy? Or what makes killing acceptable and can a Hero still be looked up to when that happens?

To be clear. I do not want Heroes to turn into killers for the sake of shock value. I do not want Heroes to be re-interpreted as ruthless Anti-Heroes. Nor am I advocating for any Watchman-esque deconstruction for the Superhero genre. I am trying to get some opinions on this particular matter and try to get a better understanding on how death/killing should be handled.",pingedme,Under What Circumstances Should a Superhero Kill/Not Kill a Enemy?,1543082494,19,True,comicbooks,2018-11-24

496,"Hi guys! 

Last night I remembered a comic I read back in the school library, maybe 15 years ago, and I really wanna discover it again, but I can only remember few things about it!

1. The main character is half human, half ogre/troll/giant or something like that - as I recall, the mother was raped by a ogre/troll/giant or something and she dies when giving birth to the main character. The dad does want anything to do with him, so I guess he is thrown out of the village?
2. I think he then joins a circus or similar - here are different abnormal people, so he fit in - he falls in love with a two-headed girl here?
3. For some reason I can't remember, they have to flee from a horde of evil something? And simply everybody the main character loves from the circus dies and he ends up filled with rage, kills and destroys the followers? And somehow ends up as the evil overlord .... aaaand that is what I can remember xD 

I really hope someone can remember this comic! thaaaanks!",priesskrig,I can't remember the name of the comic!,1543091505,3,True,comicbooks,2018-11-24
