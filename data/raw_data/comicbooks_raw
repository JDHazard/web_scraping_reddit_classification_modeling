""I am Doom, destroyer of worlds! What Gods dare stand against me?""

In this post about villains that deserve to win from /r/AskReddit, there seems to be a tremendous amount of sympathy for one Victor von Doom. I really don't understand this. Yes he has a fairly sympathetic backstory, and yes Latveria has been portrayed as a ""Land of Misfit Toys"" of sorts for the Marvel Universe. But Dr Doom has shown time and time again that he is little more than a megalomaniacal psycho at his core.

One sympathetic aspect cited in the example was that he saw that humanity is screwed in every iteration of the future, so his entire mission is to prevent that from happening. While that's technically correct, we also must understand that his idea of survival is pretty much the enslavement of humanity with him as the infallible dictator. If Marvel has taught us anything, it's that the future is utterly wide open, so even if Dr Doom believes he has ""seen all the possibilities"", that doesn't mean his version is our only hope. And his version sucks.

And let's not forget this guy is a complete dick, and always shows as much at some time or another. Take Jim Starlin's Infinity War for example. Thanos, in an effort to impress a lady, wipes out half the Marvel Universe (actually the universe in general) with one flick of the Infinity Gauntlet, leaving the other remaining half of heroes and villains to band together in desperation. They must join forces to seize the Gauntlet before Thanos brings about total destruction of them all.

Dr Doom, who is among the most brilliant of any of the MU characters, is naturally recruited to help the cause. So you would think this is a perfect opportunity for him to show his magnanimous side and fight for the good of all, right? Fuck no! He lies in wait until he sees an opportunity to grab the Gauntlet for his own and winds up completely screwing himself.

Classic villain dick move.

And thats the thing, he does this kind of stuff all the time, and has been for decades. He's not some misunderstood anti-hero. He's a super villain, and a dastardly one at that. He was even the inspiration for Darth Vader as some of you know.

And aren't we condemning the Fantastic Four by saying this? If poor Dr Doom got such a raw deal aren't they the true assholes here?

Again, I'm not buying it. While he may have some noble qualities, many villains do, Dr Doom is as bad as they come...",KensukeTanabe,"So Dr Doom is getting an awful lot of love from reddit, but I'm not buying it...",1576181078,21,True,comicbooks,2019-12-12
15,"I might be on a limb here, but I genuinely feel like these early books are dropping a heck ton of momentum that HoX and PoX set up. There's a whole world here that is so interesting, tons of possibilities, and a literal blank slate for every book. 

Jonathan Hickman has made irrevocable changes to the status quos of Fantastic Four and Avengers, and a larger part of the Marvel universe, so it's weird to me that given his coming to the X-books, and also given that a fresh new era of X-books that will likely be a basis for happens in the MCU.   


Given the weight of all of that, why are we getting books like X-force where the Professor dies, it ripples out to every book for barely an issue, and then with almost effort, they bring him back? Books like Fallen Angels that get a chance to provide us a non-problematic Psylocke, and make it the most boring thing on the planet? Books that completely ignore decades and decades of hot takes and and history of characters, to just write exceptionally lesser versions of these characters?   
Marvel has some of the best writers on payroll in the industry right now and they're giving these books to some of the worst.

I read this comic book in a library 3-5  years ago and now every time i think of Alzheimer I think of this book.  However I only vaguely remember the details but it left such a strong emotional impact on me that I want to find it again.  


some details of the book:

* there were multiple stories with unrelated plots included with this story in the book. 
* it was a fairly short read with minimal dialogue and you can finish it in \~10 minutes
* one of the story was kinda like a murder crime drama but presented in non chronological order and you had to try and piece it together.
* All the characters in the book were anthropomorphize animals (I think they were either cats or rabbits)
* the book was pretty dark in mood but nothing was really explicit  


some detail on the plot of the Alzheimer story:

* The lady is in a room where muscular men would come in and take away objects (furniture, pictures, etc.) from her room, they had dark glasses on and reminded me of the spies in spy vs spy
* everytime they take an object she would forget about the existence of it when they leave the room
* the room starts to look barren as a very homely looking living room gets stripped out of items leaving just the white walls of the room
* She was able to prevent the repo men from taking an object (a tea cup?) by remembering what it was called and she felt very happy as she held onto it and fell asleep
* she wakes up in complete white not even the room exists as if reality disappeared.

209,"I realize Bendis is ALWAYS hazy with timelines but...

Jessica was in Peter Parker's high school class. Meaning she graduated circa the comics released in 1965 and had to discover her powers before that.

The first super-villain she fought was Scorpion. Scorpion was wearing a costume closer to what he wore in ASM 29 (1965) than what he wore in Captain America #122 (1970) and was committing a petty theft, as opposed to his somewhat grander crimes in 1970.

My best guess is that she debuted sometime after the wedding of Reed and Sue Richards and probably circa the first coming of Galactus and the Kooky Quartet era of the Avengers but before The Vision debuted, Havok or Polaris joined the X-Men, and Kree-Skrull War.

We can infer that she was freed from The Purple Man circa Avengers #177 based on Jocasta's presence on the team and the reference to just returning from space (The Korvac Saga).

As to the length of the Purple Man's control, I guess it depends on whether you take the 8 months literally or in Marvel Time. Classically in Marvel Time (at five years to one), that places her abduction by Purple Man roughly concurrent with Giant Size X-Men #1 and the Jackal cloning Spider-Man. I kind of buy that as it represented a period of the Marvel Universe getting darker with the main problem being that Carol Danvers recognized Jessica and didn't debut as Ms. Marvel until 1977. That strikes me as where you have to treat the timeline as hazy since there's barely time for 8 REAL LIFE months between Carol's debut as Ms. Marvel and Jessica's recovery. Then again, I think there's relatively little issue backdating Carol's origin.

However, I don't think you can interpret Jessica's ""four year"" career as Jewel to be four REAL WORLD years because it's too tied to Spider-man's timeline. IMHO, she had to have been active well before 1974.

I understand that Gaiman probably wants some sovereignty over his own work but it's a bit strange that he's even willing to override the authority of one of comics' greatest worldbuilders.

237,"First off dispite being heavily interested in politics and having strong oppinions on related subjects, as long as the story I am reading is well done I really dont care about Undertones or jabs being thrown in here and there. It makes things topical sure but I read comics for a story period. If a story is good then I don't care if a charater sounds like a stereotype you can see on the news. 

Second off. I LOVE Neil Gaiman's Sandman. I love the Lucifer and Books of Magic series too. So when Sandman Universe came out I was stoked. I have enjoyed all branches of the series so far except for one. House of Wispers. I was originally really excited about this title. It is new. It focuses on mythologies that I am not familiar with (and I love all of these series because I am so into mythology). The story has been okay so far. But just that. OK.

With a lot of the other connected titles. There was this really clever natural way that the various creatures and mythological devices get explained. So even if you are not aware of something in particular, you ted it enough to enjoy the story. That sort of happens in House of Wispers but not as well. It also makes it harder to follow when many of the conversation bubbles are in creol  or French. I really do appreciate adding that in there to really make it feel ""authentic"" (i think thats the right word) but it is some times to the point I just feel like I am missing chunks of dialogue.  .... thats was okay though. There were some really cool things going on in the book, cool plot points, I was still down.

There were some social political undertones in the story. I was fine with a lot of it. It usualy fit the character/ made sense/ or had some relevance to the plot. There were a few times though things just felt like they were there for no reason. Didn't seem to connect with anything. I rolled my eyes and kept reading. Then the orphan girl and her cat came in the picture. In this story arch theres a typical orphan with shit surrogate parents with only a cat as a friend. The problem with this was: one, it was unclear where this was happening. The ""parents"" had a Spanish last name, but spoke with British slang. Then she runs away riding on the back of her now mutated cat friend. The cat friend tries to eat her but she basically says ""swiper no swiping"" and the cat decides to not eat her and help her instead. They end up and a closed down immigration facility. She makes some comment about whatever country she's in being a shit hole and its only hope was the immigrants it shits on. ... that was blatant. I get the character has been abused. But based on her abuse. I dont really think she would even be aware of much of the world considering she was locked up being a servant in these peoples' house for most of her life. It just felt like lazy writing and a really loud political comment that wasn't even clear what country it was directed to. It felt sloppy. 

House of Whispers has not been my favorite story in the Sandman Universe. It's been real, its been fun, but it hasn't been real fun. And if sloppy politically charged writing is going to make its way in to an already not spectacular storyline I dont really care to hear the rest of it.",Spaghettiprincess,First time quitting a series because of political overtones.,1576429468,11,True,comicbooks,2019-12-15

262,"Hey there, I'm a young artist and writer working on my main project and right now I have an idea in my head of a young hero, sort of playing off of the popularity of superman. This character is 17, and lives in chicago, he plays baseball and likes comic books. To most he would seem like a regular kid but he and his mom know that his dad was the hero Atlas, an alien send to earth by his species to try to negotiate entry into a coalition of planets but instead of reporting back he fell in love and gave birth to the main character, Miles. Atlas is in most comparable ways, Superman except that at some point late in his career as a superhero he has to leave earth to go fight in a civil war going on in space, on his planet. He leaves when miles is around 9 or 10 and then 7 years late Miles finally develops superpowers. He wants to be a hero like his dad but isnt nearly as powerful or as confident. He ends of being trained by one of his dads old superhero friends, Rex Strongman, a golden age hero. Atlas had all the works, super strength, super speed, flight, and invulnerability, and in addition he has a sort of sixth sense that kicks in where he can see how bad things or going to happen in a sort of vision a few seconds before they happen. His son Miles inherents all of these powers but what he doesn't know is that he was actually experimented on as a child, and the source of his powers is actually limited kinetic manipulation. He can rob things of they're kinetic energy and then either convert that raw strength or speed or make himself fly, or as he develops the powers he learns he can touch things to put the kinetic energy inside them which can cause them to go flying, explode or even potentially make them faster or stronger(yes I know that's not how kinetic energy works but its comic books). Anyway been working on this character for a long time and toyed with a lot of different names but I just dont have a lot of inspiration. At first I thought Atlas like his dad but part of his character motivation is breaking away from that mold. Then I had this whole thing about kids calling him Armstrong when he was little because he told them his dad was from space but that didnt seem right, that's what I'm using currently but wanted to see if other comic book people had better ideas.

267,"This evening, I decided to ""start over,"" so to speak.

In evaluating what I was buying, it seemed the titles and/or storylines I was buying were not the best for me at this stage of my life.

I believe I need a regular dose of hope in my life.  To me, that's Superman.  However, I did not feel as if I was receiving it with Bendis' current runs on Action Comics and Superman like I wanted.  I dropped them and decided to begin picking up Rebirth's Superman, to read more about Clark and Jon's lives together.  I've heard this title does a great job, having all the ""feels.""

I was catching up with King's Batman title, but wanted to read a comic character who was dealing with what I deal with.  Recently, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (moderate and recurrent), Panic Disorder, and Anxiety Disorder.  The comic characters I felt who deal with what I deal with are Daredevil and Bruce Banner.  I decided to begin picking up the Incredible Hulk at issue #300 and Daredevil at issue #227.

Also, recently, I've decided I need something more ""satanic."" I just began picking up Spawn from issue #1 last month.

With these decisions, I'm no longer buying current issues (at this time).  I'm sure my mind will change again.

Just like last year, we'll have all the nominations in this thread! Top-level comments will be the awards themselves, and you'll all make your nominations as responses. ***We will be removing top-level comments that are nominations or discussion. Keep Discussion in the Meta Discussion thread.***

The rules are pretty simple:

* You can say stuff about your nomination in your comment, but only one nomination is allowed per comment.
* Once something has been nominated, you can ""second"" the nomination by upvoting its nomination comment. Finalists for the awards shall be determined by upvotes. We'll take the top 4-7 nominees as determined by the upvote count. Please note that these threads are in contest mode, so scores are hidden and replies are randomized. Downvotes are disabled in contest mode, so don't bother as they won't count.
* Please check the comments BEFORE posting your nominee. A comic that's been nominated multiple times will only have its upvotes counted once. Mods will remove multiple nominations as they catch them, but as this is the holiday season, things will be spotty.
* Debate is encouraged, but PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE keep it civil.
* I'll add the specific eligibility requirements of each category in the corresponding top-level comment.

374,"When Conan 2099 was announced, I was looking forward to it with extreme caution.

My only exposure to Marvel's current Conan line was Gerry Duggan's first 5 issues story arc on Savage Sword of Conan (Reads much better in the B&amp;W TPB).It was by no means a great Conan story, but an enjoyable ""Conan vs Wizard"" type of story with cool Ron Garney art, swordplay and sorcery, and Duggan capturing the character's voice perfectly.

So I went in expecting a Conan story but not enthused by ""Conan in Modern times"" aspect of the story.

Thankfully Gerry Duggan and artist Roge Antonio, make it work for the part. Conan is in the Modern Marvel age ruling as king in Mexico, and when he is accepting tribute from his subjects, an altercation with a witch makes him cursed as an eternal wanderer.
 
Duggan's melodramatic narration and dialogue really captures Conan characterization as stubborn against any challenge and also shows his guile in dealing with the curse. I think its a good story for Howard's Conan fans and it shows to new readers that the character is more than just a one-dimensional brute.

Roge Antionio's artwork is good, he does bloody action scenes well which is a must for a Conan story, but I wish the backgrounds were more detailed. Erick Arcineiga's colours makes the art work IMO, with garish cyberpunk look for 2099 and earthier colours in Conan's flashbacks. I also liked how Conan was well integrated into Marvel's Universe, despite my reservations against it and I was unfamiliar with 2099 mythos and other Marvel titbits, reading about it added to the overall enjoyment of the story.

That said, there were a couple of nit-picks which sometimes made the story details feel muddled. For instance Conan is ruling as king in the modern age, yet his subjects wear and live like medieval times? Also despite living and adventuring in the present and 2099, Conan still wears a freaking loin-cloth, in contrast to the original Howard stories, where he wore appropriate clothing depending on his needs and geographic preference.

I hope writers ditch this ""loin-cloth"" stereotype as it is just tiresome at this point. Nevertheless a good story, art, and an ending that captures Conan as the quintessential adventurer really makes this comic worth reading.",DunBanner,Conan 2099 is surprisingly good one-shot comic but is also confusing.,1576576827,8,True,comicbooks,2019-12-17

388,"Both events had great writing and great art.

To me, Absolute Carnage had the better start and War of the Realms had the better ending.

I liked the plot of Absolute Carnage more but War of the Realms was easier for me to follow because I didn't have to read any tie-ins whereas in Absolute Carnage I had to read Venom or else I'd be missing a lot of important story details.

Both events featured Spider-Man. I wasn't a big fan of how Jason Aaron wrote him in War of the Realms but I absolutely loves how Donny Cates handled him in Absolute Carnage.

In the end I prefer War of the Realms. Absolute Carnage's ending felt a bit rushed and I think it would have benefitted from an oversized final issue. And despite my love for Ryan Stegman's art, Russell Dauterman's art looks more cinematic and the level of talent this guy has is outstanding. Especially with Matthew Wilson's colors.

406,"I've been catching up on G. Willow Wilson's excellent Ms. Marvel run lately and it had me thinking about Marvel characters that exist primarily outside New York City. It's always kind of surprised me that we don't see other distinct locations develop their own microcosm of supers more. There are plenty of locations that are specific to particular characters or groups but they never seem to flesh out enough to sustainably host multiple stories at once. For instance, in the recent Ironheart series you get individual Ironheart stories in her hometown of Chicago, but she's not running into other Chicago heroes and villains like, say, Spider-Man might run into Daredevil and team-up against Kingpin or something.

I could see how it might be hard to really establish a location to the extent that it self-sufficiently generates stories when everyone's already invested in the more NYC-centric Marvel universe, but it's not unprecedented in comics. Consider, for instance, the distinct roster of characters in Gotham versus the ones in Metropolis. It exists somewhat with the Marvel UK stuff, but not much else.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, could it be baked into the DNA of Marvel comics that New York so dominates its setting that other locations end up just satelites instead of hubs? In a world with mutants, science experiments gone awry, magic, aliens, etc, you'd think LA or Chicago might also have its own distinct metahuman scene of hundreds of people, let alone massive cities outside the US.",SoSorryOfficial,[Discussion] Marvel Outside NYC,1576603542,8,True,comicbooks,2019-12-17

To my surprise though, reading the Dawn of X in the order really does make it seem like one big story that just switches the perspective each issue. Only series that doesn't feel that connected is Fallen Angels but that's ending at 6 anyway. Especially X-Force and Mauraders seem like they are tackling with story that is integral to the overall narrative and Hickman's already stated that this first arc of New Mutants is laying down the groundwork for a major X-Men plot point later on.

Got to give it to Hickman.

436,"Doomsday clock will come out tomorrow 18/12/2019 on stores, wich will also mark the end of the series-event and, hopefully, will give us the resolution around the state of the time-line of the dc universe and, in general, of dc comics itself.

having read it to this point, I'll confess that, while I've liked this story, there has been something that 've made concerned about: I'm talking about(possible spoiler) the commedian's return, and the way he was brought back from the dead.

Initially, I wasn't shacken up by it because I was hopefull that Geoff Johns would have adress that issue in a way that would have been respectfull to the original work of Alan Moore,maybe by making Doctor Manhattan create two separate realities in which one Blake was saved by him, and another where he still died, for example.

But we're reaching the end, and to this day he still hasn't addressed it yet, and I'm worried that he won't at all.

Now, I'm not losing my hopes on Geoff Johns just yet; after all, we still have one issue left and the internet says it will be a long issue. My ,howeve, is this: based on what he'll do about it, his action will affect Watchmen in terms of acceptance from the community. 

based on my subjective interpretation on the subject, I think he can settle the issue with the following options:

* Making two different realities, as I mentioned at the beginning of the post
* leave it as it is, by which I mean leaving the commedian alive in the dc universe, which can still work because the original world of Watchmen will come undone for this, but the original story will still exist
* putting back the commedian where he was in the fall and **erasing his memories of the experience.**

I had to make this last point very clear because is the crux of what I'm trying to explain: the very worst thing that could happen is if the writer decides to put him back to where he was **but** with the memories still intact. Because that would give Blake something to cheer on before diyng, knowing that Ozymandias' plans came usunder after his death. That would give him hope. And hope is the foundation of the Dc universe, not of Watchmen. Watchmen was a story set on a world where heroes needed to let go of their moral principals, their thrust in the system and their hope of a better tomorrow, and take the law on their hands to carry their justice on the world, doing whatever was necessary, even murdering innocents. So putting the concept of hope in a world like this would clash with its atmosphere, making the tone inconsistent. Not to mention that it would make Ozymandias an actual villain, when he was more like the antagonist of the story: he may had killed innocent people, but he didn't do anything different from what his other collegues did in their careers. He was still a hero, doing everything he could to save the world.

The reason why I'm expressing my concern is not for my sensibility, because even if the worst happens, I could still treat it like a separate thing, same as other older readers. What vorries me, is that when new readers will give Watchmen a try, after they read Doomsday clock, while some can treat it as a separate thing like me, others will be left confused or won't appreaciate the story for what it is, which is a deconstruction of the superhero genre, becuase Doomsday clock will influence the tone of the story.

And that's all I want to say. I don't expect to recieve prize for this post, since it could be percieved as an unpopular opinion, but I hope we can all have a peacefull and respectfull conversation and that I'm not alone in this.",MaskMakerDollar251,Possibly unpopular opinion: I think Doomsday Clock could possibly harm the quality of Watchmen,1576627056,10,True,comicbooks,2019-12-17

79,"It was first published in those anthology books sold at Wallmart, and I'm afraid it will never get the recognition it deserves because of that.

A girl is kidnapped in Gotham. But not by the usual villains. One day, an alien life-form simply abducts her, for no apparent reason. No one knows where the girl may be in the universe. No one knows who did that. There are no leads to follow. There's no guarantee that the girl is even alive. But she might be, and if she is, she might be scared and hoping that someone, anyone, cares enough about her to rescue her.

So Clark drops everything he has on Earth and goes up in the sky, not knowing how much time it will take or if he can succeed, to look for this missing girl that can be anywhere in the cosmos.

On his way, Superman has to face trials as physical as a boxing match to as spiritual as a Faustian bargain, and everything in between. Throw in some occasional surprises like an unexpected crossover with Sargent Rock, and this easily became one of my favorite reads of the year.

Sadly, the only attention this story ever got was a minor controversy caused by a chapter showing many deaths of Lois Lane, which sparked another talk about ""fridging"" in comics. It couldn't be more unfair. It's basically Superman overthinking things and imagining what kinds of tragedies might have happened with his loved ones since he was away. In the context of the story, this stressed out and homesick Superman even comes across as funny. This is a story in which Clark exposes his opinion on humanity and the world during a casual talk about food with a child. It deserves better than minor controversies.

Ah, and Kubert is at his peak, too. The boxing issue and the Sgt. Rock crossover look fantastic.

Now, Im not saying that it is a reflection on the Movie, as I haven't seen it and also have mad respect for all parties that take part in the production of any film, it is a lot of work, but I feel like the film looks very low poly and cheep even for a first trailer.   


DC make awesome Comics and I think it's hard to translate that into live action?  
The new joker film is a prime example of DC films that **work**. Doing character pieces instead of ""another super hero film"" the formula needs a revamp but I feel like the film executives play it safe as to not upset the public.  


The Joker was Barraged so much with the whole ""incel violence imminent"" thing that it was almost comedic at times.

After some reading up, I'm leaning towards the Absolute editions. However one part of me feels like he'd also appreciate the original single-issues for their sheer collectibility and sentimental value.

I'm obviously not a comic book person -- would love to get your thoughts on which is a better balance of practicality and collectibility.

Or is there some way of mixing and matching, such as buying particularly collectible issues on top of Absolute volumes?

But in the grand scheme of things, he really took all the great elements of Arrow, and weaved them into the Green Arrow character while also bringing great new things like the reimagining of what the Island means, as well as the legacy of the archer. All with stunning Sorrentino art.

Funny thing is, is that at the time, it was considered by most to be the best comic book on the stands, even topping Scott Snyder's Batman book which won the previous year, and people were talking about it finally being the book to make Green Arrow special and no longer a Batman clone but as the years went through, all that seems to have faded away.

You realize there is literally no advertising for comics ,not the movies, the comics. None on highstreets and they can still sell millions of issues as an industry. 


**Readers self sustain interest.**

We are here , doing it now. Self sustaining the market.


**Comics Vs Music : Getting paid as a creator**

Have you seen the price of comics??!

Music has much higher costs: videos to shoot , marketing campaigns, flying people for press,paying music producers, engineers , and much more all before a single record is sold, while physical sales are dead, digital pays next to nothing. But music artists get paid! even if they &lt;cough&gt; didn't write it make the songs.

Comics to create have much lower costs and while physical music records are dying ,  comics and graphic novels continue. The reason why you don't see comics creators showboating their wealth is because comics is where the Music industry was in the 60s with horrible contracts and biased wealth return on work done. 

This is at the core of Alan Moore's beef with DC.

over the years court cases and precedents and modern business practice have given musicians a completely different standing and compensation even if the costs of production are way higher.


**Distribution Monopoly?**

DIAMOND the distributors of the majority of comics looks like a monopoly from the outside.Who exactly are their competition in the physical market?


**Pretends it's a niche geeky small market cottage industry.**

Yet over 100, 000 people turn up to the UK MCM Comiccon. More than turn up to Englands National football Team. This provides a base level audience for films and other media.

For those who don't know an elemental villain is a villain who is just evil there is no sympathy for them nor for their actions, they are just evil the prime example of the elemental villain is Joker, not the Joaquin Phoenix Joker. I'm talking about the Joker that just lashes out at society for the heck of it, that is a prime example of an elemental villain. We have been getting a lot of fallen villains which are villains who may have a sympathetic backstory or they have an arc that slowly leads them to villainy, two face is a great example for the fallen villain. The lesson that the elemental villains teach us is that people's actions can't be sympathized with nor can they be understood as to why they do what they do, they are just evil. They show us that some people are just evil no other explanation.

Months ago, I started reading from the Schism (2010) onward, skipping nothing. I found myself enjoying it greatly, even parts that the general onion seems to be negative.

But I just finished the 2016 comics, that culminated in X-Men vs Inhumans and... it isn't just that it's bad, it's that it flat out makes no sense.

For the whole year, they kept teasing of some stuff that happened in the 8-month-timeskip. Apparently Cyclops did something **horrible**. Everyone hates him (again). Humans, Inhumans, mutants. This is despite the hopeful ending of Uncanny X-Men with Cyclops making his peace with the world.

And then Death of X reveals that all he (actually an illusion of him, but that's besides the point) ever did was... neutralize a terrigen cloud? And somehow that prompted everyone to hate him more than anything ever?

And them the inhumans execute x-men in front of everyone and mutants, including the likes of Magneto and Storm, are perfectly fine with it and just shrug it off?

The whole year was based on this ""mysterious thing"", and when it was finally revealed, it doesn't fit the hole at all.

330,"You may be familiar with [Tom King's suggestion that influential contributors get co-creator credits.](https://www.cbr.com/batman-tom-king-creator-credits-oneil-adams-englehart-rogers-miller/)

I kind of agree, but I will say that ""creator"" too strongly implies ""originator"" which can lead to misinterpretation and confusion. Instead, I nominate **""defined by""** as a suitably reverent and all-inclusive term. Thus in Tom King’s example…

&gt; *Batman defined by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, Denny O'Neil, Neal Adams, Steve Englehart, Marshall Rogers, and Frank Miller.*

But whereas the traditional method of identifying authorship is fairly straightforward — whoever’s names are on the credits page of a character’s first appearance — King asks for a more nuanced evaluation of credit. But this can get complicated and subjective. It calls into question what constitutes a character in the first place?

I LOVE this question — it’s one I’ve given some thought to. I suggest that a character is defined by 4 distinct facets:

[\(I made a diagram\)](https://images2.imgbox.com/84/aa/6d4NL5y7_o.jpg)

* **Entity:** Both perfunctory yet integral, this refers to the character’s individual “self.” It is the basic element that makes Jack Kirby’s and Joe Simon’s Bucky the same character as Ed Brubaker’s and Steve Epting’s Winter Soldier. Whereas each of the other three traits can change dramatically, the continuity of consciousness creates an indelible link to its previous incarnations. 
* **Design:** The fundamental visual appearance of a character. It’s the property that allows people who look nothing alike (Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck) to disappear into the iconic entity we recognize as Batman.
* **Characterization:** The personality and attitude of a character defines the choices they make and the way they respond to the world around them. Though possessing identical power sets, the contrast between Plastic Man’s lighthearted frivolity and Mister Fantastic’s intellectual seriousness illustrates why character relies on characterization.
* **Worldbuilding:** Transformative events (exposure to chemical waste, loss of loved one, etc.) and individual elements (Hell’s Kitchen, a Batmobile, Kryptonite, etc.) can become so tightly integrated with a character that they become associated with and an extension of that character.

---

**So, let me apply this to a character like Wolverine…**

Wolverine is an excellent example of a character that has been developed significantly since he showed up as an antagonist in Incredible Hulk #181-182. He stemmed from a concept by editor-in-chief, designed by Marvel’s art director, fleshed out by a writer who had just a few issues with the character, developed dramatically over decades by another writer, with a selection of other artists and writers contributing here and there.

Here is just one guy’s take on who defined Wolverine, with totally arbitrary percentages, because I have a OCD urge to quantify everything…

**Chris Claremont (~40%)**

* “Logan” name
* claws as part of body
* Adamantium reinforced bones
* healing factor
* mysterious backstory
* character development

**Len Wein (~10%)**

* mutant animal senses
* ferocious attitude
* Government agent

**John Romita (~10%)**

* original costume, claws

**John Byrne (~10%)**

* brown &amp; tan costume variant
* advanced age, war veteran, Alpha Flight

**Dave Cockrum (~5%)**

* distinctive hairstyle

**Gil Kane (~5%)**

* iconic cowl

**Barry Windsor Smith (~5%)**

* Weapon X background

**Paul Jenkins / Joe Quesada / Bill Jemas (~5%)**

* “James Howlett” name
* youth background

**Roy Thomas (~5%)**

* “Wolverine” name
* Canadian

**Frank Miller (~4%)**

* Japanese samurai background

**Bob Harras* (~1%)** *(Wolverine #75 writer Larry Hama has reported that he was against the idea of bone claws, so I’m guessing it was X-Men editor Harras that conceived it?)*

 I've only remember reading the first issue and for some reason it came back to me and now I really want to try and find it to finish it.

So the plot of the first issue at least went like this. There was this weird cube that was gifted to this kid by some old gypsy lady for helping her out with something. He ends up bringing it to a big comicbook shop that was having a huge book signing so there was a lot of people there due to the demand of comics at the time. Something happened and the cube basically made this huge flash. And somehow it ended up giving a handful of people in this town powers. The kid mentioned earlier had a small group of friends, which was pretty diverse. All ended up getting powers. All relating to basically there personality.

The one thing that sticks out to me the most was at one point the kids were already basically fighting this other kid who gained supersmarts and trapped these kids in a almost X-men like training room and one of the friends in the group, a young Asian girl, mentioned that she learned her English by reading wolverine.

I'm not taking about the number of issues or comics, I'm talking about the superheroines themselves, the characters themselves. Like, hypothetically speaking, if you know someone who has written 500 issues of a She Hulk series (series of comics with her name on it/dedicated to her, not Avengers or F4 comics that feature her as well) but She-Hulk is the only superheroine he/she has ever worked on, that's not who I'm looking for. I'm instead looking for someone who has written series/runs/comics about a lot of female superheroes, regardless of how many issues collectively that someone has written.

I first thought of Mark Waid, but then I remembered he has only written Supergirl and The Legion of Superheroes, Black Widow: Shield's Most Wanted, the recent Invisible Woman comic, and Star Wars: Princess Leia (well, Leia isn't technically a superhero, but eh.) Still, even with counting his Leia run, that would only be 4. Or maybe I'm missing something?


Next, Gail Simone came to mind, but she has written Wonder Woman (her own run), Batgirl (2011 run), Birds of Prey, and Red Sonja (vol 2 of someone else's run and also her own run), that's still not much, only 4 (for the sake of simplicity and fairness, I decided to count teams like Birds of Prey as just one ""character"").

The only character I was able to figure out the name of was Hombre de Hierro (the Iron Man/Man of Iron). Unfortunately I have still not been able to discover the names of these other individual, or discover the existence of others. So I thought i'd come here and ask for help. I will post pictures below with a mild description.

39,"I need to rant a little bit about this: there's a difference between a character's popularity among readers and their popularity in-universe, and it irritates me when comic writers confuse the latter with the former. It's something that comes up in a couple of series that I otherwise really like.

Geoff Johns' run on ""Aquaman"" is great: it does a really good job of relaunching the character, taking a lot of inspiration from his Silver-Age backstory but updated for modern storytelling standards. But the character had that whole ""Aquaman is lame!"" meme following him ever since the *Super Friends* cartoon, so Johns decided to directly reference and refute that in his first issue. First time we see Aquaman he stops some criminals making a getaway on the street, and they're all like ""Aw man, we got stopped by *Aquaman*? That's so lame! We'll never live it down!""

Here's the thing, though: in the DC universe, no one's going to think that Aquaman is lame. The *Super Friends* cartoon doesn't exist in this universe, and Aquaman is a public figure, a Justice League founder, and one superhero among many others that have less-impressive-sounding powers than his or no powers at all. I can easily buy Aquaman being *unpopular* in-universe, but that'd be because he comes off as weird or off-putting or confusing – not because people don't take him seriously. 

Another example comes from James Robinson's ""Starman"", with the character Will Payton. There's one flashback issue set during Will's time as Starman, which begins with Will doing an internal monologue about how no one seems to like him and also features a villain doing a long villain-speech about how Will sucks as a hero because he's got ""no edge"". Now, I have no idea if Will Payton was an unpopular character or not at the time but I can believe he was, because he was a genuinely altruistic and wholesome hero who got invented very soon after ""The Dark Knight Returns"" established that Comics Are **Dark** and **Serious** and **For Adults** and **They're Called Graphic Novels Actually**. (Personally I like Will Payton for pretty much the same reasons I like Captain America, and I think that disliking him because he's not edgy is like getting mad at Steve Rogers because he isn't Spider-Man.) 

But again – I've read all of Roger Stern's run on the ""Starman"" series with Will, and in-universe *he wasn't unpopular*. For the most part he was just obscure because he was a new hero who mostly operated in the city of Phoenix and around the rest of the American southwest, and he was a popular hero among the people who knew about him. As I said, Robinson's ""Starman"" is one of my favourite comic series of all time, but that whole ""You're unpopular because you have no edge"" thing doesn't feel like something that honestly comes from in-universe: it comes off like Robinson using that villain as a mouthpiece to talk about why he himself does not like Will Payton.",Cole-Spudmoney,[Discussion] When comic books get too meta about their characters,1575169192,18,True,comicbooks,2019-11-30

65,"I moved out of my mom's house and across the country for grad school a few years ago, leaving my longboxes behind. After I graduated and decided to stay out here, I decided it was time to bring back my comics. So when I visited earlier this year,  I went through all my boxes, filtered for the ones I really wanted to keep, and packed them in a bunch of shortboxes to send to my apartment across the country. As I was sorting through all my books (which I generally kept fairly well organized) I was devastated to find I was missing a ton of my favorite books from before I left for college. All of my *Saga*s, *Chew*s, *East of West*s, *Black Science*s, *Lazarus*es, *Unwritten*s, etc – gone. I scoured the house for them, but there was nothing to find. I'm sure I could've replaced them with trades, but it wouldn't be the same.

I tried everything I could think of to look elsewhere: contacting my old undergrad residence hall, an old apartment –anywhere I might've had them with me and left them behind – but came up with nothing. Did I leave them in a box in the trunk of the car I sold? Did my mom somehow throw them away? Did someone find them in my old closet and try to hock them? Who knows?

 I've come back to visit home a couple more times since then, and I always give a cursory search to see if there was something I missed, but no such luck.

After being really bummed for a few months I came back to visit again over Thanksgiving. I hadn't bothered to search again, but as I was packing on the last day of my trip, I decided to give *one more* look before giving up. I found one uhaul moving box tucked away in a corner that I had somehow never searched before, opened it up, and lo and behold – a trove containing all my missing books! I packed up as much as I could in an old suitcase my mom was planning on giving away and brought them home with me on the plane, leaving the rest to be shipped next time I come back.

I'm thinking that things which tie in with shows and movies currently popular will have an appeal. But my personal interests are both recent, and not very broad.

I'm interested in both physical and digital. I've checked amazon but they don't have practically anything I've searched for and everything I have found has been expensive (Operación Bolívar for $500?

174,"You can just read the main War of the Realms series, not read any tie-ins, and you won't miss any important plot points.

That's crazy. That's what I've always wanted from an event, but I've never seen it properly executed.

I feel like I've been conditioned that ""you must read all of the tie-ins to understand the full scope of the event"" or ""if you're not going to read all the tie-ins then you at least MUST read any tie-in that is written by the writer of the event"".

But War of the Realms genuinely manages to transcend that conditioning. All of the tie-ins are relevant, but not a single one is necessary to War of the Realms. Not even the Thor and Avengers tie-in issues written by Jason Aaron are necessary, they just provide context.

And that's not to say that the tie-ins are bad. I personally loved how Journey into Mystery and Strikeforce managed to find an interesting story to tell without interfering with the main War of the Realms narrative.

236,"I feel like story telling wise, Marvel, DC, Image, Dark Horse, or whoever, if they want to start a extended universe (or years down the line if they want to do another) need to do it via TV.

Like, I'll use DC for example because that is my favorite comic company. If they, instead of doing the DCEU, gave a huge budget to HBO or another big channel that allows pretty much anything, and told them to make a Batman show, then after one season of that, doing a Superman show, etc etc. that would benefit way more. Than do it similar to the Arrowverse where once a year they all crossover and we have like a Justice League episode. Then years in the future, all of the shows could end at the same time and a new show could start that would be the Justice League.

I feel like the only benefit movies get is the budget and the audience. But if they gave a TV show a really big budget and it had good enough writers to pull in a big audience than we would get:

1. More in depth looks at the characters 

2. more world building

3. More characters

4. More stories

Like I don't think they could ever do every Robin in a movie universe. I think the very minimum of that you could do is 4 movies (Batman solo through half the first then getting Dick, him having Jason and Dick in the second one but Dick leaving at the end, Jason dying at the start of the third one, time jump, now he has Tim and fights Red Hood, fourth one we hear that Tim has left Batman and Damian shows up) but with a show you not only could have every Robin but you could flesh them out (you would, probably, have to make them older like 17 when they start with Batman except Damian). 

This would also benefit villains a lot. They could have a lot of reoccurring villains that we end up loving (like Gotham did with Riddler, Penguin, and Jerome/Jeremiah) and we can have them live up to their comic book counterpart better and actually seem like a threat vs something that gets dealt with in a few days like in movies. 

Marvel would benefit from this too. We could actually have a whole season of Tony Stark being an alcoholic and then something happening where he has to change and in the next season he is battling with it mentally. We could have smaller heroes show up such as a Punisher and Spider-Man episode of Spider-Man. A Moon Knight episode of Black Widow. 

And, with shows, depending on how big they want to go, they could give all of those smaller characters shows too, maybe with smaller budgets, or animated, or even just 1 season to really develop the character. It makes the world feel more lived in.",jordan999fire,[Discussion] Shows Would Benefit Comic Books More Than Movies,1575352124,16,True,comicbooks,2019-12-03

307,"I think comic books in America began their downward spiral back in the 90's. They caught on with gen x in the 80's and so the production value and the price of comic books started going through the roof. In the 80's, little kids could afford to buy comic books but in the 90's they price got over 4 bucks each. Instead of dot matrix printing and cheap newspaper grade paper comic companies started using thick glossy pages and expensive printing techniques and because of the cost involved they started devoting their resources to established properties rather than experimental comics and new writers.

 But then during the Obama admin comic books were reduced to political propaganda. Comiuc books have always had political overtones- superman was originally based on Neitzsche's philosophy, for example. But now they started engagin in blatant propaganda like have Obama on the cover of spiderman, etc. That tactic of using comic books strictly as propaganda broadened to where it is now, with comics just being horrible extreme left trash and writers getting hired strictly for their political views (looking at you zoe quinn) and stories just being woke garbage. Meanwhile, the Japanese were still cranking out good comic books and so the crowd that used to read comic books has switched over to manga. While American comics are only concerned with making superman black and batman a tranny, kodansha is still publishing things like Attack on Titan, which is a good, well written manga.

308,"This is a very specific question about numbering that's been bugging me for a while now, why did Ultimate Spider-Man skip #149? The ""final"" issue of the original numbering is #133 (the Ultimatum arc), then it relaunches with a new #1. This relaunch continues until it reaches #15, and then...we get a double-sized #150. Except that doesn't equal #150. If the book had never been relaunched and continued with the original numbering, what was once #15 would now be #148, _not_ #149. 

Now I know _why_ Marvel did this, because comic book numbering is a joke and they wanted to jack up the price for an ""milestone issue"" without waiting another month. But was there any official explanation? Did they decide to count the ""Super Special #1"" that's about the Lizard? I know Marvel and DC grab whatever they can to pump out anniversary issues every year, like how Superior Spider-Man's original run was counted as Amazing Spider-Man issues.

382,"Hey comic fam. I am in a bit of a situation as a seller on a well known online comic store and would like a perspective from others on how to possibly resolve this and get back on the ball. I thank you in advance for all help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and our very small team currently have 5 large storage units that are PACKED to the brim with comics. At his point, they are getting in the way and un-organize-able. One unit has everything from all brands from the past year. Marvel is now staying in their shipped boxes because there is no more room for short boxes to fit on the tables. Store exclusives are another monster. There are two units dedicated specifically to them and they are completely full that now, some stacks are staying in the recent books room. It takes space away from what could be. Boxes upon boxes of the same exact book, and they don't look like they are moving in bulk anytime soon. Its slowing down shipping time and we just need a better system. Not sure how to dig ourselves of what feels like a deep hole of comic books.

&amp;#x200B;

First thought was to just buy another unit, but I feel like that isnt the right solution. There are two solutions that might help at the moment, but could sure use more. One idea was to make an incentive that for a duration of time, if the customer spends a certain amount of money, lets say $150-200, then they get a free store exclusive variant worth $35-50. It gives incentive to spend more which makes up for the value of the book, which would be sitting in a box anyway if not for the purchase, creating some room hopefully and creating a influx of customers. Second thing would be to dedicate 2 units specifically to marvel, one unit to DC and Indies, and the remaining two units can be for store exclusive variants. Marvel will have a bit of breathing room, but that will close up pretty fast, so it is not like the space is a waste. I want to just get back in order so that future purchases can be sent out with no delay.

Not sure if any of you have had to deal with a situation similar to this one and what methods you used to fix it. Thinking of extending holiday sales to keep sales volume up, but the organized aspect of it would still be an issue. Any help on going the proper direction would be greatly appreciated.

388,"[Gasoline Alley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_Alley) is an old newspaper strip that has been running for the past hundred years. It is pretty basic in its premise, but the cool thing is that the cast grows with the times. I came across it while doing a project on comics, and I wanted to look at some specific dates.

The weird thing is that a lot of the years seem to have been lost to the ages. I’ve found multiple blogs talking about the comics, and [one](https://hobbylark.com/fandoms/A-Gasoline-Alley-Timeline) even posted a timeline for the comic strip’s events. But I’ve been unable to find many of the years - mostly from the 30s to the 60s. I found a site that claims to have a few of the decades, but it’s taking a while to download and the quality might be terrible. Some of the years are missing, too.

I’m curious as to how I can go about reading this comic now. I’m hoping it isn’t lost to the ages. Is there some resource out there that may have all the comics saved?",August_30th,Where can I read the old comic strip Gasoline Alley?,1575478959,2,True,comicbooks,2019-12-04

According to the cinematographer, they only used about 10% of Snyder's footage. So from a fan of the movie making process that makes me very curious to see how different they are compared to each other. His version and the final theatrical version.
So many people hate that movie already, releasing extra stuff about it wouldn't make people hate it even more. Too late for that. 
And from a business standpoint, Snyder has some ravenous fans who would gladly throw money at anything with his name attached to it. So Warner Brothers has nothing to lose by releasing it either.
If it were up to me, I would release one massive box set. Similar to Terry Gilliam Criterion Collection version of Brazil.

573,"This is something I have wanted to talk about for a while and I don’t think many people noticed. In the city of bane arc we see that Tim is back and wearing his old (new?) robin costume, we know that he participated in the arc and helps the bat family handle  Bane, we also know that Tim knows Alfred is dead based on issue 82-83 of the city of bane arc where the rest of the bat fam fights bane to avenge Alfred. 

Fast forward to the YJ arc, we know that Tim starts off with the team in his third robin costume, he goes and gets lost in the multiverse and comes back to earth with a new suit and new Drake identity. In the recent issue of YJ, Tim says he called Alfred but Alfred didn’t respond, but doesn’t he know that Alfred is dead? Because he was there, in Gotham with his family fighting to avenge Alfred.

This isn’t adding up, did city of bane take place right before Tim went off with YJ? If it did then Tim would know that Alfred is dead. City of bane could not have taken place during or after the YJ multiverse arc. Tim could not possibly have been exploring the multiverse and be in Gotham at the same time, and he couldn’t have been doing so in two different costumes. City of bane couldn’t have taken place after YJ got back, because if it did then Tim would be in his Drake suit.

14,"This is very long. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Some background: I've been reading comics since I was a kid (I'm in my 30s now) , but never had a store in my area. One finally opened when I was 13, and I was so excited to have my own pull list and chat with the store employees about my favorite books (Fables and Ed Brubaker's Catwoman at the time).

And then I hit puberty. Suddenly the owner started making inappropriate comments to me, touching my shoulder or my wrist, asking for hugs, etc. He even gave me his phone number at one point. But there were no other stores in my area, so I just made sure I took a parent with me when I picked up my books.

Once I had my own car, I was able to make excursions a little farther out to other shops. I thought the thing with my shop was just an anomoly. While I've never had an experience quite as terrible as the one with my first shop, it soon became clear that as a teenage girl, I was not welcome in any shop I went to UNLESS I was willing to flirt with whatever dude was working. My sincerity was questioned, I was mocked, my purchases were made fun of.

I put up with all of it because I loved comics, and I wasn't going to let a few assholes ruin my passion for me.

When I left for college in a medium-sized city, the first things I did were locate the library and the comic book store. It was a small shop, crammed with long boxes of back issues upon back issues.

And to my utter surprise and bafflement, the older guy working there greeted me with a genuine smile, asked if I was a new student, and gave me a tour of the store. He asked about what I liked and we found out we were both really into Elf Quest. He was at least 30 years older than me, but treated me with respect and kindness. 

I was broke and couldn't afford to maintain my pull list, but over the next few years I went in whenever I had a little extra money to spend. Even if I didn't buy anything, it was so nice to just chat to Bruce (not his real name) about what was new and hear his stories about brush-ins with comic celebrities.

After I graduated college and got a real job, I went in and set up my pull list. Since then, Bruce and I have become genuine friends. We play a tabletop RPG together and still nerd out about Elf Quest and now Giant Days. He's just an all around great dude who knows his stuff. 

Unfortunately, the store isn't doing well, which I've known for awhile. So the owner made the rash and poor decision to fire his most knowledgeable, most well-loved employee (who I'm sure was also the most expensive). I could be wrong, but to my knowledge he did not attempt to change strategies or enact any other cost saving measures.

It may sound petty or vindictive on my part to break up with the store over what amounts to a shitty financial situation, but I can't over emphasize how important it was for me as a young nerd to find a safe, welcoming comics space. Everyone who works at the shop is nice, but no one is as knowledgeable, considerate, or well-loved as Bruce. And no one else went out of their way to welcome me and make me feel at home.

So I made a tough choice and cancelled my pull list. I'll be signing up at another local shop that has made great strides in hiring women and POC employees in recent years. But I'm super bummed that it came to this, and that my friend lost his job in such a crappy way. It feels kind of like an actual breakup.

TL;DR: I was sexually harassed and made to feel unwelcome and/or unsafe in every comic shop I visited until I found a great shop staffed by an older guy who wasn't a creep and made me feel welcome. I've been going to that shop for 15 years now, but he just got fired because the shop's not doing well. So I broke up with the shop and it feels like I broke up with a romantic partner.",thewonderelf,I just broke up with my comic shop of 15 years because the owner fired the first person who made me (a woman) feel safe and welcome in a comic shop,1574629882,146,True,comicbooks,2019-11-24
24,In the MCU and DCEU I understand the limitations of the live action movies and tv shows. So I see why characters are nerfed. But in the cartoons you would think it would be the best form of media or platform to showcase how strong these characters are and be more accurate to their comic book counterparts. For example on the cartoon call avengers assemble. The avengers are struggling to carry a plane. Keep in mine it took hulk thor iron man and the help of two squadron supreme members to help carry this plane. A plane guys iron man hulk thor needed help to carry a plane guys 🤔. Another example is in Justice League unlimited (love this cartoon btw). But superman is so weak that every villain he faces superman struggle to beat them. And one villain superman struggle to beat couldn't even lift up a firetruck. He struggle with villains you would think would not give superman a hard time.

28,"TL;DR at the bottom.

So years ago I loaned a bunch of comics from my old library and the art style and setting still fascinates me. I really want to find this comic series back. The only problem is: the library moved and in the process sold off a lot of books. I haven't been able to find them. I've looked online for ages but have yet to find the series. What I do have is references to similar styled artists and somewhat of an idea of the setting. Perhaps people can help me find this elusive series.

First off I don't know where this series comes from or how many editions there are, but I know from what I read that there is at least more than two volumes to this series. My guess is that it is a French comic. From what I can recall it is about a blond, sleek haired boy that at some point needs to sneak into a strange medieval town. The whole setting is somewhat absurd, with lots of characters wearing masks and a general carnaval-esque magic feel to it all. Also, everyone seems to be able to tell that this kid is the only human in the world that it all plays out in and him being discovered as being a human was an important driving plotpoint.

The closest semblance I found in drawing style is the work of Jean-Batiste Andreae. Also the setting seems to resemble his work on Terra Mechanica, except the style of the comic I am looking for is a little less realistic than the work of Andreae and a bit flatter in shading and brighter in colors. What I remember is that it also looks like the flatter styles that Jean Giraud (Moebius) used to draw in. 

I've searched all over the web but have failed. Perhaps you, mighty reddit hivemind, can helo me find this comic. I would he forever grateful.

TL;DR: loaned a comic book in the past, cannot find it anywhere anymore. Likely French based on similar drawing styles and general story setting. About a blond boy in a medieval carnaval-esque world in which he is the only human.",howicallmyselfonline,Trying to find a comicbook series that my old library sold when they moved.

30,"Anyone who is a Comic Book fan and has been reading comics for a long time know that comic book artist and writers weren't always treated the best, anyone who isn't sadly doesn't know what went on behind closed doors. For most of the time comic book characters have existed, the actual business itself has been marginal, money wise. DC comics didn't mention Superman's creators Jerry Siegel or Joe Shuster for decades, and the lawsuit filed by those two to get the rights to Superman back was settled after they both died, and in DC's favor. Bill Finger was practically erased from History before Family members and friends had to fight a huge legal battle just to have his name credited as co-creator of Batman. Martin Goodman, the publisher of Timely comics, didn't give a shit about comics, He sold Marvel in the mid-60s when they were in their prime, simply because he was tired of it and had no idea what  artist like Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the others were accomplishing. The entire staff basically had to ask for their jobs back with the new owners. Ever hear of Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Ironman, The Hulk? Yes, even marginal fans may know this now but most people, until very very recently, weren't even marginal comic book fans. I feel this made it easier for these companies to take advantage of their creators. 

The one example that gets to me however is  what Leah Moore said about Alan Moore on twitter. Now I know Alan Moore gets a lot of shit for being a cranky old man that hates everything and doesn't understand how the world works but the is an interesting read:

The idea that the man who loved superhero stories so much he gave up his job and plunged recklessly into writing comics, which at that time was insane of him to do, loved them so much he filled every panel (and arguably every balloon and caption) with that love, loved them so much he tried to make them into something that provoked thought and feelings, that addressed issues, that spoke to people the way superheroes had always spoken to him. That seems crazy to me. I have his collection of Marvel comics, dogeared from reading, from love.

[...]

His problem was that the medium he adored was ruled by corrupt despots, that the people who made that magic were abused, that their contribution was not valued, that it was stolen from them. He already hated that before Watchmen. He already knew Kirby had been shafted.

[...]

To see him dismissed as Crazy Old Alan Moore again and again, and people not know what made him that way? To see people dissing him when their job, their industry their medium was partly built on 40 years of his hard work? I am not heartbroken, just really fucking disappointed. Can you imagine if he hadnt been fucked over? If instead of being Grumpy Alan Moore Shouting From His Cave he had spent the past 40 years putting out book after book for DC and the rest? Creating vast worlds full of the superheroes he loves? Enjoying comics? Its a damn shame.

And from the interview itself, in a section which could really do with being shared at least as much as the post-Scorcese comments:

I’m afraid that for a few years now, I have felt that since I am apparently not allowed to own the work that I created in the same manner that an author in a more grown-up and worthwhile field might expect to do, and since my protests at having my work stolen from me are interpreted by a surely young-at-heart and non-unionised audience as evidence of my “grouchiness” and “cantankerousness”, then the only active position that is left to me is to disown the works in question. I no longer own copies of these books and, other than the earnest creative work that I put into them at the time, my only associations with these works are broken friendships, perfectly ordinary corporate betrayals and wasted effort. Given that I will certainly never be reading any of these works again and that I have no wish to see them or even to think of them, it follows that I don’t wish to discuss them, sign copies of them or, indeed, have anything to do with them.

I am a 19 year old guy who really enjoys comics. I have only seen movie/tv adaptions or game adaptions of Batman, Spider Man ( I actually learned to read from a Spider Man issue back when I was 5 or 6.) and so on, but I find that while they can be amazing, they can also lack in character development and lore, those two being sacrificed for big explosions and fights. 

I would love to get into these popular characters comics, but the universes are always so big and there are so many issues and I don’t know where to start (so I wouldn’t really start off with them, especially I wouldn’t start off with old comics), plus I can get so caught up in work and college that I couldn’t find the time to possibly get into something so big first.


What I would like to start off with is a character/universe that I can get attached to, one that wasn’t released too long ago (so it doesn’t have that many issues), and it doesn’t need to be a superhero. It can also be a normal folk type of person. I also don’t care that much about action. What I want is very good plotline and character development (the lore can be expansive or not, once again, I don’t really care, I just want to start off with something simple and if I really love it, I’ll get into the lore later on)



Thanks in advance and excuse my noob-ish way of treating this subject, I know that many of you are really passionate about comic books, but I am literally so clueless about this form of entertainment that I just don’t know where to start/how to start.

I got obsessed and fast forward to today, I have every Green Lantern (and adjacent) series since 2004. I'm a bit of an obsessive completionist so I'm trying to get for my collection every single Green Lantern ongoing, mini/maxi, and one shot, as well as any and all relevant team-up, crossover, or team book. I've compiled what I think is a pretty complete master list, but I am asking those of Reddit to look over it and help me out. I would be eternally grateful. I know it is missing basically all of the relevant Justice League and other team series, but I'm honestly not sure what is relevant.

264,"This essay is what the title says, and I don't want to turn this into another moral crusade post, so I'll stay up front this isn't about justifying piracy, I don't it can be 'justified' because it isn't a just act, and I think people who do pirate and seek comfort in that act should really just get over themselves, and accept the fact that they participate in a small harm.

That being said: what many comic creators and others are essentially stating in their arguments against pirating is the poor people should be functionally barred from participating in culture because they cannot afford it, which is essentially punishing people for living in poverty. They are not offering advice to better increase access to comic books in legal ways so that the poor can actually participate in culture, they are not offering ways in which the industry could eliminate piracy in a non-punitive way (and if you want to utilize the wholly broken criminal justice system to punish someone who stole a comic book--essentially ruining that persons life then you aren't as good of a person than you think you are), they are simply stating do not do this, I'm poor, I've been poor, and better than you. This isn't as a moral stance as many seem to think it is.

I've been actually poor, not 'man freelancing is tough, can't believe all the shit I have to put up with after graduating from art school and making comics, really rough out here' way, but 'I'm two days away from homelessness and absolute poverty, I'm starving, and I need a way out' way, and in a 'my parents can't afford to buy me anything to entertain me with, so I'll steal it, because being bored and poor is worse than being just poor' nihilistic way. During the second mentioned time I had virtually zero legal access to art outside of the library (which I frequented--but it wasn't the perfect solution, because of various issues I'm sure most people who dealt with libraries are familiar with). This is, in absolute terms, a societal moral failing, not on par of homelessness in seriousness, but of a similar (far lesser) failing. We all, in one way or another, participate in a system that both fetishizes the power of art, whilst also, at the same time, limiting access to it, either through monetary means (the comics industry problem), and through epistemic means (which also ties back into economic disparity, and class, but less of a problem for comics because that are designed to be working class art for working class people).

This is essentially the argument comic professionals are making--a deeply conservative one that both undermines the general value of art (its important and people *should*, as a right, have access to it), and really only punishes poor people through the regurgitation of conservative talking points. This is not a good argument, not for stopping piracy, nor from increasing the access to comics and art (and their own well being), it is simply supporting a terrible status quo for the benefit of the corporations they all work at.

So what can be changed? I'll state here I no longer read comics beyond a few books a year (House of X and Power of X being the big one this year) because I've been completely priced out of the hobby, and while I wished I could get down to the library more I can't reliably get there because of issues of transportation, time, and energy (poverty eats away at both of the last ones, and causes the first one). I don't torrent or download comics, which might surprise people here, given this essay. I just don't...participate in the culture anymore, beyond reading reviews and looking at previews because I can't afford it. But when I was younger I *did* still them, after I couldn't afford to keep up with the weekly price, or the bus fair it costed to get to the LCS so I stole it. This is the crux of the issue of piracy--framing it as a personal responsibility issues neither helps creators or gets rid of piracy. All it really does is create sites of justifications by pirates.

So once again, what can be changed? First we need to recognize that their are essentially two groups of pirates, those who will won't stop pirating, and really don't give a shit you call them bad or wrong or 'killing the industry', and functionally unreachable, and those who literally can't, because issues of poverty, or access, or geography, and so on. I think its a mistake to confuse one for the other because all you're doing to is turning the second into the first. With that out the way, what can be done about the second group? A number of things that are more suited for the betterment of the medium than telling them they are horrible people and are literally killing your children or some shit for downloading a infinitely replicated digital file. I'm going to offer a number of arguments that are more favourable for everyone from largest, in terms of scale, to the smallest.

1. A literal revolution that fundamentally changes the fabric of our society so that workers, including the pirates and the comic professionals, don't need to either submit to a work-place tyranny or starve to death, and provides basic standard of living for everyone so those who want to spend the effort and time on art can without worry about starving, and those who don't want to pay for it don't have to. This is will not happen in our life time, but its still a better argument than yelling at people on the internet either 'buy my book you actual filth!'.

2. Utilizing the current government system to better fund art, through public grants and other various methods that give artists a livelihood that isn't directly tied to how well a rigged economic system sells there books. I would also propose this only be tied to creator-owned books--corporations should provide a basic standard of living for all individuals they hire or they shouldn't exist. Again very unlikely.

3. A union--literally a union so that piracy doesn't effect the bottom line of comic professionals. I know most comic professionals, unfortunately, think like small business owners instead of workers, but unions have demonstrated to increase living standards across the board in a industry, even for those not apart of the union.

4. Destroy the direct market, make comics cheaper, and various other ways the industry itself can change to not only make comics more affordable, but make it more accessible, which in turn would help out creators. We see comics outside of the direct market flourish, be it manga, European comics, or YA graphic novels.

5. for creator-owned comics, utilize pay-as-you-want (which I've used in pass creative endeavors and surprisingly most people paid the price ceiling, and those who couldn't were incredibly grateful), or other pricing schemes (or start a patreon, or other crowdfunding (but not Kickstarter because they are deeply anti-union) source--supplement your income) that will help eliminate the second group of pirates.

6. lastly, do as you are now. Just yelling into the void of the internet.

If the goal is to destroy pirating, and I agree, it is, then there are much better ways than what is going on right now. No amount of moral grandstanding is going to end the problem, and I doubt anything ever will, *but* there are better solutions that just grandstanding.",Fucoui,"Poverty, access to art, and pirating.",1574841310,0,True,comicbooks,2019-11-27

272,"So, I'm curious how everyone else enjoys their comics. For me, personally, this is how I collect/read:

1) Current Titles - Floppies.  If it's a monthly title, and it's current, I go ahead and pre-order via [tfaw.com](https://tfaw.com)  , and I just read em month to month. I really prefer to read trades, BUT if its current, there's no way I wait 6 months each time. Even waiting a month is hard enough! The biggest issues with this is price, and that I have terrible memory, so by the time the next issue is out, I've forgotten what happened in the last issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) Non-current titles - Trades. This is my favorite way to read comics. I love the feel of trade paperbacks. I love that I can take them anywhere, read them on the couch, on the bed, at my computer, at work, etc. The price is great, especially since I order everything from [instocktrades.com](https://instocktrades.com) \- every trade is 40-60% off, no matter how new.   The biggest downside to trades for me is the GLUE. I live in Georgia - where it gets really hot. I've had the glue in 2 of my trade paperbacks melt on me now, just for leaving the trades in the car for over an hour. You really have to be careful with the glue in the trades, it WILL melt :(

&amp;#x200B;

3) My new method - DIGITAL! - So, I recently just got a Samsung Galaxy Tab from my work for free, compliments of my boss. I've always wanted to try digital, but I never had a tablet. I DO occasionally read comics on my computer, but who wants to really read comics on a computer, sitting up straight in a computer chair?

&amp;#x200B;

I have found that I LOVE reading em on the tablet. Especially the samsung galaxy tab. Its either 10"" or 11"", I forget, but it is the PERFECT size. The comic appears one page at a time, and its super easy to read and convenient. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

364,"Hello, fellow fans! 

Over the years, I've employed different methods for setting the mood right for reading comic books. Be it setting my phone to silent (or in the old days, leaving the phone of the hook), stocking up on snacks (works better now that I'm reading almost exclusively digital), getting in my favourite chair or just making sure I have no obligations left for the day. 

One thing that really sets the stage for me, and that I've employed more and more over time, is listening to music while reading. I found that movie soundtracks can often elevate the immersion and experience to a great degree. 

One of my favourite soundtracks to go with is the soundtrack to The Bourne Identity. It's both tense and beautiful. Works well for most action and suspense comics, like Batman. I recently rewatched the movie, and was struck with that I've come to associate the music with Batman... Another one, more bombastic, and perhaps better for event comics is the soundtrack for The Rock by Hans Zimmer. But it's a bit uneven (especially the ""Jade"" track in the middle of an otherwise pretty tense feel).

So, after noticing the hectic sale policy at Comixology, I've decided to track down the prices of comics on my ""to read"" list to see if I could see some patterns (duration of the sale, amount of time between the sales, etc...).

It makes we wonder if one day  Marvel and DC will give hard reboot to the main universe by giving a finale to the current one? Think about it old readers are about to decline,Some of them might pass away at any moment and the continuity begins to retcon too much that it might get  loosely connected to previous version of the continuity itself .

So perhaps if Marvel and DC might stay relevant to the current times ,They must do the risky move that is by ending the current continuity with a finale event and move on to a new universe with a hard reboot and probably end detective comics and action comics

478,"I am very stringent about the franchises that I enjoyed when I was a kid. Like, ""Terminator ended with *T2*"", ""*Alien 3* never happened"", ""*The Matrix* was a great solo movie"" - you know the type of guy. So consider me shocked when I read Verheiden's comics and really, really liked them.

If you have never heard about Mark Verheiden - he worked on *Superman* and *Phantom*, wrote the script for Jim Carrey's *The Mask*, created *Timecop* (comics, movie, and show), developed *Constantine* for NBC and *Daredevil* for Netflix. But back in 1987, he wasn't that big yet. In fact, Aliens was his second comic book after *The American* miniseries.

# Aliens: Outbreak, Nightmare Asylum, and Female War

[Aliens: Outbreak by Mark Verheiden and Willie Shubert](https://preview.redd.it/2b41dbx8lm141.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b9e7cbb736b55a58ef8df7856af88f359c32e74)

Verheiden was the first guy to write Aliens comic books - before him, we had only an adaptation of the original movie. And let's just say that he knocked it straight out of the park.

The story picks up with Newt and Hicks after the events of *Aliens*, because, of course, they didn't die! It's been a while, Newt is almost eighteen now, and both of them are still really fucked up after the events of the movie. Except that it's not over, and when the xenomorphs do come back, the Colonial Marines need someone experienced to lead the expedition...

The actual story is a lot more bombastic and throws our heroes all around the galaxy. Without spoiling things, it's very high-octane, gritty and fitting into the world of Cameron's movies. And yes, we do get the closure on Ripley in this alternate universe, and while it is somewhat fanservicey, I find that it works.

The books do not shy away from the PTSD both Newt and Hicks are experiencing. In fact, both of them are often barely holding on to the real world and don't turn into big damn heroes with Batgod plot armor. In fact, the book is mostly about failures and characters almost have to pay for theirs. 

The art in *Outbreak* is a classical four-color style common for the 80s, but Willie Shubert is a good enough artist to make it work. The two sequels have a little different more modern. They are not bad, but I find that I like the old-school designs of *Outbreak* better.

&amp;#x200B;

[Aliens: Nightmare Asylum by Mark Verhaiden and Denis Beauvais](https://preview.redd.it/f982d2i5mm141.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfeac94be0e7db9d34b84ba183a3b0daa22c8cec)

**DIFFERENT VERSIONS:** When *Alien 3* released, Dark Horse went into the Big Brain mode and tried to adapt the already released stories to the movie continuity. Newt became Billy, Hicks became Wilks, Ripley became a synthetic android clone of herself (it's really unclear) and the story turned into a horrible mess. Even the Aliens: Omnibus vol. 1 contains that version of the series and it's just bad.

However, the new [Aliens: The Essential Comics vol. 1](https://www.comixology.com/Aliens-The-Essential-Comics-Vol-1/digital-comic/69203) contains the original versions with slightly cleaned-up art. You do miss out on *Theory of Alien Propagation* (a pretty good lore-book on xenomorphs) but the upsides are worth it. 

**CONCLUSION:** It may be nostalgia talking, but I love these stories. They are a little campy and maybe not as dynamic as modern blockbusters, but god damn it, they are thrilling and fit this universe so damn well. It's a must-read for all *Aliens* fans.

**MY SCORE:** 8/10. Not bad, for a human.

# Predator: Concrete Jungle, Cold War and Dark River

[Predator: Concrete Jungle by Mark Verheiden, Ron Randall and Chris Warner](https://preview.redd.it/eas3dwhywm141.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c0602c011c7e7b08c28a53b5af251c3baf2f38)

With *Aliens: Outbreak* taken care off, Verheiden picked up another high-profile franchise from 20th Century Fox. *Predator: Concrete Jungle* came out in 1989, almost a year before *Predator 2*. It also does the whole *Predator in the Big City* much better than the second movie.

Our hero is detective Detective Schaefer. OK, his name is not ""Detective"", it's just all everyone ever calls him. Originally, the character was supposed to be Dutch, now working for the NYPD, but something fell through and comicbook Schaefer became Dutch's older brother.

The brave detective Detective is investigating the gang war in NYC and trying to figure out what happened to Dutch in , when an alien (or, to be exact, a predator) drops in the middle of it all and paints the town red. Thus begins the worldwide journey that will take Detective to Russia and Guatemala, looking for his brother and trying to understand what happened to him.

The comic is brutal, dynamic and moves really fast. On the downside, it's not as cerebral as the movie, with Predators being more in-line with their later appearances than the *Monsters in the Shady Wood*.

Most issues are pencilled by Ron Randall, with Chris Warner doing some art in *Concrete Jungle*. It's old-school and overall pretty good. Dark River has much smoother coloring, which actually kinda works too, even if I'd rather the trilogy had a more uniform artstyle.

&amp;#x200B;

[Predator: Dark War by Verheiden and Ron Randall](https://preview.redd.it/e0mnxmc5ym141.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84bc63ca20763a1a1987f5c6f0788ff7ca72a456)

There are a lot of ways to collect this series, including the recent [Predator: The Essential Comics vol. 1](https://www.comixology.com/Predator-The-Essential-Comics-Vol-1/digital-comic/692102). But really, anything will do - neither the art or the script changed in the re-releases.

**CONCLUSION:** It's good, even if not completely great. However, it's above and beyond the rest of the *Predators* franchise, aside from the first movie. And it's really, really fun if you enjoy brutal action movies from the 80s. It probably won't pass the Bechdel test, and it's not all that politically correct, but it's still really good.

**MY SCORE:** 7/10. This stuff will make you a god damned sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me.",AreYouOKAni,"[Review] ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" series by Mark Verheiden. TL;DR: Go read them, they are awesome.",1575038378,9,True,comicbooks,2019-11-29

One would think that DC hired mercenaries to beat Hong Kong protesters when all they did was delete one picture from Instagram following criticism from chinese fans. It's no different from removing Rafael Albuquerque's Batgirl cover or Marvel basically curting relations with Manara after the Spider-Woman cover. In fact, it's lesser than those, because the art isn't actually being pulled from the book, all that happened is that one Instagram post was removed.

The biggest force in pop-culture today, the MCU, makes sure to never include in any of their movies topics that could bother the Chinese government, make scenes exclusive to the chinese market, and even bend the ethnicity of Tibetan characters to deny their existence.

* In July, I [checked in](https://sktchd.com/longform/plusses-and-minuses-the-story-so-far-for-comic-book-retail-in-2019/) with a bunch of comic retailers to get insight on how the year was going, what was working, what wasn't, and more to take the temperature of comic shops from around the world
* I talked with everyone involved with Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. (besides Warren Ellis, who I picked up quotes from elsewhere) to [build a feature](https://sktchd.com/longform/living-in-the-shadow-of-nextwave-a-look-at-the-making-and-magic-of-a-comic-book-cult-classic/) about why that comic rules, how it came together, and why it has never come back
* Libraries are one of the quiet giants of the comic industry, and I [explored their impact](https://sktchd.com/longform/the-quiet-giant/) and how they do that with insight from people from publishers, the American Library Association and more (this one is always open too)
* There's a problem holding back the direct market right now that no one is talking about. This [feature](https://sktchd.com/longform/a-matter-of-risk/) digs into what it is. (It's risk aversion. It's a big problem.)
* Lastly, for Marvel's 80th anniversary, I read 35 years of Marvel comics to [figure out](https://sktchd.com/longform/the-contest-of-champions-marvel/) which comic won the year for every year of my life. It was a lot, but it was fun and a good discussion piece.

I've also written deep dive sales examinations, a big look at where Image Comics is post-The Walking Dead with sales charts + insight from Image's Eric Stephenson, a massive feature on how DC's Wednesday Comics anthology came together, art features with a bunch of comics, a piece where I [looked back](https://sktchd.com/column/revisitor-hellboys-pancakes/) on Hellboy's Pancakes with Mike Mignola's perspective, and a lot more.

It's a monthly series that focuses on a group of people sucked into a fantasy realm and into their fantasy avatars, first as teens and then again as adults. I thought this was a cool idea and I gave it a shot, even though I'm not really a fantasy guy. Though, if I'm honest, I do read fantasy like all the time.

The reason for this specific post is because literally right now I'm watching The Dragon Prince on Netflix (This is also good -- reminds me of Avatar: The Last Airbender) and I appreciate how elves are hated rather than immortal, beautiful, enviable beings. God I hate elves.

176,"Earlier,I talked about about hard reboot that will put an end to both DC and marvel long running convoluted continuity with an ending and replace it with a hard reboot filled with reimagining  of the characters and original ones every once once in  5-6 years with a fresh continuity from beginning to end .However not many people are invested and interested  with the  idea for various reasons

&amp;#x200B;

* Many people think that it will cause lazy creativity which I thought might give artists and writers more freedom to create their own take of their own dc and marvel universe with a beginning to end or at least with a showrunner  
* Many people are invested in the characters and the long running continuity,removing that will make everything wasted and felt that they are doing this for nothing 
* Both marvel and Dc still use the current continuity and characters without end for their profit especially that they are considered as their crash
* It was believed that this idea would make the comic book sales much worse resulting in another comic book crash
* And lastly many people prefer  huge continuities and back stories in both DC and Marvel main comics rather than stories with a beginning to end

But what happens if DC and marvel decided to do a hard reboot anyway but becomes a success?

If it does,here what happens

* Many people will still think that this idea is controversial but later understood that its a good idea as the old ones will live on as mascots and continue as standalone and non-canon stories as second imprint ,While the main line will only consist of hard reboot continuity with a beginning to end 
* A mixture of old and new versions of the characters in both Dc and marvel will appear in crossovers for an anniversary special (but non canon or semi canon) to celebrate the company success ,evolution and history
* Both new and old version of the DC and marvel characters in different continuities will appear in video games
* Books made by marvel and DC aimed for kids will still start the old version of the DC and marvel characters wince they are the mascots of the company 
* And lastly there will be film or television adaptation adapting each continuity of the DC and marvel universe from beginning to end

So if I belive that the hard reboot of Dc and marvel is a success then such things that I explain will likely happen",trover2345325,My perspective on what happens if the hard reboot in both DC and marvel main universe will be a success in the comic book industry,1574259422,19,True,comicbooks,2019-11-20

234,"I'm a life long comic fan but this sub-genre has always been my favorite. Realistic depictions of super hero comics. i.e. realistic takes on powers and/or motivations. I don't even know if it has a name. I'd like to read more of it, so I created a list in hopes I can attract other people who like this genre and to contribute their own examples.

&amp;#x200B;

*  [Black Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hood#Greg_Hettinger)  \- The best take I've ever encountered. Realistic power set and motivation. It's like they deconstructed ""what would it take to make someone believably wear a mask and beat up criminals?"" and filled in any potential plot holes.
* [A God Somewhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_God_Somewhere) \- A guy gets Superman level powers and how does the world respond to it.
* [Supreme Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squadron_Supreme#Supreme_Power) \- Takes the classic DC hero tropes and puts a more logical approach to how they'd interact (superman tentatively working with government, Flash gets endorsements, Batman only protects black people, Green Lantern is insanely dedicated special forces soldier)
* [new universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Universe) \- The comics that got me interested in this genre. They recreated the main concepts of Marvel's characters (PSI-Force are the X-Men, D.P.7 is ostensibly an Avengers, etc.) but with realistic consequences and power usage. I.e. the guy with super speed has to count to ten between each word, super strength is proportional to size.
* [Watchmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen) \- Definitely encapsulates this sub-genre perfectly
* [Unbreakable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_(film)) \- While a movie, it captures this genre perfectly. Split and Glass being continuations. 
* [Rising Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Stars_(comics)) \- This series more or less hits the right notes, introducing 113 people with powers and how the world reacts.
* [Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_(comics)) \- The power depiction isn't realistic, but like Watchmen describes living in a world with superheroes. Having the focus be two beat cops having to deal with it.
* [Kick-Ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-Ass_(character)) \- Over the top but a realistic take on superheroes and motivations. Kick-Ass 2's realistic superhero team up was a definite high point for me.",Buttflesh69,Realistic Superhero Depictions,1574296976,23,True,comicbooks,2019-11-20

We got many amazing responses, and I still frequently think back fondly on that thread.

Seeing as how tastes change, new comics come out weekly, and a community's userbase shifts and grows, we want to ask you all again:

What is your *favorite* comic book, and why?

While we know it can be difficult, please choose one book that is very near and dear to you. Honorable mentions are fine, of course, but what we're hoping for is an explanation. Use this as an opportunity to convince other people to read your favorite comic!

- One comic book per person, please. Feel free to talk about your favorite book even if someone else mentioned the same book. We want to hear your own take on why the comic is special to you.

- It doesn't matter if it's a whole run, an OGN, a one-shot, manga, etc.—if it's a comic, it counts! Just include issue numbers, volume, arc title, etc. when applicable so people can know exactly which comic or run you're talking about.

- Please also include the creative team to the best of your knowledge.

- Discussion is encouraged, and as always, don't insult anyone because of their chosen favorite comic.

- Feel free to continue contributing to this post, even after it's no longer stickied.

Wow, from this clip, it's almost as if the so called ""Snyder Cut"" is an entirely different movie in terms of action sequences at least.

You can see Cyborg, Diana and Arthur teaming up against Steppenwolf and Cyborg using 4 arms (the extra set of arms are being enacted by another stuntman behind) and Steppenwolf still beating them.

You can also see Superman joining the fight and Steppenwolf dragging Superman by his cape in one instance.

You can see Zeus or maybe Flash blasting through multiple enemies in a line with lightning and lots of other exciting moments.

The action sequences look slick, fast and brutal with people getting speared through their necks and stuff. Looks like we did miss a lot. I mean Snyder's reputation with action sequences still stands firm.

I'm working on an informal survey about the portrayal of autism across various platforms of media and how people feel about them (ie whether they think a certain piece of media represents it well). At the moment I'm compiling lists of titles with autistic characters and one area I'm lacking in is comics. Thusfar I've found [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autistic_fictional_characters) on Wikipedia with 5 titles and [this article](https://the-art-of-autism.com/face-value-comic-series-entertains-while-educating-about-autism-and-bullying/) on another title, [this listicle](https://103gbfrocks.com/5-comic-book-characters-on-the-autism-spectrum/), and [this other article with one more title](https://geekclubbooks.com/autistic-hero-comics/). Copying from there, they are:

Reed Richards (Fantastic Four)

Black Manta (Aquaman)

Johnny Do (Psi-Force)

Hikaru Azuma (With the Light: Raising an Autistic Child), manga

Mark Shiffron (Postal)

Michael and Myra (Face Value Comics)

Billy Cranston (Power Rangers), movie(?)

David Haller (Legion), tv version(?)

JMan (Mighty League Autism), webcomic

From what I can tell for Reed Richards it's moreso been skirted that he *might* be autistic but it hasn't actually been confirmed, though for the purposes of my survey he's going to be included. David Haller's spot in the relevant listicle mainly talks about him having DID and [this other discussion I found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ALegion_(Marvel_Comics)) discusses the possibility of terminology mixup so I'm not sure whether he should be included or not?

When I was searching the sub for anything to do with autistic characters I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/vjmxx/an_autistic_superhero_brothers_with_autism_create/) but the linked article seems to have been deleted and when I search ""autistic superhero"" I just get a lot of tacky ""autism is my superpower"" merch. If anyone knows what that comic was called that info would be super useful!

422,"I think it's about time I quit comic books in general. Why? It's simple. 

Majority of comics out there don't even try to use all the creative tools that using both visuals and written word give them. For example, if more comics were like Sandman Overture in the way the art tells as compelling a narrative as the rest of the book as well as fits with the narrative and serves as a new level of understanding for how the story should be interpreted, then I'd read more. But I keep getting disappointed by comic books consistently. I just picked up Brave New World by Adlous Huxley and I'm realizing that most comic books are picture books. They don't use visuals to show the under lying characteristics of characters most of the time, and the art is often film inspired retreads even though comic books don't have the audio-visual atmosphere of movies because they are comics. Most comics don't even challenge your mind on implications and emotional depth. 

Another problem I've always had was Super heroes. Like how many super hero books do there have to be? There are big action franchises out there, don't get it twisted; But for comics the two giants of the industry cater to only that audience. A lot of indie comics are good, but also fall into the ""lack of art that actually helps tell the story in a unique way"" category often (Looking at you, SAGA.) 

Maybe I'll pick up a few graphic novels once or twice, but from now on, I'm back to being a book lover because at least I can find books that actually are complex, use their words to create atmosphere  beyond the surface level, and actually give an emotional response.

I've been reading comics since I was 8 years old, and it's been over 10 years and I'm only now realizing half the shit I've read isn't even half s good as reading The Phantom of the Opera or The Storyteller by Jodi Picoult.

I would love it if you guys could help me figure out a reading order for Miles Morales' Spiderman post-Secret Wars. I know there are guides out there already that I could follow, but that's exactly where my problem stems from: I took look at Comicbook Herald's guide to see if it was anything good, and I believe it is, except for some parts I've found at conflict with some of the official Marvel Guides. For example, [CH's guide](https://www.comicbookherald.com/miles-morales-spider-man-reading-order/) says to read Civil-War II 0-8 before continuing on with Spider-Man #6, which is opposite to [Marvel's own take](https://marvelguides.com/part-6-civil-war-ii) on how Civil War II should be read.

Not to mention that CH's [guide](https://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-marvel-reading-order-guide/civil-war-2/) on Civil War II is not the same as Marvel's, and it's really making me confused.

486,"Now I was originally gonna post this on a subreddit that was dedicated to Superheroes but the sub was pretty much dead.

Also this is not to convert you into liking a certain type of hero but rather to understand their importance.

So I'm pretty sure that people here at this subreddit love superheroes. Comics are the home of Superheroes. We have gotten many superheroes that have affected our culture over the years like Superman, Spider-Man, and Batman. You have most likely heard many scholars talk about how superheroes are our modern American mythologies, and I couldn't agree more. 

But lately we have been getting a surge of a certain kind of hero and have seen a decline of another certain type of hero. Now there are many sub archetypes but I am only going to be talking about the two main types of heroes, and those two types of heroes are the Aspirational and the Motivational hero. Let's establish what those heroes are.

The aspirational heroes are heroes who don't need a  multi-layered reason as to why they became a hero, they become a hero because it's simply the right thing to do. They don't have moral failings nor do they or should question their aspirations. This type of hero is obviously in line with heroes such as Superman, and Captain America. People usually say how the aspirational heroes are unrelatable but the thing they aren't supposed to be relatable they can be relatable but what is more important is whether they are inspiring.

The motivational heroes are heroes that have a multi layered reason to become a hero. Like for example Spider-Man who became Spider man after watching his uncle Ben die because he failed to take action and do the right thing. These characters have flaws and mess up from time to time.

We have been getting more and more motivational heroes than we have been getting aspirational heroes, and the aspirational heroes like Superman, and Captain America have been deconstructed to be more of a motivational hero. The thing is that we need aspirational heroes as much as we need motivational heroes, because aspirational heroes are their to set the standard of what is truly good. Spider-Man needs Captain America to aspire to be that good, without the aspirational heroes the motivational heroes are basically lost in what they are striving for because they don't have a standard to aspire to. Don't get me wrong we need motivational heroes to show us that it is okay to fail, and that even though we fail that we must never give up what we are aspiring to do.

So that is the importance of aspirational heroes, they are there to set the moral standard for motivational heroes. I want to know what you guys think?",dracosadra723,The importance of Aspirational heroes.,1574518087,11,True,comicbooks,2019-11-23

527,"I just finished vol. 3 of TK’s run and then read Tynion IV’s mission statement on his take of Batman after King is done. With King I was confused as to why he dealt with Bruce’s love life, his happiness, and alternate version of his father. While I am just working through his run, the mission statement rang an idea in my head. That King wanted to make changes that would stick. In hindsight, having Catwoman be a runaway bride and come back makes it so the marriage will stick. Readers are not going to sit though Kyle running away from Wayne again and pulling a “Brand New Day” situation. As Tynion IV said that Bruce is no longer the playboy, but with Selena. That would be great as a solid change to Batman. I have yet to read into flashpoint Batman, but from what little I’ve read, it allows Bruce to deal with his issues surrounding his father and get past them. Though, only speculation, but it would be great if that part of Batman was dealt with. So the character can deal with other issues, like his son, or a new child.

I think only actual speedsters, and cosmic-aware reality manipulators would be safe, it's kinda ridiculous if you think about it, kinda breaks all his stories too, cause you have to have him ""holding off"" to explain why he doesn't punch a hole through everyone in one mili-second, plus the fact that no one should be able to even touch him even if they were strong enough to do damage, and I know there are guys that have crazy speeds when traveling like Thor but I don't think most of those do the speedster style thing were they just move freely and time ""stops""...

52,"So, a lot of people I know really hate Superman. He isn't my favorite comic book character, not even in my top 10, but I never disliked him. I actually find his part in huge events to be my favorite parts. Like in DCeased. I loved him in DCeased.

But, so many people I know just can't stand him. They usually can't stand him for these reasons.

1. They say he is too OP.

2. They say he is too happy and cheery.

3. They say he is boring.

So, as a fun little thing, I would like to say why these are wrong. Not saying you have to like the character by any means, but I have always found these arguments to not be good. I know a lot of comic characters that I don't really like that others love because I just have no interest in them.

Let's begin.

1. Superman isn't that OP. He is when you compare him to other heroes but any hero can be OP given certain comparisons. People act like Superman only fights giant robots or car thieves. But he isn't. A lot of the people Superman fight either have kryptonite, or something along those lines that'll weaken him, or they can use magic, which also weakens him. Plus, I always found this argument weird anyway. Every hero beats probably 99% of their villains. If you random pick up a Green Arrow comic or Spider-Man comic, do you really think their is a possibility of him dying? No! Heroes don't really have a chance of dying unless they make it a big event. It's at least on the cover if not also in the name of that issue. Plus, it's not really ever about, for pretty much any character, of if they win, but how they win. Same applies to Superman. On top of all of that, Superman might not be easily killed, but that doesn't mean he can't still lose. He may beat the villain, but what if the villain wipes out all of Metropolis? 

2. They're plenty of comics where Superman is more serious and dark. But what makes Superman, Superman is his hope. He inspires hope. Even when he is scared. Even when he is worried or upset. He inspires everyone around him to keep fighting. But Clark Kent as plenty of moments in comics where he feels more human and like a regular person, and I, personally, like him being more happy. DC likes to have a lot of darker and sadder heroes. Superman being happy makes for a good contrast. Same reason I like the Titans, Teen Titans, Young Justice, some Flash stuff. Same reason I like Spider-Man in Marvel. They are just fun characters.

3. Alright. Call the comics lame, call him a boy scout, say whatever, but boring? That just makes it seem like you aren't that invested in the world of DC. A lot of the battles Superman gets in involves the entire city or the fate of the whole world. They are hardly boring. Hell, even one of my favorite comic series I could understand someone calling boring because it seems like it is 90% dialogue (Rebirth Deathstroke), but most Superman comics I can't really seem to call boring. Maybe I am just picking up the really good ones. I don't know, but I have yet to read one and be like, ""Could have not bought this.""",jordan999fire,[Discussion] I never understood people's dislike of Superman,1573610255,63,True,comicbooks,2019-11-12

I've been reading some DC trades like Batman: Metal and some Black Label stuff, but I'd like to know where to start with Marvel. Last thing I really read was Secret Wars, if that helps.

63,"I see this criticism pop up a fair amount (usually regarding a new writer) on books with long running continuity. It feels like shorthand for a few things: not feeling like the tone, or character dialogue, or plot, themes, etc. match what’s expected. 

That makes me wonder where people find that expected version (or versions) of comic characters. Is it:  
\- your first exposure to the character  
\- the first significant appearance of the character  
\- a/the defining story/run   
\- your personal favorite story that character has been in  
\- etc.

I get that nothing is really as clear cut as just picking one of these, and that the answer is personal and might change from character to character, but curious to get as many opinions as possible. Where do you get that definitive understanding of a character that can trigger the feeling that a creative team doesn't understand them?

I'm downsizing and trying to get rid of non-essentials around the house.  I collected a variety of comics between \~2010 - 2014 or so.  I hopped into Walking Dead a bit too late, but I was around the new 52, some Marvel reboot stuff, and non-traditional stuff which turned out to be my favorite in Unwritten (best series ever), Fables, Saga, Chew, etc.

Anyhow, I have at least Snyder's Batman 1 - 5, and I might have more I'll need to dig through.  I also have issues 1 - 40 of Saga.  I believe those are the most prized of what I have.

For the most part, I read each issue carefully and put them into a bag w/ board immediately, then into a pullbox.  A couple issues I might have had my fiancee or friend read once, but that's it.  From my novice eyes everything is in terrific condition.

Is any of this stuff desired within the /r/comicbooks community?  I tried taking by a LCS but they offered $100 for all \~3.5 of my pullboxes and it didn't seem right.

The nature of Diana's true parentage wasn't just some gimmick; it set up a clearly well thought out mixing of family and Greek mythology, whilst developing Diana's character and relationships with her friends and family at the same time.

It's like a mini epic. I just can't get over it. I know people said it was one of the highlights of the New 52, but damn. Even the Zero Year and Villain Month issues tied in perfectly. In fact, without them, the run would suffer.

I'd like to display the floppies alongside the trades on a shelf, as of they were collected editions like trades with the name of the story arc on the spine and what have you.

So far I've only found 3 ways of doing this reallyj

Use some kind of file, but ones normally for A4 are to big to collect single story arcs, mini or maxi series of between 5 and 12 issues and the files made specifically for comics (BCW Stor-folio's) would be ideal, but are about £16 each!

Custom bind books, which is too expensive to have done, and DIY binding is time consuming and a little risky.

Put multiple books in 1 bag, and create a custom spine to slide in the bag with them. I've been doing this and it's fun designing the spines and all, but bags can only hold 5-6 comics max.

Does anyone have any alternative methods they use? I've also thought of trying to sell sorry arcs and mini/maxi series on eBay and then buying the collected editions instead, but I'd rather not. Thanks

Some of these characters are kind of fundamentally different from their Watchmen counterparts like Nightshades backstory or Peacemakers alliegance to Peace and the like.  Can't really see Ted ever turning out like Nite Owl (I mean he got fat but he never really lost that knack for adventure).

So apart from characters being somewhat different, there is also the point of continuity and if that would have been folded into Watchmen.  Could Alan Moore had approached the book differently if he could have used these characters?

The stress of her son's lifestyle might have caused his mother's death, his cockiness frequently gets him into trouble in combat, and he has enough inner demons he was specifically chosen by Parallax as the right soul to corrupt, which despite his ample willpower he never resisted because he was too cocky to even think something was wrong (a viewpoint which is specifically mentioned in Green Lantern Rebirth).

514," James is a fine writer and Tony is an amazing artist, but I'm guessing they're only the provisional creative team, Batman always needs a superstar writer behind it, so here's my pitch: Brian Bendis and Alex Maleev on a 24 issue run, it would be killer and look great, full blown noir since The Batman is coming up soon.

You can always do great action pieces but with an overall Batman mystery on it. If readers hate it you can always prep the next team on year two, I'm saying 24 issues because that's the contract minimum Bendis would take for something that big.

41,"
Earlier this year ""No One Left To Fight!"" subtitled ""the comic you always wanted"".

By writer Aubrey Sitterson and Artist Fico Ossio was released.

My first thought was, this Dragon Ball Z fan fiction and that  Aubrey probably wished that Goku and Bullma had hooked up at the end of end of Dragon Ball.

Hell, Aubrey basically said that's what the comic is, though he did so with more eloquent and likely to provoke a copyright suite language.

However there is more to it than that.

Be for we go any further, let me say this NOLTF is good Fan Fic.

The comic does something that the the Shounen battle manga rarely if ever do, ask what happens after the final epic battle is over?

The standard Heroic Narrative and the less well known [Heroinic Narrative](https://www.writersstore.com/the-virgins-promise-a-new-archetypal-structure/), are about maturatio, growing up.

The Hero is a figurative and in the case of coming of age stories, a literal child. They are transformed by their experiences into a fully functional Adult.

Okay, so where's the story about how to Adult, the Post Heroes Journey?

That's normally dealt with as a sequel...

* The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions.

* Captain America Winter Soldier.

* Kung Fu Panda 2.

So where's the story about getting old, looking back upon the battles fought,choices made having and to deal with the consequences of those choices, as well as preparing the next generation?

Those sorts of tales are much rare, or least i haven't come across them. 

No one Left to Fight, is that third story. The Heroes killed the big bad, have put their adventures behind them, and settled down.

There is quite literally, NO ONE LEFT TO FIGHT! 

Timor our Blue haired Vegeta/krilin analog actually has kids, and Vale our scarlet headed Goku analog while childless for reasons that I shant spoil, is given the offer by his former master to help train the next generation of mystical martial artists.

I accidentally sold the comic to someone in store, my saying that NOLTF is the cast of DBZ dealing a mid life crises.

* Maybe I have a future in sales?

My flippant but factual statement is a good shorthand for the series.

In some ways NOLTF's tag line is completely true for me, because it's something that I did want to see.

The high energy and unabashed fantasticality that defines what people tend to think of when they here the word Anime.

Filtered through the a western lens, in particular the grit and maturity.

I would kill for Joe Abercrombie to be given the licence to write original stories in the Blazblue setting. Beneath all the bright colorful characters that go ""hi-y"" as they battle across the screen; Is a very dark and rich setting.

While NOLTF isn't that dream made manifest, it is that idea.

No One Left To Fight, isn't merely Dragon Ball Z fan fiction. 

It's Dragon Ball would have been if the idea had come to a western comic writer  back in the[ 80s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-vpfEY0sl8).

The Fifth and final issue of this arc was released and spoilers!

It started with a fascination with his awesome powers but I began to relate more and more to this tortured genius, though lauded as perhaps the most creative genius in the MU he is the forgotten Avenger, the much despised hero.

He has a passion, curiosity, and sense of duty that could rival Richards, Parker, and anyone else.

Unfortunately Hank Pym has been one of the most ill-treated major characters in comic history. His only solo ongoing has been Tales to Astonish. He almost had an Ant Man ongoing in 2003 under MAX but it was cancelled prior to first issue while Scott Lang gets to be the first Ant man with an ongoing. In recent years it's seemed writers have tried to sweep Pym under the rug of Avengers history, his status as a founding Avenger seemingly lost upon most people or uncomfortably pushed to side by others.

I had long since accepted that to get my Pym fix I would have to be patient, and grateful for what I got. I'm happy I received the fatherly teacher from Avengers Academy, the leader in Avengers AI, and occasionally a true Avenger in the crossovers and events that have included him. When the rumors of an Ant man movie were first beginning to rumble, I was ecstatic to think that Pym would get to be on screen, and as the MCU kicked off, I held onto the fragile hope that he would get his due and be a founding Avenger on the silver screen. Instead we get Hawkeye and Black Widow. What's more it seemed that Edgar Wright had decided that the second Ant man would be the one to be in the movies, while Pym is relegated to being an aging figure with his glory days far behind him. To add salt to the wound, the great Tony Stark is now the creator of Ultron in the MCU with not even a hint towards his true origin, traded for a little more spotlight on Iron Man.

The OGN Rage of Ultron was an excellent read, a well put together story, with an immense focus on Pym's demons. As a Pym fan, I couldn't have asked for a better story... that is until the way it ended. I can't help but think, this is Marvel's way of handling the Pym problem. Get him out of the picture and allow Lang to supplant the Ant-man legacy, all for the sake of the MCU. Hell post Secret Wars we may find out that it was actually Tony who headed the Ultron project, while Pym acted as his lab assistant (if that).

The point of this rant is that I'm just kind of frustrated over the treatment of a character I really enjoy. I'm a fan, I have little to no say over what writers choose to do with these characters, but I can't help but feel angry over a character that I've grown particularly attached to. I fear for the future of Hank Pym. Though certainly nothing in comics is forever, I feel as though a certain damage has been done to the potential of this hero. I've long since given up the battle of explaining to friends who are movie-goers, or people new to comics, who the ""real ant man is"", who the ""real inventor of Ultron is"", who this forgotten Avenger is.

Who knows, maybe RoU is just a sign of good Pym stories to come, but as a fan of this harrowed hero, I've learned to be skeptical. In any all cases, Hank Pym is a hero, and he is the Avenger I will always feel the greatest connection to despite all else.",Donna201299,The Future of Hank Pym in the Marvel Universe,1573089164,9,True,comicbooks,2019-11-06

65,"It's always the same bullshit with these YouTube channels. They are always bitching and being negative about everything that comes out these days. Look, I don't like bad comics or unnecessary political shoe horns or propaganda either but holy shit dude...these guys literally see something that is ""SJW"" or ""woke"" in every speech bubble of every new comic that hits the stands.

They are never happy or satisfied with everything. Not every comic is going to be a groundbreaking, industry changing title. For fuck's sake, just learn to enjoy a comic book again. Yes, the old stuff from the 70's, 80's, and 90's is the best. Yes, most of those stories are very memorable and more iconic than what we have today. They defined lots of characters that we know and love. That being said, some of these guys need to get over themselves and realize that it's 2019 and things aren't going to be the same.

This is a new generation and therefore we have new writers, stories, and ideas. These comicsgate fucks just can't seem to accept that. Look, there will always be forgettable comics and stories that won't really make an impact, and that's how its always been. I'm not saying we need to accept mediocrity but it seems comicsgate people don't ever give anything a chance. They judge right off the bat and then proceed to crap on whatever storyline or writer until the end of time.

Ever since House of X/Powers of X came out and finished I have just gotten fed up with how ridiculous and ignorant people are with new comics. Compared to the last few years of X-Men books, Hickman's stuff was such a nice breath of fresh air after a lot of FORGETTABLE and boring books. Love it or hate it, Hickman has X-Men fans buzzing and talking about what is to come, what will happen, etc. Basically making people excited and thinking about the mutants again.

Meanwhile these comicsgate channels just continue to pump out video after video of themselves 'criticizing' a comic book and their circlejerk, echo-chamber viewers leave all of the same comments over and over and repeat about how the industry is dead, Marvel and DC are done, comics are infested by SJWs and woke culture, blah blah blah FUCKING blah. Why don't you actually go out and read these books instead of letting some schmuck on YouTube decide your uninformed opinion for you.

Finally, I love how all of these comicsgate people never want to review or discuss the new, good comics out there nearly as much as they want to shit on the same crappy or woke Marvel/DC book over and OVER again. Stop giving the bad books publicity (as well as your damn money) and give attention to the writers/artists/stories that are actually fun to read! I never see anyone talking about the new Red Sonja or Vampirells books from Dynamite. A bunch of comicsgate channels on YouTube only made videos about Vampirella because her new author Christopher Priest was attacked by some SJW journalist...once the first book came out they all stopped talking about it completely because they got their clicks from their anti-SJW woke journalist soy boy crowd.

What a fucking joke. Sorry for this long ass rant but man...comicsgate people can be so annoying and negative. They ruin comics sometimes.

- Will read Morrison's 12 issue Green Lantern and 3 part follow up. Does he plan to write any further DC cosmic ? Jurgen's Lantern writing didn't really impress me, will skip his work.

- As far as Superman and AC goes, I'll just read the trades maybe in a year or 2.. Bendis does write for the trade after all. The issue to issue reading that I did early on was frustrating as the plot moved along too slow.

- Justice League, I'll have a read of Snyder's.. are the other JL books any good ?

89,"Superman giving up his secret identity is only logical for a character who stands for truth and justice. It can't be ""Truth (except for the truth of his identity) and Justice..."", because Superman isn't a liar. He doesn't hide things from people. That's not who he is.

And so far I've seen only two consistent arguments against Brian Bendis having Superman reveal his identity to the DC universe:

The first is that it's been done before and never sticks... Okay, sure, this has happened in the past, even the recent past, but that doesn't mean it can't be a meaningful story today. And if you're quick to compare what Bendis is about to do to what another writer did five or ten or twenty years ago, just remember *those* guys were recycling the idea as well. But that's okay. What matters is how the story works for today, and whether there's a chance of something new coming in the aftermath. And if you think there's not going to be something new and surprising after this reveal, you simply selling Bendis short.

The second argument is that Superman ""needs"" the Clark Kent identity to protect the people he loves.... Why? In 2019 Jonathan Kent is a young man who can very much take care of himself. Lois Lane is considered one of the most dangerous women in the DCU, even without Superman to protect her. Who else does Superman have to shelter by being Clark? Ma and Pa are long dead. Jimmy Olsen is so clumsy he's somehow danger proof. It can't be a question of logic, because logic falls apart when you remember Superman's civilian disguise is literally a pair of glasses. If you think logically about that gimmick it just seems silly, albeit in a charming way that most people love regardless of whether it makes sense.

So, why else does Superman need to hide? Why should he continue living as a constant contradiction of his own moral code? Look, I love Clark Kent as much as the next fan, but maybe it's time to set that gimmick aside and let Kal-El be the most super version of himself: one with nothing to hide.",Jake_CouldBeComics,"Where Superman is concerned, ""Truth and Justice"" shouldn't come with an asterisk.",1573139565,13,True,comicbooks,2019-11-07

This situation reminded me of a quote plastered in 100's of Instagram bios, Facebook posts and Pinterest boards, ""Oh darling but what if you fly"". This quote is attributed to a poem written by Erin Hanson, who wrote this poem well after Neil Gaiman published the Sandman series in the 1990s. 

My intention with this is not to induce a witch hunt or condemnation of a poet who possibly plagiarized or reinterpreted intellectual property, but rather to express my frustration and get some others opinions on it. 

It angers me that in order for this quote to reach a wider audience, it's emotional weight and creative power was condensed into a merchandisable bite-sized chunk. I understand that situations like this are miles outside of my control, but I would love to hear what you all think about it.

178,"Greetings,

Im thinking of getting into the Buffy / Angel comic books as well as some older Vertigo titles, i could not however find information on the payment that the original creators receive for current reprints and digital sales.

I've read the blog entry from Mark Waid about the contracts used by DC and Marvel and general stuff about payment distribution between publishers and writers for written books, including ebook sales,where normal distributions are often used such as 10-15% for the writer, and discounted sales by physical stores, where usually the writers payment is more adjusted than the publishers.  


So do you have information about the following?:

\- Are adaptation titles from Dark Horse and BOOM! creator owned or are they more akin to hire-for-work contracts?

\-  Since the Dark Horse Angel and Buffy comics will now only be sold by BOOM! in their new ""Legacy"" Editions, will their original creators receive anything from those? If not, i probably wont be bothered to buy them.

\- As far as is understand, the Creators of Vertigo Titles receive only small amounts on i.e. Hellblazer reprints (btw, will they continue after Vertigo is closed?) and such, do they receive the same percentage on comixology?

\-And how are the percentages affected by 5$ sales on Comixology, which would be the only price point for me to consider buying them digitally.

   From a mathematical standpoint, would they receive more if am to buy 20 TPBs for each 5 Euro on sales (where i assume that mostly the royaltys are cut, not the publishers amount), or if i were to buy 100 euros worth of physical full priced trades, and acquire the remaining ones through other means?

\- And do Artists / drawers in Vertigo / Image etc. titles receive any royaltys or only the write?",Ceress_Sedai,"Royalty Payments and Creator Ownership in Dark Horse, BOOM! and Vertigo",1573209542,3,True,comicbooks,2019-11-08

Box, office, etc. Essentially just open an app, pick what titled you want, and it would ship out that Wednesday and it would keep shipping until it got cancelled or you no longer wanted it. 

I’ve already looked into ensuring the books won’t be damaged in transit. Obviously things change as scale goes up, but as it stands currently I have options to send out books without worry. 

I wouldn’t want this to take over comicbook shops, but for some people, like myself, don’t have the time to go to a shop right at Wednesday anymore. Or some people don’t have any decent shops near them, or have shops that don’t do subscriptions. And my goal would be to out to reach them. 

Also, I’m sorry about the shameless self-promotion on this. The people who will help me get funding on this wanted me to round out my bases and do any and every type of fact finding mission. 

But, if this is something you’d use or not use or are unsure of, I would value any feedback. At the stage I’m at, literally any feedback is valuable.

**The Plot**   
The protagonist is a guitarist for a heavy metal band. I think one of the members is this cool old guy who plays the drums and the guys, (female) best friend. 

     
The band hasn't taken off, but the main guy is confident they're going to make it, and he is obsessed with perfecting their sound to the point that they have a falling out. His GF is over it and tries to pressure him to grow up and get a real job.

  
 They meet this other rock band that is popular. The main guy thinks they're pricks, but his female bandmate has a crush on the lead singer.   

  
 The main guy gets all excited at one point because he plays this riff that makes him levitate but then forgets it.     
But it turns out certain melodies can tune into this mystical power, which old bandmate warns the main guy against. It turns out, the old guy was from some crazy monastery that became obsessed with ritualistic sacrifice involving turning people into instruments. The church had tapped too deeply into the dark magic in music, and it turned them into terrible wolf monsters.   

  
Present-day, the more famous band, discovered the ancient evil LP, which turned them into rock gods but also made them hunger for people. So their music bewitches fans who they then eat in disgusting graphic fashion.    

  
Big surprise they almost eat the cute bandmate girl. Who the main guy rescues at the end of the book in a big showdown with the werewolf rock stars.  Costing him his long-time relationship with his GF. 

  
**Style**   
The style was really colourful and cartoony to a certain degree. I also think it might have originally been written by someone Danish? Or it took place somewhere like that?  

  
There are some cool parts where the musicians are performing and you can see these giant demonic/wolf auras. Or they'll be singing and the words wrap around the fans like a green smoke?  I want to say it was called something like Sound of the Beast? 

The main guy had blond hair and a massive nose. I think the evil lead singer had kind of a hipster look to him.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I loved the book because it was something I've never read before, with a hard character to work with. Al Ewing introduces Hulk as a theological being, not a hero, not a monster. Hulk exists to break and destroy, and it can't be stopped, and it doesn't want to stop, so, eventually, Earth's time will come. And then, everything else, until there is nothing left to break. There is no plan behind it, no hidden motifs, no reason. He is a philosophical concept. Hulk is, and because he is, everything else won't. 

&amp;#x200B;

BUT, in the last issue, that idea is gone. Hulk wants to break the world, or rather, the Establishment, because companies are bad, and men of power are corrupted, and they, the Elite, are corrputing and killing the Earth. There is an ideology. A logical reason. Something you can agree too. And it feels wrong. He's gone from Unstoppable Universal Concept whose own existence is proved by itself, to anarchist, freedom fighter, anti-capitalism activist. Why would he care about men killing the green, when both of them will fall by his hands? I don't get it.

310,"A lot of fans hate what Bendis is doing. Has this caused a drop in readership? Because I was always under the impression that the popular Jurgens/Tomasi Rebirth era led to a major boost in sales. Seems kind of weird to me that that DC would just let Bendis walk in and undo the best thing to happen to Superman in years. Like, if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

Did Jurgens and Tomasi want to leave or were they forced out to make way for Bendis? If it’s the latter, surely DC must realise they have made a horrible mistake. Pretty sad that these big corporations won’t listen to the fans. Money, on the other hand, talks. A sharp decline in sales could, fingers crossed, lead to DC stepping in.

The guy is a speedster without being one of those broken DC level ones but fast enough to be a danger to most marvel heroes. His speed exceeds Quicksilver's generally flying at Mach 10 bu once been theorized that he could fly at 99% of the speed of light: 186,282 miles per second (299,792 km/s). 


If that speed wasn't good enough, he also has photokinesis. He can generate from his body a bright white light equivalent at maximum intensity to half million-foot candles. The good thing about that power is that even if a character is durable enough to resist the force, many would still be blinded/stunned.

ENLIGHTENMENT

What if a depressed man has an out-of-body experience that exposes him to the reality that he has buried deep within himself.

In this fast-paced one-shot psychological horror, we are thrown into the life of a depressed and suicidal man. Not knowing of his past or why he is in such a dire state of mind, we can only watch in horror as he descends deeper into the depths of his mind where his demons reside.This project tackles the inner turmoil between personal faith and self resentment. Although the events of his journey are tragic the story depicts a strong and powerful message that leads the way toward enlightenment.

**WHY**

I felt compelled to talk about the wide variety of struggles that affect people with mental illness but telling it through one mans perspective. I was inspired by my family members and some friends who have mental illnesses such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. This story talks about the hardship of the mind as it constantly derails people down a dark path as they face much harder odds than others. Mental illness is real, and this is my interpretation of one persons struggle with his psyche.

429,"Hi,

I am trying to read Spider-Man in absolute **chronological order,** instead of publication order. I am in the beginning reading Amazing Spider-Man(+annuals), Untold Tales of Spider-Man and  **Amazing Fantasy** 15,16-19. The first one is, of course, the original source material, while the second is a series published in the '90s to fill the gaps in Spider-Man's first years of web-slinging. Also, some issues were published (I think) in the late '90s that continued Amazing Fantasy with stories similar to Untold Tales (fill the gaps).

The thing is I am following the 616 Chronological order list, and I see that other issues like ""Spider-Man: Life Story"" has many important parts from those first years (the '60s) in it but has been established as a different reality just for the sake of [Sliding Timescale](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Glossary:Sliding_Timescale).

Also, the 616 list omits some issues like the 6-issue series Marvel published in 2014 titled ""**Learning to Crawl**"" where they revisit these original issues ([Duel to the Death with the Vulture](https://youtu.be/jR8-2oeHJFw) etc.).

A comedy-romance series titled ""**Trouble""** was published where Marvel recounts the lives of Peter's parents and uncle in their youth. 

The third story of the **Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 400** titled ""The Morning After"" deals with the day after Uncle Ben is killed.

In the comic book **Mythos #4** it's a retold of the Spider-Man's origin story, as well as in the second story published in  **Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 60** .

""On the Trail of the Amazing Spider-Man!"" is a story featured in the  **Strange Tales Annual Vol 1 2,** where Johnny Storm is meeting with Peter probably a bit after the events of Amazing Spider-Man #3 or #4

Some parts of the modern storyline "" **The Gauntlet""** feature flashbacks from the events of the first days of Spider-Man, particularly his foes' origin stories.

**Sensational Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 (1996)** revisits the events of ASM 15 where Pete fights Kraven.

After lots of thinking I've placed that  **Avengers Classic Vol 1 11/** **Avengers Vol 1 11** features a story of Pete and the Avengers a bit after 24-27# ASM

**Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man Vol 1 7-9** features a 3-issue story named ""The Bridge"" which is placed right before the senior prom, so it should be between the first story of ASM 28 and the second one in the same issue.

I feel like at times this series was promoted and marketed as THE starting point for X-Men if you've always wanted to get into them but never knew when to start pulling. I have never been the biggest X-Men fan but I do love Hickman and I've been reading Marvel for over 12 years so I had at least some kind of foundation and basic understanding of the X-Men mythos going into this. After finishing HoX/Pox I don't think I would ever recommend these series to anyone who doesn't have at least some knowledge of X-men history and continuity.

Should Hickman be getting more critisism for not making this as assessible as it could've been? 

Should it be the readers responsibility to research past continuity if they want to be invested in a retcon or reboot?

507,"Okay, so I am really tired of not having more open world superhero games. They're a good amount of them, but most of them I either didn't enjoy or have already beat.

I'm not even saying they have to be based on any specific character. Hell, Watch_Dogs was a vigilante game that I loved and it kind of felt like you could be playing a comic book character. Far Cry 5, which I just beat, I pretended to run around as Green Arrow the whole game. Prototype and Infamous are great games. 

I do want more that explicitly make you a hero or villain, not ones where I just pretend I am (like Far Cry).

I mean I love the Injustice games, but they can get kind of boring after a bit. DCUO is fun, but I always find myself having put upgrade points into the wrong skill then getting to a point in the game where I have to reset everything because my character can't beat the enemies. The Arkham games are really fun but very linear. Like there isn't much to do other than the main story. Spider-Man was great.

I, personally, would like a new Superman game. I would also like some games that aren't owned by a company. A Witchblade game might be interesting. I think a really good Iron Man game could be made. A Gambit video game could be interesting. I would REALLY like a Robin video game where you take control of Dick Grayson just after having left Bruce. It could have the same fighting as the Arkham games but make it more free roam with random events, side quest, etc. 

I don't know. As someone who LOVES comics and grew up playing a lot of video games, I feel like they don't crossover enough, and when they do they turn out either really bad or short and very linear.

New, original, big two characters don't sell books and almost never stick around more than a year or so. They just can't compete for popularity against characters that have been building their fanbases for 50 or 60 years.

And a little sad, because if King had developed some of the little vignettes in there into full length stories, it would have been so, so much better than the flaming ass garbage he put out over the last two years.  

It's disconcerting to see that there were two artists working on the issue because I'm a firm believer that a comic should have one artist and one writer working together to put a quality and consistent work.  (Whereas DC and Marvel put out waaaayyyy too many books, many of them drawn with a different artist every month, seemingly plucking meth addicted homeless people from the streets that seem to be only slightly familiar with perspective and the human form.) But if they had stuck with one of these guys, and put out this book once a month using this Annual as an idea guide for stories we could have had something good for the last two years, instead of Batman crying into his cornflakes twice a month.

Johnny's reveal and the ensuing battle were my favorite parts of this run.  I loved the epic scale of the Annihilation saga and this felt very similar.  I loved Johnny's maturation over the course of the book.

The Moloids referring to the Thing as ""The Ben"" brought a smile to my face every time.

I really liked the opening arc with Reed choosing his family over solving everything.  Sometimes Reed is a bit cold, and it was nice to see him recognize that he needs his family more than he wants to solve everything.

My Answers: Deadpool: Its not always but when given to a writer that doesn't understand him, he just comes of as obnoxious, annoying and his lol random humor gets old quick. Writers often don't get how dark and depressing of a character Deadpool is and that uses the humor to cope. It could just be lazy writing but I see this mishandling too often

2) Star Lord: I have read any Guardians books in a while so please correct me if I wrong. But Peter Quill is a clear example of MCU synergy in the worst possible way. They got rid of all his development in the DNA era and writers have tries so hard to turn him into a pale intimidation of his MCU counterpart except with Chris Pratts charismatic acting to make it work.  I feel this about all the guardians by star lord got the worst of it, they just turned him into a clown that no one take seriously which leads to my next  answer.

Spider-Man(In team books): Now this depends on writers but it is obvius that anyone who writes teans books just doesn't underst Peter Parker and writing from only having surface level understanding of the character. Yes he is a wise-craking hero that says quips and is funny but writers seem to make him out as a childish joke. Spider-Man is my favorite comic-book character so it just annoys me,  Even when he quipping and such he knows when to get serious,He is just as capable as a leader as even Captain America and a large portion of heroes have huge respect for him.

My son died Spring of 2018. I have lost passion for my favorite hobby; comics. That is until recently. I started reading again this month. I normally devour comics as soon as I get them, but my reading pile has gotten huge. Probably have a years worth of material to get through.

I finally got around to reading Vision today. All 12 issues in an afternoon.
Now I am struggling with my depression and anxiety. The grief and anger that Vison felt just hit too close to home.

I use comics to relax. To escape. The stories are great at escaping reality but the emotions of the characters are all too real.
I am not complaining though. I appreciate good writing. When a writer captures what I am feeling accurately, its satisfying; almost as if someone conveyed my message for me.

Earlier this month I caught up on some back issues of Titans. Roy becoming a complete mess from the loss of Lian kind of showed me the dark places my grief could have taken me. I took some pride that I have not fallen so far.

This triggered me to think of all the characters who have lost children. Donna Troy, Scarlett Witch, Batman, etc.

I am glad to be reading comics again. For one, it means I am getting better by re-engaging in my interests. Secondly I am enjoying the stories, despite how difficult they can be, it feels nice to be represented.

At the end Vison continues his life by being there for his daughter. I am pleased to say that my wife and I had a daughter since my son's passing. I can't help but be both depressed and inspired by this story.

You all know how the old saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover, and that couldn't be more true for Galacta: Daughter of Galactus, which is a very funny and clever little comic that isn't really horny at all. It's a concept-driven high sci-fi comedy that explores Galacta's relationship with her father Galactus, as well as the ways she interacts with the Marvel Universe. Galacta speaks in this ""old-school sci-fi comic book villain"" kind of way, like Galactus really, that enhances the inherent comedy in the premise and the situations she finds herself in.

It's a 2010 4 issue miniseries on Marvel Unlimited, but each issue is less than 10 pages long, so the whole series is about 2 regular issues long, you could read it in about half an hour. I think many people would enjoy this series; while short, it's a very fun read that uses Marvel lore pretty creatively and it serves as a blueprint for a pretty interesting, potential series. Unfortunately, this character hasn't appeared on regular Marvel continuity ever since, and considering the ending and the ways the story could've been continued in, it's a real shame. Hopefully, more people learn about this character, but I wouldn't hold my breath for a revival anytime soon.

But just like any of us, he wasn't perfect. I would love to see a biopic that showed everything that happened between the two of them. And showed it unbiasedly.

(Or maybe do something similar to ""I, Tanya"". I feel like that would be told the truth without officially knowing what the truth was. Did some unique framework in the storytelling.)

Before anyone sent me any hate mail I want to be clear that I am not exactly anti Stan Lee. But the disputes between him and Kirby have been well-known by people in the industry and by fans. It would be interesting to see that story told to a mass audience. Especially now that superhero movies are the biggest things ever, it might be cool to see more stories about what happens behind the scenes at Comic companies.

I will absolutely admit that I believe their success was 50/50. One couldn't exist without the other. But I always found it ridiculous that Stanley took so much credit for absolutely everything. The way I see it, Stanley was the height of man. He was the guy standing outside of the circus tent on a soapbox with a bullhorn bring me in the crowd. Kirby was the one getting his hands dirty so to speak. He was the one eating fire or hammering Nails into his head. I mean, Stan Lee would be nothing if he didn't have Kirby's talents behind him. Kirby wouldn't be much if he didn't have Stan Lee selling it. ( that's why Kirby's work at DC was a failure.

And then Stan wood fill in all of the word balloons after the fact. Considering how Comics are made these days, that just sounds crazy. But I think I heard once that they just couldn't agree on a story and neither one of them would back down.

507,"I am in love with this series.  Pretty much anything BW does is solid gold to me.  Elsbeth is an awesome character.

However, I’m unsure if the purpose of issue 3.  [Spoiler Alert]. When Dag is about to execute the schizophrenic murderer, he says, “I do this for her.”  What do you think is the deeper meaning behind this issue?  Is BW trying to build character development, or is this just an excuse to show a beheading?  Right now my thoughts are that he wants to show Elsbeth that killing someone isn’t always for revenge, that it can be done out of compassion?

10,"Just curious to see what other people think, especially those that identify as completionists like myself. It seems like every major con (San Diego, Chicago, New York, London) Marvel and a little DC, HAS to announce something new. We can’t give more reveals or details or exclusive insight into what was already announced earlier in the year, oh no. We need more titles! And not just more titles, more ongoings!

Now I started collecting comics in the early 90’s, I’m a late 80’s kid, and got serious about it in say the late aughts. 2010. I’ve seen the rise and fall of age of apocalypse, the launch of a million X books, the dreaded Clone Saga, Batman break his back, St Batman take the batsuit and change it into iron man, Superman die, Reign of Supermen, Cap vs Iron man, I’ve seen a deal....that being said, and hear me out

Do we need a “Scream” ongoing? A “Black Cat”? And that’s not to say these aren’t good. I love...no, LOVE Felicia Hardy. My favorite girlfriend of Spidey’s, close between Gwen and Bobbi for second. But I don’t need an ongoing for her you know? 🤷‍♂️  I’d be waaaay more satisfied getting a limited or maxi series out of her, that way I can live with a defined beginning and end to the narrative. And not just a “oh our numbers are dropping, wrap this whole rising action/plot by next issue.”

I said I was a completionist and that’s true. I’ve collected EVERY Spider related (Amazing, Friendly Neighborhood, Spectacular, Scarlet Spider, Venom, Silk, Miles, Web Warriors, Spider-Woman, 2099, Ham, Superior, Carnage, Symbiote, Life Story, Spider Gwen, Ghost Spider), Wolverine related (Wolverine, Wolverine &amp; the X-Men, Wolverines, Weapon X, All New Wolverine, X-23, Old Man Logan, Dead Man Logan, X-Men Gold, Uncanny, Death of Wolverine, Return of Wolverine, Wolverine Infinity Watch) and Deadpool ( Deadpool, Despicable, Mrs Deadpool, Vs Hawkeye, Vs Old Man Logan, Vs Black Panther, Vs gambit, Vs Thanos, Night of the living, Return of the living, Kilustrated, Vs Deadpool, kills the marvel universe, kills the marvel universe again, Gwenpool, Skottie young pool, Daniel way pool, Assassin, Spider-Man Deadpool, You are Deadpool, Secret Agent). Those characters have been my favorite since I started. I find it’s much easier to collect and more satisfying, even though writing all that Deadpool down was exhausting, to have all those limited series because at least they end and you can live with that and either get it because it piques your interest or not. Compare that to the Spider titles and holy cow! That’s a lot to keep up on.
And now they announced Spider-Man Noir??! Smh 🤦‍♂️ 
Why not trim the fat, have one or two ongoing titles per flagship character, lip the rest of them into some sort of team book, cut the rest, and have a rotating schedule of who get a a limited series next. If you love Gwen, sweet! We’ll start a limited series at the end of the year that crosses over with Amazing. You like Spidey Noir? Awesome! Peter’s going back in time in June in amazing and noir will have a maxi series to follow.

Wouldn’t that be easier? Both to purchase and collect? For the retailer? What do you guys  and girls think.",FireDepartmentComics,"Question about Ongoing series, Limited and Maxi Series",1572029115,17,True,comicbooks,2019-10-25

The story is about a group of heroes that decide to travel to the past to fix something. but when they come back they find out they have f.cked up the timeline. but now they have lost the ability to travel backward and undo what they have done(Probably the whole time machine got destroyed).

Time travel did not effect their existence, but has turned other heroes who did not choose to travel back in time, Evil.

I understand all of it, from the multiverse, the crisis events, to blackest night, the new gods, final crisis, new 52, the hand, the monitors, etc. All of it. It's a mess. It took me time but I got it all down. I was happy with the monitor and the anti monitor.


When Metal came out, I was OK with all the metals, tie ins to final crisis, his bat books. It was great building off his own stories. When his justice league came out it was challenging. You had the 4 super nova gods things in no justice, then you have Perpetua, mother of the monitors and world forger. Adding 6 different forces and 7 alternate forces, totalaties, shards off that split into 8 puzzles with 3 different.... It goes on. And with the speed force, we have still force and that force and each thing with each character spreads out to 15 different other things. It's very hard to get new readers into this stuff and it's bad enough how it was before. Geoff Johns and Grant Morrison crisis and lantern books was the last complicated we had in the DC world but it was at least organized into multiverse. With a whole book on it with multiversity.

I’m a first time poster in this subreddit. I’m looking for the name of a comic I bought when I was kid during the early-mid 90’s. Visually the art style was like earlier Judge Dredd comics. What I can remember of the comic was there were two dukedoms/cults fighting each other for what I think was some god figure. The one cult wore red helmets with a single pointed tip, similar to the god like figure. The other cult was more bulky and wore green colours. Both constructed these strange mechs which housed multiple people. There was also a subplot with one of the royalty figures having a child that was a demon, this demon hid its form from them pretending to be a human baby. The atmosphere was very dark sci-fi fantasy, closest thing I can think of is 40k chaos cults.

220,"I read Geoff Johns' second run on ""The Flash"" with Barry, from ""Flash: Rebirth"" through to ""Flashpoint"". Then I went back and read the last part of the previous volume starring Wally, from issue #231 to #247. Then I went back again and read the series ""Flash: The Fastest Man Alive"" with Bart as the Flash, followed by the ""All Flash"" one-shot.

The beginning of ""Flash: The Fastest Man Alive"" is just dull. The story is dull, the general setup is dull, Bart's roommate Griffin is such a jerk from the start that you have to wonder why they're even friends and it's no surprise at all when he becomes a villain. Bart himself is drained of all personality: his only distinguishing feature is his encyclopaedic knowledge, which isn't a personality trait. The series starts with Jay as the main Flash, and he is automatically more interesting than Bart is, to the point that I'd rather be reading a series about him instead. The series does pick up a little once Bart commits to being the Flash, but only because it gets a sense of direction: all those problems are still there.

The series gets a boost of energy in issue #9 when Marc Guggenheim takes over as writer, but it's too little too late as he had to have known when he began that Bart was gonna die in five issues' time. Bart is finally written with a distinctive voice, but unfortunately it's Wally's voice – his status quo isn't anything like what Wally would be doing, so the series *is* distinctive in that way, but he still sounds like Wally. But I did kind of enjoy these issues... then comes #13, and Bart's death is just really unsatisfying. He didn't need to die in order to stop the explosion, so I don't buy him being at peace with it when it happens. And I don't buy the Rogues killing him either, and especially not killing him and then immediately panicking about it and trying to pin all the blame on Inertia. 

I'd heard that Wally's return was supposed to be bad or mediocre, but I really don't see why. Yes, Mark Waid's arc ""The Wild Wests"" isn't as good as the *best* of his earlier long run but it's still good: I'd put it on par with his work from around ""Presidential Race"" through to ""Hell to Pay"". I actually liked the inclusion of Wally's kids here more than I liked the inclusion of Superman's son in Tomasi's ""Superman"" – I think because Iris and Jai share the same amount of spotlight that Jon gets all to himself, and there's a bit more variety about it with Iris as the bolder one and Jai as the quieter one. And I really liked how both their powers were different because their developing Speed Force connections were expressing in different ways; I thought that was pretty creative. Anyway, the series stays good after Waid leaves. It doesn't end with a bang, but not with a whimper either: more like gliding to a smooth stop.

Then ""Flash: Rebirth"" comes along and ruins everything. Its attempts to convince us that it is so much better than what came before just end up making it so much worse, with how desperately Geoff Johns wants Barry Allen to seem cool. He created the Speed Force, so that makes him important and therefore cool! And he's got a tragic backstory now! The bowties weren't actually his fault! Central City is edgy! Can't help but notice his wife Iris Allen is suddenly de-aged about twenty years too, to be the same age as him. Meanwhile, practically every character cannot stop shilling Barry and talking about how great he is: the first thing Jay says is ""Barry Allen made me the Flash"", which just made me think, ""What? No."" The only dissenting voice is Bart, and the fact that his criticisms of the whole situation are so accurate yet get ignored makes it feel like Geoff Johns saying ""Geoff hears ya. Geoff don't care.""

Then there's what this miniseries does to Wally and his kids. Wally suddenly doesn't have that balance in life between being a superhero and fatherhood that he had in his own series: he has to stay home and be the dorky beleaguered dad so that Barry can look less dorky by comparison. Meanwhile, Jai has suddenly morphed from a quiet nice kid to the most horrendous little brat on the planet, while Iris (sorry, *Irey*) has become a lot more whiny and wilting – then ""Irey"" somehow steals away Jai's Speed Force connection, which turns her from a character with her own distinct power set to just another speedster. But hey, she gets the ""Impulse"" name (possibly to ensure Bart stays Kid Flash the way Geoff Johns arranged it) – and I hope she enjoys it as she is written out of the series along with her family and is never seen as a superhero again. By the way, yes, I know Geoff Johns wanted to write a secondary title called ""Speed Force"" about Wally and his family and Bart until it got cancelled because of the New 52. But given what we know about what would've happened in it – Jai becomes a villain, as the new Turtle, and probably fulfils that premonition about Wally, ""One of your children will destroy your life!"" – I honestly think we dodged a bullet. It's rather have nothing than have Jai West get Superboy-Primed. 

""The Dastardly Death of the Rogues"" is easily the best part of the run with Barry, because it stops trying to *tell* us that Barry's so great and lets us actually just see him in action. And, okay, Barry himself is still kind of bland, but his new status quo is interesting in its own right. And there's that beautiful Francis Manapul art to look at, so I don't even mind the decompressed storytelling that much. Overall I like this story for much the same reasons I like Manapul's run on the New 52 ""Flash"" series: judged on its own merits, it works. I also thought issue #7 with Captain Boomerang was enjoyable, and #8 with Reverse-Flash was interesting.

Then ""Road to Flashpoint"" comes along and poor Geoff just can't help himself, he's right back to shilling Barry at us and insisting that he's so great and the most important and bestest Flash evar. There's something kind of symbolic about the last time we see Wally West before the New 52 erased him: it's in the penultimate issue, and he tells Barry ""Before I knew your secret, I hoped the Flash was Barry Allen"" (which anyone who's read ""Born to Run"" knows is a complete lie) – then when Bart runs away in a temper Wally is about to run after him but Barry stops him and insists ""No, you stay, I'll run"" and goes instead.

""Flashpoint"" is a weird story because it sits kind of halfway between being a Flash story and being a DC-universe-wide Crisis-tier story. The core of the thing is about Barry, but that makes up surprisingly little of the whole – the rest is all subplots and cameos around the wider world of the alternate timeline that ultimately don't even add up to much. Maybe if they'd had more time before the reboot then more of the stuff that ended up in the tie-in miniseries would've ended up in the main event, and properly tipped it over into being an actual Crisis. Speaking of the tie-ins, I have some thoughts about the miniseries ""Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost"" – I thought it was really well-done, and you can tell that Sterling Gates likes Bart a lot as a character, but I have certain problems with Bart's apparent death at the end. I understand why they did it and rebooted the character entirely for the New 52 – because Bart with his history wouldn't have fit at all in the new timeline – but it still galls me that it happens in a tie-in and isn't even *referenced* in the main series. Not only that, but his death is entirely to give Barry a boost. The issue tries to frame it as a triumph (and sure, it's better than his first death) but all it does is drive home how everything is now about Barry. Barry is all, all is Barry.

232,"Is it for his humor and quick wit? Nope.

Is it for his badassery? Nope.

Is it for his crazy personality? Again, nope.

His fowl language? Nope.

I love Deadpool, because he is the ultimate example of coping with pain through humor. Deadpool is hurting. Constantly. Both physically and emotionally. Not only is he a giant, walking, talking, bleeding, bruised, puss-filled tumor, he deals with the emotional trauma of being an ugly freak, and also of the experiments that caused him to be that way in the first place. He has PTSD from those experiments, and once admitted that he can't sleep at night, and that he always has traumatic flashbacks to those horrific events. But even through all of that, he's still cracking jokes and making people smile (or groan) even if inside he's certainly not happy or okay. His superpower too causes him pain. Sure, he's effecfively immortal and can regenerate from anything, but that doesn't mean he can't feel the pain of those injuries anyways. In the movies alone, he's been blown up, torn in half, impaled through the brain, and had his hand chopped clean off. Even from all of that, he's still cracking jokes and one-liners. Surely as a way to cope with the excruciating pain.

There's also his mental health. Saying Deadpool is mentally unstable would one of the greatest understatements in all of the marvel and X-Men universes. He constantly struggles with the likes of PTSD, depression, schitzophrenia, ADHD, and anxiety on a daily basis (from what I see of him and know about mental health). And he doesn't have the luxury of alcohol to dull the pain. Or even drugs to treat his mental illnesses. Due to his ever changing brain chemestry, he can't take an antidepressant. Or a mood stablizer. He deals with his mental problems in full force, day in day out. And he still sticks through it like a trooper trying to be funny and wise cracking. This speaks to me on a personal level. I've never been in the best place mentally, and I see Deadpool as an inspiration to me. No matter how badly he gets maimed, tortured, mocked, insulted, beaten-up, whatever, he always pulls through with a grin on his face and something to say.

Finally there's his emotional pain. Deadpool is up there with Batman as an extremely tragic character. Being raised in a broken home, dealing with cancer, losing multiple loved ones, being mentally unstable; those are just a few examples of exactly how depressing Deadpool actually is. But, once again, even through all that he still puts on a smile and makes light of it, even if it really hurts him.

Deadpool may not be the strongest, or smartest, or even the coolest. But to me, he's one of the most relatable, sympathetic, and endearing characters in all of comic books. In all of fiction, even.

That's why he's my favorite comic book character.

Since Tony Isabella has been talked about alot as of late regarding his Batman comment (which is completely justified), I think it's important to look at something he saved us from.   


&gt;In the late 70's, DC editorial wanted their first black Superhero, so they created, ""The Black Bomber."" They wrote out the first two scripts, and wanted Tony Isabella to take over starting with #3.   
&gt;  
&gt;“In each of the two completed Black Bomber scripts, the white bigot risks his own life to save another person whom he can’t see clearly (in one case, a baby in a stroller) and then reacts in racial slur disgust when he discovers that he risked his life to save a black person. He wasn’t aware that he had two identities, but each identity had a girlfriend and the ladies were aware of the change. To add final insult, the Bomber’s costume was little more than a glorified basketball uniform.  
&gt;  
&gt;“DC had wanted me to take over writing the book with the third issue. I convinced them to eat the two scripts and let me start over. To paraphrase my arguments…  
&gt;  
&gt;” ‘Do you REALLY want DC’s first black super-hero to be a white bigot?’

He also just takes so much joy out of what he does, most of his comic panels have him painted with a disjointed toothy grin as he either does something horrible or just talking, knowing that he has some advantage in the situation.

410,"For those unaware with the term, political correctness, at least in as so far as I've come to understand it until I find a better definition, means:

""the avoidance, often considered as taken to extremes, of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against.""

And based on that, I conclude that political correctness comes from a place of good intent, but what I think is more difficult, especially on a public website on the internet, to discern in regards to a person criticizing political correctness to begin with is what kind of intention said person has. While it's certainly possible to have bad intent when making a criticism (not that specific examples of such cases necessarily need to be emphasized here), I think that it's also possible to have good intent when making a criticism, as I'm sure can be the case for virtually anything that can be inserted into a comic book, including political correctness.

So, assuming everyone for the time being reading this post has good intent when approaching the topic of political correctness, at least until proven otherwise, and with me being inspired to ask this question based on the discussions of political correctness I've been seeing as of late, I ask all of you here when you've felt political correctness in comics has been done well, because I think it can potentially result in some really interesting discussions.",electricmastro,When is political correctness in comics done well?,1572421515,17,True,comicbooks,2019-10-30

475,"Anyone else feel like Johns' time at DC is coming to an end, and that he will end up at Marvel? Let's look at some key facts.

He's lost his executive position at DC Comics. Also his position at DC Films.

He's set up his own imprint at DC called the Killing Zone. Was suppose to start publishing titles in May 2019. We haven't really heard anything. 

His current DC work is wrapping up. Doomsday Clock is almost done. Three Jokers mini is being worked on. Shazam is constantly delayed. Batman Earth One is another graphic novel. I don't think he has any other comic work lined up. Doesn't seem to really be involved much anymore, and even his Three Jokes story might be out of continuity. 

Stargirl is being released on DCUniverse, which is seemingly a dying platform. WW84 is coming out. Green Lantern Corp was suppose to be his next movie, but we just got the announcement that they are making a GL tv show. The movie is probably dead.

Now look at Marvel. Major change with Feige coming on board and taking over the creative side of publishing. Feige and Johns have a history. Feige is also greatly expanding his work, including the Fox properties, Disney+, and Marvel TV projects. 

Johns has spent a long time at DC, but he still seems to love the Marvel side of things. At some point he probably wants to work on those characters. I think the time is coming soon.",matty_nice,Prediction: Geoff Johns joins Marvel,1572472586,34,True,comicbooks,2019-10-30

479,"So for my history seminar class, the topic of the day was anti-totalitarianism. So our teacher assigned another student and I these two reading packets on Monday. The other student had Koestler and I got George Orwell. The reading packet came with a part of Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"". Specifically, the part where O'Brien is questioning Winston Smith and goes onto explain the philosophy of the Party. To those who have not read ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", that contrary to Smith's original assumption, the Party does not use power as a necessary evil to rule over the weak and inept masses. Instead, the Party clings to power for power's sake. A thought occurred in my mind about something. Then, O'Brien talks about how ""freedom is slavery, and slavery is freedom"". In this part, he states that if a man is independent he will always be defeated as death is the ultimate defeat. O'Brien says in order to not suffer this defeat, man must give up any sense of freedom and individuality by joining the Party. In Oceania, the Party is the body and all of the people in it are its cells. When one dies another takes its place. Next, O'Brien asks Smith about how does a man asserts his authority to another? Smith answers with ""By making him suffer."", which is the correct answer. Finally, O'Brien goes onto a spiel about how the Party plan to strip away any positive emotions such as love with negative emotions such as hate. They plan on further transforming Oceania into a civilization based on fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. The Party wants to basically dehumanize the human race and transform them all into glorified puppets because ""God is Power"".

As I was reading this, I actually began to wonder whether or not Jack Kirby had read ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" in the past and thought about using it as a template for Darkseid and Apokolips because of the uncanny similarities I noticed. For starters, the Party basically wish to eradicate free will in Oceania just like Darkseid wants for the universe. Apokolips and Oceania both fear and revere their leaders despite how cruel they are towards them. The Party wants a society where fear and cruelty are the cornerstone, just like Apokolips already has. O'Brien even says that the Party wishes to take away children from their mothers after birth, which is similar to Granny Goodnesses' orphanage. If anything Apokolips is if Oceania had already achieved those goals. Granted ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" is not an obscure novel as it has influenced many works that criticize totalitarianism. That and Kirby was no stranger when it came to anti-fascist comics. I began to look for any evidence of Kirby being influenced by Orwell and his novel but found no evidence whatsoever. Before anyone criticizes me I'm well aware that I'm just probably making an assumption based on some similarities I noticed. If anything its most likely because both Kirby and Orwell borrowed elements from Nazi Germany when it came to designing their respective totalitarian dystopias. It's also likely that writers following Kirby also borrowed elements from ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"". Sort of like this panel from Final Crisis #5:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lthzdwvofrv31.jpg?width=1789&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77bf82883d6084b0286e63434953b8b0a0f0e08

I showed my teacher who has little knowledge regarding Kirby's Fourth World and he admitted that it's likely Morrison could have used ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" as an inspiration for this panel. Especially with him admitting that the lines ""Judge others!"", ""Condemn the Different"", and the slogan ""To die on the job is to die for Darkseid!"" are not too different from those that the Party would propagate. The philosophy of the Party reminded me about why Kirby made the Anti-Life Equation take away free will because Kirby believed that the opposite of life was slavery. In Oceania, the populace are nothing more than slaves who can't even subconsciously think different without being grabbed by the thought police and taken to Airstrip One.

Again, I'm fairly certain I'm just making an assumption, but still the similarities are quite noticeable if you're relatively familiar with both works.",501id5Nak3,Two and Two make Darkseid,1572476971,7,True,comicbooks,2019-10-30

489,"It really occurred to me this week as I got the following *four* books from a single pull:

- Harleen - A Harley Quinn origin story I thought I'd hate, but is actually super compelling and treats her character with a level of tragedy she usually isn't presented with.

- Basketful of Heads - a new Joe Hill horror comic, enough said.

- Joker - Killer Smile - Jeff Lemire writing a Joker story (and the guy at the shop said he's gonna do a Question comic as well!).

- The Last God - picked up on a whim, and probably the best out of all four of these. A fantasy comic that feels incredibly true to the tropes of fantasy (in a positive way), with songs, translated history, and a map of the world.

Beyond these, I've got the best Snyder/Cappulo story is Court of Owls and a sequel to White Knight

I guess I'm just saying these Black Label comics are what I've always wanted from superhero books/comics in general. Writers and artists allowed to create shorter standalone stories, aimed at older audiences, with seemingly with less deadlines and editorial demands constraining quality.

512,"Hello world :-)

I don't know where else to ask. Some years ago I've read about a very young girl publishing a book on how to draw comics.

Unfortunately I can not remember her name, and I've spend a lot of time searching today without results. All I remember is that she was very young (6? 8?) and her dad was a cartoonist - IIRC. The style was simple but clean, and she was very well reflected on the whole process.

As I now work with students, I'd like to show them. I did stop-motion animation with them, and many said they could only draw stick-figures. 

I taught them how to use circles, ""noodle shapes"" to make more plastic characters, and adding simple accessories (hat, shoes...) to give them character and make them distinguishable. It brought some kids from ""I really can't draw"" to a level where they'd doodle up a whole world of figures and scenes. It would be nice to have a kid's guide on how to draw, as I think it'll show them that they are neither too young nor need to spend years to improve.

Knowhere being present in the Seventh and Eighth cosmos, could hint that Knull is only old as the Seventh. But since Knowhere is kinda of a multiversal constant and is present in many univesese, it could mean that remains existed prior to that (since most universes split from a central origin point). Also we know celestials themselves are immune to the end of a cosmos, so it would make sense there remains are as well.
